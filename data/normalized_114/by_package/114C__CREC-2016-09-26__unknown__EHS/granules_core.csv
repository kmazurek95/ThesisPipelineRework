This legislation is clear. Matters related to nuclear deterrence and national security should be the job of Congress and not an unaccountable, international body. Nuclear deterrence is the basis for preserving peace through strength to protect American families. That is why the legislation pledged to defund the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization Preparatory Commission if the President relinquished sovereignty over testing of nuclear weapons, putting American families at risk of attack. Just days after introducing the legislation, the U.N. Security Council approved a meaningless resolution that merely encourages all nations to sign the ban on nuclear testing weapons around the world. This bill reinforces the Senate's constitutional authority to approve all international treaties.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1877) to amend section 520J of the Public Health Service Act to authorize grants for mental health first aid training programs, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 1877 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Mental Health First Aid Act of 2016''. SEC. 2. MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS TRAINING GRANTS. Section 520J of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 290bb-41) is amended-- (1) in the section heading, by inserting ``mental health awareness'' before ``training''; and (2) in subsection (b)-- (A) in the subsection heading, by striking ``Illness'' and inserting ``Health''; (B) in paragraph (1), by inserting ``, veterans, law enforcement, and other categories of individuals, as determined by the Secretary,'' after ``emergency services personnel''; (C) in paragraph (5)-- (i) in the matter preceding subparagraph (A), by striking ``to'' and inserting ``for evidence-based programs that provide education to teachers, personnel, and other categories of individuals described in paragraph (1) on at least''; and (ii) by striking subparagraphs (A) through (C) and inserting the following: ``(A) recognizing the signs and symptoms of mental illness; and ``(B) either-- ``(i) resources available in the community for individuals with a mental illness and other relevant resources; or ``(ii) the safe de-escalation of crisis situations involving individuals with a mental illness.''; and (D) in paragraph (7), by striking ``, $25,000,000'' and all that follows through the period at the end and inserting ``$14,963,000 for each of fiscal years 2017 through 2021.''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky. General Leave Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Kentucky? [[Page H5871]] There was no objection. Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1877, the Mental Health First Aid Act of 2016, introduced by the gentlewoman from Kansas, Representative Lynn Jenkins, and the gentlewoman from California, Representative Doris Matsui. This legislation enjoyed broad support on the Energy and Commerce Committee, passing through a full committee markup on a voice vote. The program we are reauthorizing today is an important one. It is a grant program that helps families and individuals in the community, including pastors, first responders, emergency personnel, nurses, teachers, and others to recognize the signs of mental illness. They are also learning how to deescalate a mental health crisis situation and how to help their neighbors in need connect with resources available for mental health treatment in the community. Finally, H.R. 1877 is fully CutGo compliant. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 1877, the Mental Health First Aid Act of 2016. This important legislation would bolster our Nation's efforts to respond to individuals suffering from mental health disorders and crises. It would reauthorize a grant program to train individuals such as teachers, law enforcement, and veterans, who are likely to encounter people with mental illness. The training would provide tools to help those individuals detect mental illness and provide the initial response, including connecting individuals with mental illness to mental health treatment and service providers in their community. Mental illness can lead to harmful outcomes, and that includes things such as suicide, homelessness, and involvement with the criminal justice system. However, access to early intervention and treatment services can help an individual recover from their condition and lead a productive life. Despite the availability of evidence-based interventions, we know that there are long delays in individuals seeking treatment after the first onset of a mental health condition, and this legislation hopes to reverse that trend. Mental health awareness training will equip more individuals with the ability to identify the signs and symptoms of mental illness and connect people with mental health treatment and support services. This would help decrease the time from the first onset of mental illness to an individual obtaining the treatment and services that they need. I also encourage my colleagues to support this legislation; but I would like to reiterate that, just like with H.R. 2646, the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act which awaits action in the Senate, this is a necessary step, rather than a solution, to improving the mental health system in this country. If we are truly serious about fixing our broken mental health system, we have to work together to expand access and make sustained investments. So again, I want to thank Representatives Matsui and Jenkins for their leadership on this issue. I urge my colleagues to support this important bipartisan bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Kansas (Ms. Jenkins). Ms. JENKINS of Kansas. I thank my friend, the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie), for yielding time. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1877, the Mental Health First Aid Act of 2016. The first step to help someone suffering with a mental illness get the help he or she needs is to be able to quickly spot the signs of mental illness and know where to point that friend, colleague, neighbor, or family member. H.R. 1877 will help police, first responders, veterans' advocates, teachers, and others spot the signs and get people the help they need. It authorizes a grant program that has been included in appropriations bills the past few years and enjoyed great support from Congress and the public. The grant money will go to fund State Bureaus of Prisons, veterans' advocacy groups, EMT and EMS teams, police officers, and firefighters. These important groups will be educated in spotting signs of mental illness in the people they work and live with so they can find help for these individuals. We hear about the state of our mental health system every day and the state of the VA dealing with injured veterans. We hear about police and first responders called to a scene where someone has become dangerous and they are not sure the best way to respond. H.R. 1877 will help those people know how to respond so that the situation can stay in control and the risk of harm to folks is lessened. {time} 1415 The kinds of education programs that this legislation will provide authorization for have been shown to be effective and efficient at teaching people the signs of mental illness and how to drop the stigma of that illness so that someone in need can get help. I am glad that we have decided to take action here today. It is well known that this piece of legislation has been one of my top priorities since coming to Congress, and I am thankful to my colleagues on the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Chairman Upton and Congresswoman Matsui, for taking it up and supporting it. Congresswoman Matsui and I worked on this bill because we both saw the need for training in communities so that people in a position to do so could help those suffering with mental illness. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important bill. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, again, I encourage support of the bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, many Americans know someone who is struggling with a mental illness . . . but we often do not know how to help. For too long . . . stigma has prevented us from seeking the lifesaving information we need to best help someone experiencing a mental health crisis. By equipping our first responders . . . law enforcement personnel . . . and educators with training and knowledge . . . Mental Health First Aid courses are helping break down barriers and de-escalate crises in our communities. We have seen positive results from these courses in Sacramento . . . and across the country. By passing H.R. 1877 today . . . we reauthorize important grant funding that will allow for the implementation of the Mental Health First Aid model nationally. I want to thank Congresswoman Lynn Jenkins for her work on this important legislation. Today represents one step forward in our efforts to address the mental health crisis in this country. Yet . . . the need for comprehensive reform remains. We need to put adequate resources toward our behavioral health workforce . . . and ensure parity between physical and mental health care for all Americans. I will continue to strongly advocate for a legislative framework that supports this entire spectrum of care . . . and I urge my colleagues to join me in those efforts. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1877, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [House] [Pages H5870-H5871] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID ACT OF 2016 Mr. GUTHRIE.

H.R. 1877 will help police, first responders, veterans' advocates, teachers, and others spot the signs and get people the help they need. It authorizes a grant program that has been included in appropriations bills the past few years and enjoyed great support from Congress and the public. The grant money will go to fund State Bureaus of Prisons, veterans' advocacy groups, EMT and EMS teams, police officers, and firefighters. These important groups will be educated in spotting signs of mental illness in the people they work and live with so they can find help for these individuals. We hear about the state of our mental health system every day and the state of the VA dealing with injured veterans. We hear about police and first responders called to a scene where someone has become dangerous and they are not sure the best way to respond. H.R. 1877 will help those people know how to respond so that the situation can stay in control and the risk of harm to folks is lessened. {time} 1415 The kinds of education programs that this legislation will provide authorization for have been shown to be effective and efficient at teaching people the signs of mental illness and how to drop the stigma of that illness so that someone in need can get help. I am glad that we have decided to take action here today. It is well known that this piece of legislation has been one of my top priorities since coming to Congress, and I am thankful to my colleagues on the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Chairman Upton and Congresswoman Matsui, for taking it up and supporting it. Congresswoman Matsui and I worked on this bill because we both saw the need for training in communities so that people in a position to do so could help those suffering with mental illness. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important bill. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, again, I encourage support of the bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, many Americans know someone who is struggling with a mental illness . . . but we often do not know how to help. For too long . . . stigma has prevented us from seeking the lifesaving information we need to best help someone experiencing a mental health crisis. By equipping our first responders . . . law enforcement personnel . . . and educators with training and knowledge . . . Mental Health First Aid courses are helping break down barriers and de-escalate crises in our communities. We have seen positive results from these courses in Sacramento . . . and across the country. By passing H.R. 1877 today . . . we reauthorize important grant funding that will allow for the implementation of the Mental Health First Aid model nationally. I want to thank Congresswoman Lynn Jenkins for her work on this important legislation. Today represents one step forward in our efforts to address the mental health crisis in this country. Yet . . . the need for comprehensive reform remains. We need to put adequate resources toward our behavioral health workforce . . . and ensure parity between physical and mental health care for all Americans. I will continue to strongly advocate for a legislative framework that supports this entire spectrum of care . . . and I urge my colleagues to join me in those efforts. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1877, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_204.csv,10102,10102,10174,"[congressional record volume 162, number 145 (monday, september 26, 2016)] [house] [pages h5870-h5871] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] mental health first aid act of 2016 mr. guthrie. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 1877) to amend section 520j of the public health service act to authorize grants for mental health first aid training programs, as amended. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 1877 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``mental health first aid act of 2016''. sec. 2. mental health awareness training grants. section 520j of the public health service act (42 u.s.c. 290bb-41) is amended-- (1) in the section heading, by inserting ``mental health awareness'' before ``training''; and (2) in subsection (b)-- (a) in the subsection heading, by striking ``illness'' and inserting ``health''; (b) in paragraph (1), by inserting ``, veterans, law enforcement, and other categories of individuals, as determined by the secretary,'' after ``emergency services personnel''; (c) in paragraph (5)-- (i) in the matter preceding subparagraph (a), by striking ``to'' and inserting ``for evidence-based programs that provide education to teachers, personnel, and other categories of individuals described in paragraph (1) on at least''; and (ii) by striking subparagraphs (a) through (c) and inserting the following: ``(a) recognizing the signs and symptoms of mental illness; and ``(b) either-- ``(i) resources available in the community for individuals with a mental illness and other relevant resources; or ``(ii) the safe de-escalation of crisis situations involving individuals with a mental illness.''; and (d) in paragraph (7), by striking ``, $25,000,000'' and all that follows through the period at the end and inserting ``$14,963,000 for each of fiscal years 2017 through 2021.''. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from kentucky (mr. guthrie) and the gentleman from new jersey (mr. pallone) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from kentucky. general leave mr. guthrie. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the record on the bill. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from kentucky? [[page h5871]] there was no objection. mr. guthrie. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of h.r. 1877, the mental health first aid act of 2016, introduced by the gentlewoman from kansas, representative lynn jenkins, and the gentlewoman from california, representative doris matsui. this legislation enjoyed broad support on the energy and commerce committee, passing through a full committee markup on a voice vote. the program we are reauthorizing today is an important one. it is a grant program that helps families and individuals in the community, including pastors, first responders, emergency personnel, nurses, teachers, and others to recognize the signs of mental illness. they are also learning how to deescalate a mental health crisis situation and how to help their neighbors in need connect with resources available for mental health treatment in the community. finally, h.r. 1877 is fully cutgo compliant. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to support this legislation. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. pallone. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i rise in support of h.r. 1877, the mental health first aid act of 2016. this important legislation would bolster our nation's efforts to respond to individuals suffering from mental health disorders and crises. it would reauthorize a grant program to train individuals such as teachers, law enforcement, and veterans, who are likely to encounter people with mental illness. the training would provide tools to help those individuals detect mental illness and provide the initial response, including connecting individuals with mental illness to mental health treatment and service providers in their community. mental illness can lead to harmful outcomes, and that includes things such as suicide, homelessness, and involvement with the criminal justice system. however, access to early intervention and treatment services can help an individual recover from their condition and lead a productive life. despite the availability of evidence-based interventions, we know that there are long delays in individuals seeking treatment after the first onset of a mental health condition, and this legislation hopes to reverse that trend. mental health awareness training will equip more individuals with the ability to identify the signs and symptoms of mental illness and connect people with mental health treatment and support services. this would help decrease the time from the first onset of mental illness to an individual obtaining the treatment and services that they need. i also encourage my colleagues to support this legislation; but i would like to reiterate that, just like with h.r. 2646, the helping families in mental health crisis act which awaits action in the senate, this is a necessary step, rather than a solution, to improving the mental health system in this country. if we are truly serious about fixing our broken mental health system, we have to work together to expand access and make sustained investments. so again, i want to thank representatives matsui and jenkins for their leadership on this issue. i urge my colleagues to support this important bipartisan bill. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. guthrie. mr. speaker, i yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from kansas (ms. jenkins). ms. jenkins of kansas. i thank my friend, the gentleman from kentucky (mr. guthrie), for yielding time. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of h.r. 1877, the mental health first aid act of 2016. the first step to help someone suffering with a mental illness get the help he or she needs is to be able to quickly spot the signs of mental illness and know where to point that friend, colleague, neighbor, or family member. h.r. 1877 will help police, first responders, veterans' advocates, teachers, and others spot the signs and get people the help they need. it authorizes a grant program that has been included in appropriations bills the past few years and enjoyed great support from congress and the public. the grant money will go to fund state bureaus of prisons, veterans' advocacy groups, emt and ems teams, police officers, and firefighters. these important groups will be educated in spotting signs of mental illness in the people they work and live with so they can find help for these individuals. we hear about the state of our mental health system every day and the state of the va dealing with injured veterans. we hear about police and first responders called to a scene where someone has become dangerous and they are not sure the best way to respond. h.r. 1877 will help those people know how to respond so that the situation can stay in control and the risk of harm to folks is lessened. {time} 1415 the kinds of education programs that this legislation will provide authorization for have been shown to be effective and efficient at teaching people the signs of mental illness and how to drop the stigma of that illness so that someone in need can get help. i am glad that we have decided to take action here today. it is well known that this piece of legislation has been one of my top priorities since coming to congress, and i am thankful to my colleagues on the house committee on energy and commerce, chairman upton and congresswoman matsui, for taking it up and supporting it. congresswoman matsui and i worked on this bill because we both saw the need for training in communities so that people in a position to do so could help those suffering with mental illness. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to support this important bill. mr. pallone. mr. speaker, i urge support for this legislation. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. guthrie. mr. speaker, again, i encourage support of the bill. i yield back the balance of my time. ms. matsui. mr. speaker, many americans know someone who is struggling with a mental illness . . . but we often do not know how to help. for too long . . . stigma has prevented us from seeking the lifesaving information we need to best help someone experiencing a mental health crisis. by equipping our first responders . . . law enforcement personnel . . . and educators with training and knowledge . . . mental health first aid courses are helping break down barriers and de-escalate crises in our communities. we have seen positive results from these courses in sacramento . . . and across the country. by passing h.r. 1877 today . . . we reauthorize important grant funding that will allow for the implementation of the mental health first aid model nationally. i want to thank congresswoman lynn jenkins for her work on this important legislation. today represents one step forward in our efforts to address the mental health crisis in this country. yet . . . the need for comprehensive reform remains. we need to put adequate resources toward our behavioral health workforce . . . and ensure parity between physical and mental health care for all americans. i will continue to strongly advocate for a legislative framework that supports this entire spectrum of care . . . and i urge my colleagues to join me in those efforts. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from kentucky (mr. guthrie) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 1877, as amended. the question was taken;

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky. General Leave Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials into the Record on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Kentucky? There was no objection. Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3537, the Dangerous Synthetic Drug Control Act of 2016. I want to specifically acknowledge Congressman Dent from Pennsylvania and Congressman Katko from New York for their tireless leadership on this issue and the teamwork it took to get this bill through the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and to the floor today. According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, the DEA, abuse and misuse of designer synthetic drugs is an ongoing threat to public health and safety. These chemical compounds are often designed in overseas laboratories to mimic the effects of illicit drugs and known controlled substances. Criminals who develop and market them in communities across our country have been able to stay one step ahead of the DEA since--while they are designed to closely resemble controlled substances--they are not currently scheduled. H.R. 3537 will add 22 such compounds to schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, immediately strengthening the DEA's ability to take swift action and get them off our streets. The compounds on this list include those that are marketed as K2, or Spice, as well as fentanyl derivatives estimated to be 100 times more powerful than morphine and linked to many overdoses and deaths. In addition to the DEA, I would like to thank the Office of National Drug Control Policy, FDA, NIH, and those in the research community who helped review and revise this list of synthetics as part of the legislative process. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. House of Representatives, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC, September 26, 2016. Hon. Fred Upton, Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Upton: I write with respect to H.R. 3537, the ``Synthetic Drug Control Act of 2015,'' which was referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce and in addition to the Committee on the Judiciary. As a result of your having consulted with us on provisions within H.R. 3537 that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary, I agree to discharge our committee from further consideration of this bill so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor for consideration. The Judiciary Committee takes this action with our mutual understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 3537 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject matter contained in this or similar legislation and that our committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. Our committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or similar legislation and asks that you support any such request. I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming this understanding with respect to H.R. 3537 and would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R. 3537. Sincerely, Bob Goodlatte, Chairman. ____ House of Representatives, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC, September 26, 2016. Hon. Bob Goodlatte, Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Goodlatte: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 3537, the ``Synthetic Drug Control Act of 2015.'' As you noted, there are provisions of the bill that fall within the Committee on the Judiciary's Rule X jurisdiction. I appreciate your willingness to forgo consideration of H.R. 3537, and I agree that your decision is not a waiver of any of the Committee on the Judiciary's jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and that the Committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as this bill or similar legislation moves forward. In addition, I understand that the Committee reserves the right to seek the appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or similar legislation, and you will have my support for any such request. I will include a copy of your letter and this response in the Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R. 3537. Sincerely, Fred Upton, Chairman. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. H.R. 3537, the Dangerous Synthetic Drug Control Act, is bipartisan legislation sponsored by Mr. Dent of Pennsylvania and also by Congressman Jim Himes of Connecticut. It is a targeted approach to addressing the latest threat from synthetic substances that is causing dangerous drug abuse across our communities, and I support its swift passage. Sadly, stories of adults and teenagers abusing synthetic substances to get high have become all too common and have resulted in individuals either harming themselves or others. These drugs are extremely unsafe and can cause convulsions, anxiety attacks, hallucinations, psychotic episodes, and, in some instances, death. The rise of synthetic drug use is an issue we have been dealing with for many years now in my home State of New Jersey. Frightening increases in overdoses and deaths throughout the State from so-called designer drugs led New Jersey to permanently ban synthetic marijuana in 2012. However, synthetic marijuana, commonly referred to as ``K2'' or ``Spice,'' is still being sold illegally in my State and others and sends many to the emergency room every week. Last year, according to data from the American Association of Poison Control Centers, New Jersey logged 142 emergency calls, the ninth-most in the Nation, for exposure to synthetic marijuana. Despite the devastating impact of these substances, they are, unfortunately, not illegal and, as a result, are [[Page H5873]] too readily available. Under its current authority, the Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA, has difficulty taking action against manufacturers of these substances. By swiftly engineering and reengineering these synthetic compounds, manufacturers have been able to avoid regulation under the Controlled Substances Act. H.R. 3537 would schedule a narrow list of 22 synthetic substances, including 11 used to create synthetic marijuana, and three derivatives of fentanyl--a synthetic opioid that is more powerful than morphine. This targeted legislation was developed with input from the DEA, the Department of Health and Human Services, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and the Office of National Drug Control Policy to ensure that these substances with known abuse potential have no therapeutic value and, therefore, should be appropriately moved to schedule I. I believe that this legislation will enable the DEA to take needed enforcement actions against manufacturers of these dangerous substances. While the bill does not address the broader concerns that have been raised related to access to schedule I substances for research purposes, I am committed to continuing to work with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, as well as the administration, and stakeholders to find ways we can streamline the registration process for legitimate research purposes. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3537. I thank, again, Congressman Himes, and I look forward to continue to work with my colleagues to reduce the availability of dangerous synthetic substances. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Dent). Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman Upton; Ranking Member Pallone; Messrs. Guthrie, Katko, and Himes; Eleanor Holmes Norton; and Congressman Jolly, all for helping to bring this bipartisan bill up today in order to officially identify these dangerous synthetic substances and address the public health crisis presented by their continued proliferation throughout the country. I have been working for several years to bring attention to the very serious threat that synthetic drugs pose to the health and safety of communities both within Pennsylvania and across our Nation. Although initially successful after placing a number of synthetic cannabinoids on schedule I and enhancing the DEA's authorities to protect the public from these drugs through legislation that was signed into law in 2012, we have begun to see a renewed rise in both the number of new substances on the streets and the number of victims affected by these products. This bill simply adds 22 compounds to schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, and these are, frankly, the very worst of the worst compounds out there. The products targeted by this bill are primarily labeled as synthetic marijuana, bath salts, or synthetic opioids, which are sold under the labels like K2, Spice, and Flakka that allow them to be marketed to unsuspecting young people and some of the most vulnerable members of our society. Through modifications to the chemical formulas of these drugs, their overseas manufacturers have been able to continue to push them on to victims under the false impression that they are safe, despite often being even more potent than the drugs they are designed to mimic. Without action--like the step we are taking here today to pass this critical bill and designate these substances as the dangerous and abusive products that they are--we will continue to see more overdoses, more victims, and, sadly, more deaths. Just this month, there was a gruesome killing in my district that was fueled by the ingestion of the synthetic drug known as Flakka-- absolutely gruesome. My friend, Congressman Himes, can talk about a situation very close to him, too, where there was a tragedy. Unfortunately, data from our health centers, law enforcement entities, and poison control offices show that such cases have become more and more prevalent around the country, and I applaud this proactive action to stop further proliferation. I should note that when we passed a law in 2012, we did shut down so much of these synthetic drugs that were being sold. We shut it down. But these folks overseas have figured out ways to reformulate these compounds, and this problem is back with us today again. We had shut it down. It is back with us, and this is a step that we are taking. So, again, I would also like to thank all of these bipartisan cosponsors for their partnership in this effort and their commitment to work together to address this public health epidemic by getting these dangerous substances off the streets. Finally, I would like to mention one other thing, too--that this bill has gone through an extensive regular order process. There has been a hearing, subcommittee markup, and a full committee markup. The bill is the result of negotiations between the DEA, researchers, and many others. Organizations like the American Hospital Association, the American College of Emergency Room Physicians, the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Association of Convenience Stores, and Former Special Agents of the FBI all support and endorse this bill. So, finally, I urge my colleagues to support passage of this important legislation today so we can save lives. I will continue my efforts to educate the public about the dangers of these synthetic drugs and to protect our communities. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Himes), the Democratic sponsor of the bill. Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Pallone for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Dangerous Synthetic Drug Control Act, which will reclassify 22 dangerous synthetic substances as schedule I substances subject to the control and enforcement associated with schedule I substances. Mr. Speaker, the community I represent, like every community represented in this Chamber, has been visited by the tragedy of fatal drug overdoses. We know the statistics nationally--opioid deaths are in the 30,000 neighborhood. That is a tragedy around the country. The substances that we reclassify today include some of the fentanyl substances that are often associated with the most gruesome overdoses often mixed with heroin. My colleagues will remember that fentanyl is the drug actually responsible for the overdose death of the musician Prince and, sadly, is pervasive through our communities. The synthetic drugs that are being scheduled today through this bill are particularly pernicious because they are marketed often in corner retail establishments and often in ways designed to appeal to young people in colored packages with names like K2 and Spice, clearly targeting our youngest constituents. We are engaged, of course, in a cat-and-mouse game with the producers of these substances because as soon as a substance is scheduled, a chemist somewhere figures out a slight alteration to the formula in such a way that now they have a drug which is untested and unproven but mimics some of the effects of a scheduled drug; but we have no idea what the effects are, and all too often those effects can be devastating to the individual using them. {time} 1430 This bill, again, will take 22 of those dangerous substances and classify them into schedule I. This is going to make my community in southwestern Connecticut safer, and it will make communities throughout this country safer. I really want to thank, in particular, Congressman Dent for his very hard work on this, and Chairman Upton and Ranking Member Pallone for expediting this bill in a way that I know is going to make a very positive difference in our communities. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I encourage the adoption of this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3537, the so-called Dangerous Synthetic Drug Control Act of 2016. [[Page H5874]] The legislation would add 22 synthetic drugs to Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. While some of these drugs may be indeed dangerous to the public, we know very little about many of them and adding them to Schedule I would seriously hinder research. Furthermore, by adding these synthetic drugs to Schedule I, the legislation would significantly expand the mandatory minimum found in title 21, section 841(b)(1)(C) of the U.S. Code. If an individual is convicted of selling, distributing, or making one of these drugs, he would be subject to a 20 year mandatory minimum sentence if someone is seriously injured or dies from using these drugs. And it doesn't stop there. Adding these synthetic drugs to Schedule I would also subject this 20 year mandatory minimum to other individuals that may get wrapped up in a drug conspiracy, per title 21, section 846. Technically, a girlfriend that takes a phone message or drives her drug dealer boyfriend to a drug deal for one of these synthetic drugs could be included in the boyfriend's drug conspiracy and be subject to the same 20 year mandatory minimum if someone is seriously injured or dies from using the drugs involved in the conspiracy. An individual who has intentionally sold, distributed, or manufactured these synthetic drugs, if they are indeed dangerous, should be held criminally responsible if someone is harmed or dies using them. However, I believe a judge, not Congress, should be the one determining the sentence based on the individual facts and circumstances. For decades now, research and evidence has demonstrated that mandatory minimums are ineffective deterrents, waste the taxpayers' money, force judges to impose irrational sentences, and discriminate against minorities, particularly with regards to drug offenses. Unfortunately, there are already too many mandatory minimums in the federal code. Mr. Speaker, many Americans wonder how low level drug offenders get decades long sentences. It's because of bills like this that there are thousands of low level, non-violent, first time offenders serving decades behind bars. If we ever expect to do anything about that problem and actually address the drivers of mass incarceration generally, the first step we have to take is to stop passing new mandatory minimums or bills that expand existing mandatory minimums. The mandatory minimums in the code today did not get there all at once--they got there one at a time, each one part of a larger bill, which on balance might have been a good idea. Therefore, the only way to stop passing new mandatory minimums is to stop passing bills that contain mandatory minimums. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote No on H.R. 3537. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, today, I will vote against H.R. 3537. No doubt many of these substances are horrific, and none of us wants to see people abusing them. DEA can act on these drugs, has a process to do it, and should start down that path immediately. However, if we are going to deal with Schedule I, the first thing we should do is eliminate marijuana from Schedule I, which enabled the failed policy of prohibition. Political interference is what got us here in the first place, and we should fix it. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3537, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. AMASH. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [House] [Pages H5871-H5874] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DANGEROUS SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL ACT OF 2016 Mr. GUTHRIE.

We know the statistics nationally--opioid deaths are in the 30,000 neighborhood. That is a tragedy around the country. The substances that we reclassify today include some of the fentanyl substances that are often associated with the most gruesome overdoses often mixed with heroin. My colleagues will remember that fentanyl is the drug actually responsible for the overdose death of the musician Prince and, sadly, is pervasive through our communities. The synthetic drugs that are being scheduled today through this bill are particularly pernicious because they are marketed often in corner retail establishments and often in ways designed to appeal to young people in colored packages with names like K2 and Spice, clearly targeting our youngest constituents. We are engaged, of course, in a cat-and-mouse game with the producers of these substances because as soon as a substance is scheduled, a chemist somewhere figures out a slight alteration to the formula in such a way that now they have a drug which is untested and unproven but mimics some of the effects of a scheduled drug; but we have no idea what the effects are, and all too often those effects can be devastating to the individual using them. {time} 1430 This bill, again, will take 22 of those dangerous substances and classify them into schedule I. This is going to make my community in southwestern Connecticut safer, and it will make communities throughout this country safer. I really want to thank, in particular, Congressman Dent for his very hard work on this, and Chairman Upton and Ranking Member Pallone for expediting this bill in a way that I know is going to make a very positive difference in our communities. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I encourage the adoption of this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3537, the so-called Dangerous Synthetic Drug Control Act of 2016. [[Page H5874]] The legislation would add 22 synthetic drugs to Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. While some of these drugs may be indeed dangerous to the public, we know very little about many of them and adding them to Schedule I would seriously hinder research. Furthermore, by adding these synthetic drugs to Schedule I, the legislation would significantly expand the mandatory minimum found in title 21, section 841(b)(1)(C) of the U.S. Code. If an individual is convicted of selling, distributing, or making one of these drugs, he would be subject to a 20 year mandatory minimum sentence if someone is seriously injured or dies from using these drugs. And it doesn't stop there. Adding these synthetic drugs to Schedule I would also subject this 20 year mandatory minimum to other individuals that may get wrapped up in a drug conspiracy, per title 21, section 846. Technically, a girlfriend that takes a phone message or drives her drug dealer boyfriend to a drug deal for one of these synthetic drugs could be included in the boyfriend's drug conspiracy and be subject to the same 20 year mandatory minimum if someone is seriously injured or dies from using the drugs involved in the conspiracy. An individual who has intentionally sold, distributed, or manufactured these synthetic drugs, if they are indeed dangerous, should be held criminally responsible if someone is harmed or dies using them. However, I believe a judge, not Congress, should be the one determining the sentence based on the individual facts and circumstances. For decades now, research and evidence has demonstrated that mandatory minimums are ineffective deterrents, waste the taxpayers' money, force judges to impose irrational sentences, and discriminate against minorities, particularly with regards to drug offenses. Unfortunately, there are already too many mandatory minimums in the federal code. Mr. Speaker, many Americans wonder how low level drug offenders get decades long sentences. It's because of bills like this that there are thousands of low level, non-violent, first time offenders serving decades behind bars. If we ever expect to do anything about that problem and actually address the drivers of mass incarceration generally, the first step we have to take is to stop passing new mandatory minimums or bills that expand existing mandatory minimums. The mandatory minimums in the code today did not get there all at once--they got there one at a time, each one part of a larger bill, which on balance might have been a good idea. Therefore, the only way to stop passing new mandatory minimums is to stop passing bills that contain mandatory minimums. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote No on H.R. 3537. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, today, I will vote against H.R. 3537. No doubt many of these substances are horrific, and none of us wants to see people abusing them. DEA can act on these drugs, has a process to do it, and should start down that path immediately. However, if we are going to deal with Schedule I, the first thing we should do is eliminate marijuana from Schedule I, which enabled the failed policy of prohibition. Political interference is what got us here in the first place, and we should fix it. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3537, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. AMASH. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [House] [Pages H5871-H5874] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DANGEROUS SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL ACT OF 2016 Mr. GUTHRIE.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky. General Leave Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials into the Record on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Kentucky? There was no objection. Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3537, the Dangerous Synthetic Drug Control Act of 2016. I want to specifically acknowledge Congressman Dent from Pennsylvania and Congressman Katko from New York for their tireless leadership on this issue and the teamwork it took to get this bill through the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and to the floor today. According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, the DEA, abuse and misuse of designer synthetic drugs is an ongoing threat to public health and safety. These chemical compounds are often designed in overseas laboratories to mimic the effects of illicit drugs and known controlled substances. Criminals who develop and market them in communities across our country have been able to stay one step ahead of the DEA since--while they are designed to closely resemble controlled substances--they are not currently scheduled. H.R. 3537 will add 22 such compounds to schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, immediately strengthening the DEA's ability to take swift action and get them off our streets. The compounds on this list include those that are marketed as K2, or Spice, as well as fentanyl derivatives estimated to be 100 times more powerful than morphine and linked to many overdoses and deaths. In addition to the DEA, I would like to thank the Office of National Drug Control Policy, FDA, NIH, and those in the research community who helped review and revise this list of synthetics as part of the legislative process. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. House of Representatives, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC, September 26, 2016. Hon. Fred Upton, Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Upton: I write with respect to H.R. 3537, the ``Synthetic Drug Control Act of 2015,'' which was referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce and in addition to the Committee on the Judiciary. As a result of your having consulted with us on provisions within H.R. 3537 that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary, I agree to discharge our committee from further consideration of this bill so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor for consideration. The Judiciary Committee takes this action with our mutual understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 3537 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject matter contained in this or similar legislation and that our committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. Our committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or similar legislation and asks that you support any such request. I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming this understanding with respect to H.R. 3537 and would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R. 3537. Sincerely, Bob Goodlatte, Chairman. ____ House of Representatives, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC, September 26, 2016. Hon. Bob Goodlatte, Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Goodlatte: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 3537, the ``Synthetic Drug Control Act of 2015.'' As you noted, there are provisions of the bill that fall within the Committee on the Judiciary's Rule X jurisdiction. I appreciate your willingness to forgo consideration of H.R. 3537, and I agree that your decision is not a waiver of any of the Committee on the Judiciary's jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and that the Committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as this bill or similar legislation moves forward. In addition, I understand that the Committee reserves the right to seek the appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or similar legislation, and you will have my support for any such request. I will include a copy of your letter and this response in the Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R. 3537. Sincerely, Fred Upton, Chairman. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. H.R. 3537, the Dangerous Synthetic Drug Control Act, is bipartisan legislation sponsored by Mr. Dent of Pennsylvania and also by Congressman Jim Himes of Connecticut. It is a targeted approach to addressing the latest threat from synthetic substances that is causing dangerous drug abuse across our communities, and I support its swift passage. Sadly, stories of adults and teenagers abusing synthetic substances to get high have become all too common and have resulted in individuals either harming themselves or others. These drugs are extremely unsafe and can cause convulsions, anxiety attacks, hallucinations, psychotic episodes, and, in some instances, death. The rise of synthetic drug use is an issue we have been dealing with for many years now in my home State of New Jersey. Frightening increases in overdoses and deaths throughout the State from so-called designer drugs led New Jersey to permanently ban synthetic marijuana in 2012. However, synthetic marijuana, commonly referred to as ``K2'' or ``Spice,'' is still being sold illegally in my State and others and sends many to the emergency room every week. Last year, according to data from the American Association of Poison Control Centers, New Jersey logged 142 emergency calls, the ninth-most in the Nation, for exposure to synthetic marijuana. Despite the devastating impact of these substances, they are, unfortunately, not illegal and, as a result, are [[Page H5873]] too readily available. Under its current authority, the Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA, has difficulty taking action against manufacturers of these substances. By swiftly engineering and reengineering these synthetic compounds, manufacturers have been able to avoid regulation under the Controlled Substances Act. H.R. 3537 would schedule a narrow list of 22 synthetic substances, including 11 used to create synthetic marijuana, and three derivatives of fentanyl--a synthetic opioid that is more powerful than morphine. This targeted legislation was developed with input from the DEA, the Department of Health and Human Services, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and the Office of National Drug Control Policy to ensure that these substances with known abuse potential have no therapeutic value and, therefore, should be appropriately moved to schedule I. I believe that this legislation will enable the DEA to take needed enforcement actions against manufacturers of these dangerous substances. While the bill does not address the broader concerns that have been raised related to access to schedule I substances for research purposes, I am committed to continuing to work with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, as well as the administration, and stakeholders to find ways we can streamline the registration process for legitimate research purposes. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3537. I thank, again, Congressman Himes, and I look forward to continue to work with my colleagues to reduce the availability of dangerous synthetic substances. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Dent). Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman Upton; Ranking Member Pallone; Messrs. Guthrie, Katko, and Himes; Eleanor Holmes Norton; and Congressman Jolly, all for helping to bring this bipartisan bill up today in order to officially identify these dangerous synthetic substances and address the public health crisis presented by their continued proliferation throughout the country. I have been working for several years to bring attention to the very serious threat that synthetic drugs pose to the health and safety of communities both within Pennsylvania and across our Nation. Although initially successful after placing a number of synthetic cannabinoids on schedule I and enhancing the DEA's authorities to protect the public from these drugs through legislation that was signed into law in 2012, we have begun to see a renewed rise in both the number of new substances on the streets and the number of victims affected by these products. This bill simply adds 22 compounds to schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, and these are, frankly, the very worst of the worst compounds out there. The products targeted by this bill are primarily labeled as synthetic marijuana, bath salts, or synthetic opioids, which are sold under the labels like K2, Spice, and Flakka that allow them to be marketed to unsuspecting young people and some of the most vulnerable members of our society. Through modifications to the chemical formulas of these drugs, their overseas manufacturers have been able to continue to push them on to victims under the false impression that they are safe, despite often being even more potent than the drugs they are designed to mimic. Without action--like the step we are taking here today to pass this critical bill and designate these substances as the dangerous and abusive products that they are--we will continue to see more overdoses, more victims, and, sadly, more deaths. Just this month, there was a gruesome killing in my district that was fueled by the ingestion of the synthetic drug known as Flakka-- absolutely gruesome. My friend, Congressman Himes, can talk about a situation very close to him, too, where there was a tragedy. Unfortunately, data from our health centers, law enforcement entities, and poison control offices show that such cases have become more and more prevalent around the country, and I applaud this proactive action to stop further proliferation. I should note that when we passed a law in 2012, we did shut down so much of these synthetic drugs that were being sold. We shut it down. But these folks overseas have figured out ways to reformulate these compounds, and this problem is back with us today again. We had shut it down. It is back with us, and this is a step that we are taking. So, again, I would also like to thank all of these bipartisan cosponsors for their partnership in this effort and their commitment to work together to address this public health epidemic by getting these dangerous substances off the streets. Finally, I would like to mention one other thing, too--that this bill has gone through an extensive regular order process. There has been a hearing, subcommittee markup, and a full committee markup. The bill is the result of negotiations between the DEA, researchers, and many others. Organizations like the American Hospital Association, the American College of Emergency Room Physicians, the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Association of Convenience Stores, and Former Special Agents of the FBI all support and endorse this bill. So, finally, I urge my colleagues to support passage of this important legislation today so we can save lives. I will continue my efforts to educate the public about the dangers of these synthetic drugs and to protect our communities. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Himes), the Democratic sponsor of the bill. Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Pallone for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Dangerous Synthetic Drug Control Act, which will reclassify 22 dangerous synthetic substances as schedule I substances subject to the control and enforcement associated with schedule I substances. Mr. Speaker, the community I represent, like every community represented in this Chamber, has been visited by the tragedy of fatal drug overdoses.

get them off our streets. the compounds on this list include those that are marketed as k2, or spice, as well as fentanyl derivatives estimated to be 100 times more powerful than morphine and linked to many overdoses and deaths. in addition to the dea, i would like to thank the office of national drug control policy, fda, nih, and those in the research community who helped review and revise this list of synthetics as part of the legislative process. i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. house of representatives, committee on the judiciary, washington, dc, september 26, 2016. hon. fred upton, chairman, committee on energy and commerce, washington, dc. dear chairman upton: i write with respect to h.r. 3537, the ``synthetic drug control act of 2015,'' which was referred to the committee on energy and commerce and in addition to the committee on the judiciary. as a result of your having consulted with us on provisions within h.r. 3537 that fall within the rule x jurisdiction of the committee on the judiciary, i agree to discharge our committee from further consideration of this bill so that it may proceed expeditiously to the house floor for consideration. the judiciary committee takes this action with our mutual understanding that by foregoing consideration of h.r. 3537 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject matter contained in this or similar legislation and that our committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. our committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any house-senate conference involving this or similar legislation and asks that you support any such request. i would appreciate a response to this letter confirming this understanding with respect to h.r. 3537 and would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the congressional record during floor consideration of h.r. 3537. sincerely, bob goodlatte, chairman. ____ house of representatives, committee on energy and commerce, washington, dc, september 26, 2016. hon. bob goodlatte, chairman, committee on the judiciary, washington, dc. dear chairman goodlatte: thank you for your letter regarding h.r. 3537, the ``synthetic drug control act of 2015.'' as you noted, there are provisions of the bill that fall within the committee on the judiciary's rule x jurisdiction. i appreciate your willingness to forgo consideration of h.r. 3537, and i agree that your decision is not a waiver of any of the committee on the judiciary's jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and that the committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as this bill or similar legislation moves forward. in addition, i understand that the committee reserves the right to seek the appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any house-senate conference involving this or similar legislation, and you will have my support for any such request. i will include a copy of your letter and this response in the congressional record during floor consideration of h.r. 3537. sincerely, fred upton, chairman. mr. pallone. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. h.r. 3537, the dangerous synthetic drug control act, is bipartisan legislation sponsored by mr. dent of pennsylvania and also by congressman jim himes of connecticut. it is a targeted approach to addressing the latest threat from synthetic substances that is causing dangerous drug abuse across our communities, and i support its swift passage. sadly, stories of adults and teenagers abusing synthetic substances to get high have become all too common and have resulted in individuals either harming themselves or others. these drugs are extremely unsafe and can cause convulsions, anxiety attacks, hallucinations, psychotic episodes, and, in some instances, death. the rise of synthetic drug use is an issue we have been dealing with for many years now in my home state of new jersey. frightening increases in overdoses and deaths throughout the state from so-called designer drugs led new jersey to permanently ban synthetic marijuana in 2012. however, synthetic marijuana, commonly referred to as ``k2'' or ``spice,'' is still being sold illegally in my state and others and sends many to the emergency room every week. last year, according to data from the american association of poison control centers, new jersey logged 142 emergency calls, the ninth-most in the nation, for exposure to synthetic marijuana. despite the devastating impact of these substances, they are, unfortunately, not illegal and, as a result, are [[page h5873]] too readily available. under its current authority, the drug enforcement agency, or dea, has difficulty taking action against manufacturers of these substances. by swiftly engineering and reengineering these synthetic compounds, manufacturers have been able to avoid regulation under the controlled substances act. h.r. 3537 would schedule a narrow list of 22 synthetic substances, including 11 used to create synthetic marijuana, and three derivatives of fentanyl--a synthetic opioid that is more powerful than morphine. this targeted legislation was developed with input from the dea, the department of health and human services, the national institute on drug abuse, and the office of national drug control policy to ensure that these substances with known abuse potential have no therapeutic value and, therefore, should be appropriately moved to schedule i. i believe that this legislation will enable the dea to take needed enforcement actions against manufacturers of these dangerous substances. while the bill does not address the broader concerns that have been raised related to access to schedule i substances for research purposes, i am committed to continuing to work with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, as well as the administration, and stakeholders to find ways we can streamline the registration process for legitimate research purposes. i urge my colleagues to support h.r. 3537. i thank, again, congressman himes, and i look forward to continue to work with my colleagues to reduce the availability of dangerous synthetic substances. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. guthrie. mr. speaker, i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. dent). mr. dent. mr. speaker, i would like to thank chairman upton; ranking member pallone; messrs. guthrie, katko, and himes; eleanor holmes norton; and congressman jolly, all for helping to bring this bipartisan bill up today in order to officially identify these dangerous synthetic substances and address the public health crisis presented by their continued proliferation throughout the country. i have been working for several years to bring attention to the very serious threat that synthetic drugs pose to the health and safety of communities both within pennsylvania and across our nation. although initially successful after placing a number of synthetic cannabinoids on schedule i and enhancing the dea's authorities to protect the public from these drugs through legislation that was signed into law in 2012, we have begun to see a renewed rise in both the number of new substances on the streets and the number of victims affected by these products. this bill simply adds 22 compounds to schedule i of the controlled substances act, and these are, frankly, the very worst of the worst compounds out there. the products targeted by this bill are primarily labeled as synthetic marijuana, bath salts, or synthetic opioids, which are sold under the labels like k2, spice, and flakka that allow them to be marketed to unsuspecting young people and some of the most vulnerable members of our society. through modifications to the chemical formulas of these drugs, their overseas manufacturers have been able to continue to push them on to victims under the false impression that they are safe, despite often being even more potent than the drugs they are designed to mimic. without action--like the step we are taking here today to pass this critical bill and designate these substances as the dangerous and abusive products that they are--we will continue to see more overdoses, more victims, and, sadly, more deaths. just this month, there was a gruesome killing in my district that was fueled by the ingestion of the synthetic drug known as flakka-- absolutely gruesome. my friend, congressman himes, can talk about a situation very close to him, too, where there was a tragedy. unfortunately, data from our health centers, law enforcement entities, and poison control offices show that such cases have become more and more prevalent around the country, and i applaud this proactive action to stop further proliferation. i should note that when we passed a law in 2012, we did shut down so much of these synthetic drugs that were being sold. we shut it down. but these folks overseas have figured out ways to reformulate these compounds, and this problem is back with us today again. we had shut it down. it is back with us, and this is a step that we are taking. so, again, i would also like to thank all of these bipartisan cosponsors for their partnership in this effort and their commitment to work together to address this public health epidemic by getting these dangerous substances off the streets. finally, i would like to mention one other thing, too--that this bill has gone through an extensive regular order process. there has been a hearing, subcommittee markup, and a full committee markup. the bill is the result of negotiations between the dea, researchers, and many others. organizations like the american hospital association, the american college of emergency room physicians, the fraternal order of police, the national association of convenience stores, and former special agents of the fbi all support and endorse this bill. so, finally, i urge my colleagues to support passage of this important legislation today so we can save lives. i will continue my efforts to educate the public about the dangers of these synthetic drugs and to protect our communities. mr. pallone. mr. speaker, i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from connecticut (mr. himes), the democratic sponsor of the bill. mr. himes. mr. speaker, i thank mr. pallone for yielding. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of the dangerous synthetic drug control act, which will reclassify 22 dangerous synthetic substances as schedule i substances subject to the control and enforcement associated with schedule i substances. mr. speaker, the community i represent, like every community represented in this chamber, has been visited by the tragedy of fatal drug overdoses. we know the statistics nationally--opioid deaths are in the 30,000 neighborhood. that is a tragedy around the country. the substances that we reclassify today include some of the fentanyl substances that are often associated with the most gruesome overdoses often mixed with heroin. my colleagues will remember that fentanyl is the drug actually responsible for the overdose death of the musician prince and, sadly, is pervasive through our communities. the synthetic drugs that are being scheduled today through this bill are particularly pernicious because they are marketed often in corner retail establishments and often in ways designed to appeal to young people in colored packages with names like k2 and spice, clearly targeting our youngest constituents. we are engaged, of course, in a cat-and-mouse game with the producers of these substances because as soon as a substance is scheduled, a chemist somewhere figures out a slight alteration to the formula in such a way that now they have a drug which is untested and unproven but mimics some of the effects of a scheduled drug; but we have no idea what the effects are, and all too often those effects can be devastating to the individual using them. {time} 1430 this bill, again, will take 22 of those dangerous substances and classify them into schedule i. this is going to make my community in southwestern connecticut safer, and it will make communities throughout this country safer. i really want to thank, in particular, congressman dent for his very hard work on this, and chairman upton and ranking member pallone for expediting this bill in a way that i know is going to make a very positive difference in our communities. mr. pallone. mr. speaker, i urge support for the legislation. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. guthrie. mr. speaker, i encourage the adoption of this bill. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. scott of virginia. mr. speaker, i rise in opposition to h.r. 3537, the so-called dangerous synthetic drug control act of 2016. [[page h5874]] the legislation would add 22 synthetic drugs to schedule i of the controlled substances act. while some of these drugs may be indeed dangerous to the public, we know very little about many of them and adding them to schedule i would seriously hinder research. furthermore, by adding these synthetic drugs to schedule i, the legislation would significantly expand the mandatory minimum found in title 21, section 841(b)(1)(c) of the u.s. code. if an individual is convicted of selling, distributing, or making one of these drugs, he would be subject to a 20 year mandatory minimum sentence if someone is seriously injured or dies from using these drugs. and it doesn't stop there. adding these synthetic drugs to schedule i would also subject this 20 year mandatory minimum to other individuals that may get wrapped up in a drug conspiracy, per title 21, section 846. technically, a girlfriend that takes a phone message or drives her drug dealer boyfriend to a drug deal for one of these synthetic drugs could be included in the boyfriend's drug conspiracy and be subject to the same 20 year mandatory minimum if someone is seriously injured or dies from using the drugs involved in the conspiracy. an individual who has intentionally sold, distributed, or manufactured these synthetic drugs, if they are indeed dangerous, should be held criminally responsible if someone is harmed or dies using them. however, i believe a judge, not congress, should be the one determining the sentence based on the individual facts and circumstances. for decades now, research and evidence has demonstrated that mandatory minimums are ineffective deterrents, waste the taxpayers' money, force judges to impose irrational sentences, and discriminate against minorities, particularly with regards to drug offenses. unfortunately, there are already too many mandatory minimums in the federal code. mr. speaker, many americans wonder how low level drug offenders get decades long sentences. it's because of bills like this that there are thousands of low level, non-violent, first time offenders serving decades behind bars. if we ever expect to do anything about that problem and actually address the drivers of mass incarceration generally, the first step we have to take is to stop passing new mandatory minimums or bills that expand existing mandatory minimums. the mandatory minimums in the code today did not get there all at once--they got there one at a time, each one part of a larger bill, which on balance might have been a good idea. therefore, the only way to stop passing new mandatory minimums is to stop passing bills that contain mandatory minimums. for these reasons, i urge my colleagues to vote no on h.r. 3537. mr. blumenauer. mr. speaker, today, i will vote against h.r. 3537. no doubt many of these substances are horrific, and none of us wants to see people abusing them. dea can act on these drugs, has a process to do it, and should start down that path immediately. however, if we are going to deal with schedule i, the first thing we should do is eliminate marijuana from schedule i, which enabled the failed policy of prohibition. political interference is what got us here in the first place, and we should fix it. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from kentucky (mr. guthrie) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 3537, as amended. the question was taken. the speaker pro tempore. in the opinion of the chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. mr. amash. mr. speaker, on that i demand the yeas and nays. the yeas and nays were ordered. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to clause 8 of rule xx, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________",21497

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 5883) to amend the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921, to clarify the duties relating to services furnished in connection with the buying or selling of livestock in commerce through online, video, or other electronic methods, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 5883 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Clarification of Treatment of Electronic Sales of Livestock Act of 2016''. SEC. 2. DEFINITION OF MARKET AGENCY. (a) In General.--Section 301(c) of the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921 (7 U.S.C. 201(c)) is amended-- (1) by striking ``; and'' at the end and inserting a period; and (2) by adding at the end the following: ``Beginning on the date of the enactment of the Clarification of Treatment of Electronic Sales of Livestock Act of 2016, such term includes any person who engages in the business of buying or selling livestock, on a commission or other fee basis, through the use of online, video, or other electronic methods when handling or providing the means to handle receivables or proceeds from such buying or selling, so long as such person's annual average of online, video, or electronic sales of livestock, on a commission or other fee basis, exceeds $250,000.''. (b) Technical Amendments.--Section 301 of the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921 (7 U.S.C. 201) is amended-- (1) in the matter preceding subsection (a), by striking ``When used in this Act--'' and inserting ``In this Act:''; (2) in subsection (a), by striking the semicolon at the end and inserting a period; and (3) in subsection (b)-- (A) by striking ``weighting'' and inserting ``weighing''; and (B) by striking the semicolon at the end and inserting a period. SEC. 3. METHODS TO TRANSFER FUNDS. Section 409(a) of the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921 (7 U.S.C. 228b(a)) is amended-- (1) in the first proviso, by striking ``shall wire transfer funds to the seller's account'' each place it appears and inserting ``shall transfer funds for the full amount of the purchase price to the account of the seller by wire, electronic funds transfer, or any other expeditious method determined appropriate by the Secretary''; and (2) in the second proviso, by striking ``or dealer shall wire transfer funds'' and inserting ``or dealer shall transfer funds for the full amount of the purchase price by wire, electronic funds transfer, or any other expeditious method determined appropriate by the Secretary''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Rouzer) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Peterson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina. General Leave Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from North Carolina? There was no objection. Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 5883, the Clarification of Treatment of Electronic Sales of Livestock Act of 2016. The bill before us today makes simple, targeted reforms to an outdated statute in order to make it compatible with new practices that have come about because of advances in technology. The Packers and Stockyards Act was enacted to protect buyers and sellers of livestock from unfair, deceptive, and discriminatory practices. However, the statute has not undergone a thorough revision since being enacted in 1921, resulting in various outdated requirements. To account for the current practices that businesses use to buy and sell livestock, H.R. 5883 makes clarifying modifications, ensuring that the protections of the Packers and Stockyards Act apply to those who buy and sell livestock online on a commission or other fee basis. The Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921 references only two forms of payment methods acceptable under the act's prompt payment requirements--checks and wire transfers. To update this provision, the bill adds electronic transfer of funds to the list of acceptable methods of payment and gives the Secretary the flexibility to approve other new methods of payment as deemed appropriate. These commonsense changes are supported by the vast majority of the livestock community--in fact, we know of no opposition--and were unanimously supported by my colleagues on the House Agriculture Committee. I urge my colleagues to support these important modifications with their vote for this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. [[Page H5875]] Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5883 makes a very narrow fix to help bring the Packers and Stockyards Act to the 21st century. The bill is the result of a thorough review of the act to identify areas for modernization. The committee worked with the industry to provide clarity in the law regarding certain practices related to online transactions in the livestock markets. H.R. 5883 passed the Agriculture Committee by voice vote and has the support of seven major agriculture organizations. Again, this is a very straightforward bill, providing for minor, technical changes to the Packers and Stockyards Act. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.'' I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I want to again urge all of my colleagues in this Chamber to support this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Rouzer) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5883, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [House] [Pages H5874-H5875] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CLARIFICATION OF TREATMENT OF ELECTRONIC SALES OF LIVESTOCK ACT OF 2016 Mr. ROUZER.

H.R. 5883 passed the Agriculture Committee by voice vote and has the support of seven major agriculture organizations. Again, this is a very straightforward bill, providing for minor, technical changes to the Packers and Stockyards Act. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.'' I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I want to again urge all of my colleagues in this Chamber to support this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Rouzer) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5883, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.

(a) in general.--section 301(c) of the packers and stockyards act, 1921 (7 u.s.c. 201(c)) is amended-- (1) by striking ``; and'' at the end and inserting a period; and (2) by adding at the end the following: ``beginning on the date of the enactment of the clarification of treatment of electronic sales of livestock act of 2016, such term includes any person who engages in the business of buying or selling livestock, on a commission or other fee basis, through the use of online, video, or other electronic methods when handling or providing the means to handle receivables or proceeds from such buying or selling, so long as such person's annual average of online, video, or electronic sales of livestock, on a commission or other fee basis, exceeds $250,000.''. (b) technical amendments.--section 301 of the packers and stockyards act, 1921 (7 u.s.c. 201) is amended-- (1) in the matter preceding subsection (a), by striking ``when used in this act--'' and inserting ``in this act:''; (2) in subsection (a), by striking the semicolon at the end and inserting a period; and (3) in subsection (b)-- (a) by striking ``weighting'' and inserting ``weighing''; and (b) by striking the semicolon at the end and inserting a period. sec. 3. methods to transfer funds. section 409(a) of the packers and stockyards act, 1921 (7 u.s.c. 228b(a)) is amended-- (1) in the first proviso, by striking ``shall wire transfer funds to the seller's account'' each place it appears and inserting ``shall transfer funds for the full amount of the purchase price to the account of the seller by wire, electronic funds transfer, or any other expeditious method determined appropriate by the secretary''; and (2) in the second proviso, by striking ``or dealer shall wire transfer funds'' and inserting ``or dealer shall transfer funds for the full amount of the purchase price by wire, electronic funds transfer, or any other expeditious method determined appropriate by the secretary''. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from north carolina (mr. rouzer) and the gentleman from minnesota (mr. peterson) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from north carolina. general leave mr. rouzer. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from north carolina? there was no objection. mr. rouzer. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i rise in support of h.r. 5883, the clarification of treatment of electronic sales of livestock act of 2016. the bill before us today makes simple, targeted reforms to an outdated statute in order to make it compatible with new practices that have come about because of advances in technology. the packers and stockyards act was enacted to protect buyers and sellers of livestock from unfair, deceptive, and discriminatory practices. however, the statute has not undergone a thorough revision since being enacted in 1921, resulting in various outdated requirements. to account for the current practices that businesses use to buy and sell livestock, h.r. 5883 makes clarifying modifications, ensuring that the protections of the packers and stockyards act apply to those who buy and sell livestock online on a commission or other fee basis. the packers and stockyards act of 1921 references only two forms of payment methods acceptable under the act's prompt payment requirements--checks and wire transfers. to update this provision, the bill adds electronic transfer of funds to the list of acceptable methods of payment and gives the secretary the flexibility to approve other new methods of payment as deemed appropriate. these commonsense changes are supported by the vast majority of the livestock community--in fact, we know of no opposition--and were unanimously supported by my colleagues on the house agriculture committee. i urge my colleagues to support these important modifications with their vote for this bill. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. [[page h5875]] mr. peterson. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, h.r. 5883 makes a very narrow fix to help bring the packers and stockyards act to the 21st century. the bill is the result of a thorough review of the act to identify areas for modernization. the committee worked with the industry to provide clarity in the law regarding certain practices related to online transactions in the livestock markets. h.r. 5883 passed the agriculture committee by voice vote and has the support of seven major agriculture organizations. again, this is a very straightforward bill, providing for minor, technical changes to the packers and stockyards act. i urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.'' i yield back the balance of my time. mr. rouzer. mr. speaker, i want to again urge all of my colleagues in this chamber to support this bill. i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from north carolina (mr. rouzer) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 5883, as amended. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",6414

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 5460) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to establish a review process to review applications for certain grants to purchase equipment or systems that do not meet or exceed any applicable national voluntary consensus standards, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 5460 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``First Responder Access to Innovative Technologies Act''. SEC. 2. APPROVAL OF CERTAIN EQUIPMENT. (a) In General.--Subsection (f) of section 2008 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 609) is amended-- (1) by striking ``If an applicant'' and inserting the following: ``(1) Application requirement.--If an applicant''; and (2) by adding at the end the following new paragraphs: ``(2) Review process.--The Administrator shall implement a uniform process for reviewing applications that, in accordance with paragraph (1), contain explanations to use grants provided under section 2003 or 2004 to purchase equipment or systems that do not meet or exceed any applicable national voluntary consensus standards developed under section 647 of the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 (6 U.S.C. 747). ``(3) Factors.--In carrying out the review process under paragraph (2), the Administrator shall consider the following: ``(A) Current or past use of proposed equipment or systems by Federal agencies or the Armed Forces. ``(B) The absence of a national voluntary consensus standard for such equipment or systems. ``(C) The existence of an international consensus standard for such equipment or systems, and whether such equipment or systems meets such standard. ``(D) The nature of the capability gap identified by the applicant and how such equipment or systems will address such gap. ``(E) The degree to which such equipment or systems will serve the needs of the applicant better than equipment or systems that meet or exceed existing consensus standards. ``(F) Any other factor determined appropriate by the Administrator.''.

(2) The capability gaps identified by applicants and the number of such requests granted or denied. (3) The processing time for the review of such requests. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Donovan) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. General Leave Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications, I rise in support of H.R. 5460, the First Responder Access to Innovative Technologies Act, which passed out of my subcommittee with bipartisan support on June 16 and was reported favorably by the Committee on Homeland Security earlier this month. With threats consistently evolving, it is reassuring to see new technology being developed to ensure the safety of our communities and first responders. {time} 1500 However, emerging technology is frequently developed faster than voluntary consensus standards can be implemented. Recipients of grants under FEMA's State Homeland Security Grant Program and the Urban Areas Security Initiative must procure equipment that meets these standards. Unfortunately, if emerging technology or equipment does not have a voluntary consensus standard and a grant recipient would like to use those funds to purchase such technology, FEMA does not have a uniform review process to consider applications for that equipment. This legislation requires FEMA to develop such a process for reviewing these requests. I want to thank the subcommittee's ranking member, Representative Payne, for introducing this commonsense bill. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of H.R. 5460 because it will ensure first responders have the ability to purchase equipment and emerging technology needed to effectively adapt to the current threat landscape. First responders in multiple jurisdictions in New York and New Jersey were recently called upon to respond to a series of improvised explosive devices. It is clear that the threat to our communities is not going away; and we, as Members of Congress, must ensure our first responders can easily access emerging technology without being hampered by unnecessary bureaucracy. I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 5460, the First Responder Access to Innovative Technologies Act. Mr. Speaker, a week ago, after we observed the fifteenth anniversary of the September 11 attacks this month, a disturbed man planted bombs in New York City, in Seaside Park, New Jersey, and in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Local law enforcement in my district ultimately apprehended the suspect, but not before a shootout injured two brave officers, Officer Hammer and Officer Padilla of the Linden Police Department. In our Nation's darkest hours, the bravest among us rush into situations everyone else tries to escape. Those heros need the best, most modern technology on the market to do their jobs better and safer. With the help of the private sector, we have made significant strides in developing first responder technology. Nevertheless, first responders cannot use their Homeland Security grant dollars to purchase the latest technology unless it meets or exceeds voluntary industry standards, which take years to develop. To ensure that our brave first responders have access to the most modern equipment, the First Responder Access to Innovative Technologies Act directs the Federal Emergency Management Agency to develop a transparent process to review requests to purchase equipment for which voluntary industry standards do not exist. H.R. 5460 has the support of the Securities Industry Association and was approved by the full committee by voice vote. Mr. Speaker, our first responders are our heros. Time and time again, they [[Page H5880]] put themselves in harm's way to protect their communities. The First Responder Access to Innovative Technologies Act will ensure that our first responders have the technology they need to keep themselves safe as they keep us safe. I want to thank Subcommittee Chairman Donovan for his support of this measure. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5460. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5460. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Byrne).

there was no objection. mr. donovan. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. as chairman of the subcommittee on emergency preparedness, response, and communications, i rise in support of h.r. 5460, the first responder access to innovative technologies act, which passed out of my subcommittee with bipartisan support on june 16 and was reported favorably by the committee on homeland security earlier this month. with threats consistently evolving, it is reassuring to see new technology being developed to ensure the safety of our communities and first responders. {time} 1500 however, emerging technology is frequently developed faster than voluntary consensus standards can be implemented. recipients of grants under fema's state homeland security grant program and the urban areas security initiative must procure equipment that meets these standards. unfortunately, if emerging technology or equipment does not have a voluntary consensus standard and a grant recipient would like to use those funds to purchase such technology, fema does not have a uniform review process to consider applications for that equipment. this legislation requires fema to develop such a process for reviewing these requests. i want to thank the subcommittee's ranking member, representative payne, for introducing this commonsense bill. i am proud to be an original cosponsor of h.r. 5460 because it will ensure first responders have the ability to purchase equipment and emerging technology needed to effectively adapt to the current threat landscape. first responders in multiple jurisdictions in new york and new jersey were recently called upon to respond to a series of improvised explosive devices. it is clear that the threat to our communities is not going away; and we, as members of congress, must ensure our first responders can easily access emerging technology without being hampered by unnecessary bureaucracy. i urge all members to join me in supporting this bill. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. payne. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i rise in support of h.r. 5460, the first responder access to innovative technologies act. mr. speaker, a week ago, after we observed the fifteenth anniversary of the september 11 attacks this month, a disturbed man planted bombs in new york city, in seaside park, new jersey, and in elizabeth, new jersey. local law enforcement in my district ultimately apprehended the suspect, but not before a shootout injured two brave officers, officer hammer and officer padilla of the linden police department. in our nation's darkest hours, the bravest among us rush into situations everyone else tries to escape. those heros need the best, most modern technology on the market to do their jobs better and safer. with the help of the private sector, we have made significant strides in developing first responder technology. nevertheless, first responders cannot use their homeland security grant dollars to purchase the latest technology unless it meets or exceeds voluntary industry standards, which take years to develop. to ensure that our brave first responders have access to the most modern equipment, the first responder access to innovative technologies act directs the federal emergency management agency to develop a transparent process to review requests to purchase equipment for which voluntary industry standards do not exist. h.r. 5460 has the support of the securities industry association and was approved by the full committee by voice vote. mr. speaker, our first responders are our heros. time and time again, they [[page h5880]] put themselves in harm's way to protect their communities. the first responder access to innovative technologies act will ensure that our first responders have the technology they need to keep themselves safe as they keep us safe. i want to thank subcommittee chairman donovan for his support of this measure. i urge my colleagues to support h.r. 5460. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. donovan. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i once again urge my colleagues to support h.r. 5460. i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore (mr. byrne). the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from new york (mr. donovan) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 5460, as amended. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",8493

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 5943) to amend the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 to clarify certain allowable uses of funds for public transportation security assistance grants and establish periods of performance for such grants, and for other purposes, as amended.

The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 5943 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Transit Security Grant Program Flexibility Act''. SEC. 2. ALLOWABLE USES OF FUNDS FOR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ASSISTANCE GRANTS.

Section 1406 of the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/ 11 Commission Act of 2007 (6 U.S.C. 1135; Public Law 110-53) is amended-- (1) by redesignating subsection (m) as subsection (n); and (2) by inserting after subsection (l) the following new subsection: ``(m) Periods of Performance.-- ``(1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), funds provided pursuant to a grant awarded under this section for a use specified in subsection (b) shall remain available for use by a grant recipient for a period of not fewer than 36 months. ``(2) Exception.--Funds provided pursuant to a grant awarded under this section for a use specified in subparagraph (M) or (N) of subsection (b)(1) shall remain available for use by a grant recipient for a period of not fewer than 55 months.''. SEC. 4. GAO REVIEW. (a) In General.--The Comptroller General of the United States shall conduct a review of the transit security grant program under section 1406 of the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (6 U.S.C. 1135; Public Law 110-53). (b) Scope.--The review required under paragraph (1) shall include the following: (1) An assessment of the type of projects funded under the transit security grant program. (2) An assessment of the manner in which such projects address threats to transportation infrastructure. (3) An assessment of the impact, if any, of this Act (including the amendments made by this Act) on types of projects funded under the transit security grant program. (4) An assessment of the management and administration of transit security grant program funds by grantees. (5) Recommendations to improve the manner in which transit security grant program funds address vulnerabilities in transportation infrastructure. (6) Recommendations to improve the management and administration of the transit security grant program. (c) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of this Act and again not later than five years after such date of enactment, the Comptroller General shall submit to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate a report on the review required under this section. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Donovan) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. General Leave Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. We know that terrorists have an interest in and a track record of targeting mass transit. We saw it in London, Madrid, and Brussels, and recently, again, when a terrorist left a backpack of IEDs at a train station in Elizabeth, New Jersey. We must ensure that our first responders and transit agencies have the tools they need to secure our transit systems. That is why I introduced H.R. 5943, the Transit Security Grant Program Flexibility Act. This bill addresses concerns that were raised during a June 21 field hearing that the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications held in Ranking Member Payne's district on preparedness for incidents that impact surface transportation. As chairman of the subcommittee, I introduced this legislation to ensure action follows our subcommittee's oversight. Witnesses at this field hearing testified about the importance of the Transit Security Grant Program but found that the period of performance was a challenging time frame to meet, especially for completing vital, large-scale capital security projects. H.R. 5943 addresses this challenge by codifying the period of performance for Transit Security Grant Program awards at 36 months for the majority of eligible projects and by extending the period of performance for large-scale capital security projects to 55 months. Additionally, Transit Security Grant Program awards can be used to provide personnel with security training. Unfortunately, the recipients of these awards are not allowed to use Transit Security Grant Program funds to pay for backfilling personnel who attend such training. In some cases, that extra cost at the transit agency has resulted in an inability to send staff for security training. My bill will permit Transit Security Grant Program funds to be used for this purpose, which is consistent with other Homeland Security grant programs. With more than 10 billion riders using surface transportation annually, it is vital that the Transit Security Grant Program provide flexible solutions for grant recipients. I am proud to sponsor this bipartisan legislation, which passed out of the Committee on Homeland Security earlier this month. I urge all Members to join me in supporting H.R. 5943. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 5943, the Transit Security Grant Program Flexibility Act.

The subcommittee heard from Amtrak, New Jersey Transit, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and MTA about what they are doing to keep passengers safe and how the Federal Government can help. Witnesses lamented the drastic reduction in Transit Security Grant funding from upwards of $385 million in 2008 to only $100 million in 2016. Unfortunately, in the current fiscal environment, prospects for restoring this critical funding are not great. Witnesses also testified that the 36-month period of performance limits the ability of transit owners to invest in important security-hardening projects that cannot be completed within that window of time. Fortunately, we can address that problem. H.R. 5943 is a bipartisan bill that would extend the period of performance for transit grant activities that are related to infrastructure hardening to 55 months and would give grantees the flexibility to use the grant money for expenses that are related to covering the costs of staffing backfill for when responders are sent to security training. The threats to our transit infrastructure are real, Mr. Speaker. Two weeks ago, we had a close call outside a train station in Elizabeth, New Jersey, when a backpack containing a bomb was discovered by two citizens. Fortunately, they notified law enforcement; and although there was an explosion, no one was injured. Police found four other devices in the vicinity. H.R. 5943 will help transit owners and operators better address the threats to our critical transportation systems. As such, I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. [[Page H5879]] Mr. PAYNE.

there was no objection. mr. donovan. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. we know that terrorists have an interest in and a track record of targeting mass transit. we saw it in london, madrid, and brussels, and recently, again, when a terrorist left a backpack of ieds at a train station in elizabeth, new jersey. we must ensure that our first responders and transit agencies have the tools they need to secure our transit systems. that is why i introduced h.r. 5943, the transit security grant program flexibility act. this bill addresses concerns that were raised during a june 21 field hearing that the subcommittee on emergency preparedness, response, and communications held in ranking member payne's district on preparedness for incidents that impact surface transportation. as chairman of the subcommittee, i introduced this legislation to ensure action follows our subcommittee's oversight. witnesses at this field hearing testified about the importance of the transit security grant program but found that the period of performance was a challenging time frame to meet, especially for completing vital, large-scale capital security projects. h.r. 5943 addresses this challenge by codifying the period of performance for transit security grant program awards at 36 months for the majority of eligible projects and by extending the period of performance for large-scale capital security projects to 55 months. additionally, transit security grant program awards can be used to provide personnel with security training. unfortunately, the recipients of these awards are not allowed to use transit security grant program funds to pay for backfilling personnel who attend such training. in some cases, that extra cost at the transit agency has resulted in an inability to send staff for security training. my bill will permit transit security grant program funds to be used for this purpose, which is consistent with other homeland security grant programs. with more than 10 billion riders using surface transportation annually, it is vital that the transit security grant program provide flexible solutions for grant recipients. i am proud to sponsor this bipartisan legislation, which passed out of the committee on homeland security earlier this month. i urge all members to join me in supporting h.r. 5943. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. payne. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i rise in support of h.r. 5943, the transit security grant program flexibility act. following the march 2016 attacks on mass transit facilities in brussels, the committee on homeland security's emergency preparedness, response, and communications subcommittee held a hearing in my district at new jersey city university to learn more about efforts to secure mass transit domestically. the subcommittee heard from amtrak, new jersey transit, the port authority of new york and new jersey, and mta about what they are doing to keep passengers safe and how the federal government can help. witnesses lamented the drastic reduction in transit security grant funding from upwards of $385 million in 2008 to only $100 million in 2016. unfortunately, in the current fiscal environment, prospects for restoring this critical funding are not great. witnesses also testified that the 36-month period of performance limits the ability of transit owners to invest in important security-hardening projects that cannot be completed within that window of time. fortunately, we can address that problem. h.r. 5943 is a bipartisan bill that would extend the period of performance for transit grant activities that are related to infrastructure hardening to 55 months and would give grantees the flexibility to use the grant money for expenses that are related to covering the costs of staffing backfill for when responders are sent to security training. the threats to our transit infrastructure are real, mr. speaker. two weeks ago, we had a close call outside a train station in elizabeth, new jersey, when a backpack containing a bomb was discovered by two citizens. fortunately, they notified law enforcement; and although there was an explosion, no one was injured. police found four other devices in the vicinity. h.r. 5943 will help transit owners and operators better address the threats to our critical transportation systems. as such, i strongly encourage my colleagues to support this legislation. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. donovan. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. [[page h5879]] mr. payne. mr. speaker, h.r. 5943 was unanimously approved by the committee on homeland security on september 13. it recognizes that transit security grant program grantees can spend their money better and smarter when they have the time necessary to do so. i congratulate my colleague, mr. donovan, on this legislation, and i urge all of my colleagues to support h.r. 5943. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. donovan. mr. speaker, once again, i urge my colleagues to support h.r. 5943. i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from new york (mr. donovan) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 5943, as amended. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",9512

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, September is National Preparedness Month, and as chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security's Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications, I think it is fitting that we are here today to consider a number of bills that will enhance our homeland security, including legislation I introduced, H.R. 5459, the Cyber Preparedness Act of 2016. Cybersecurity is a major national security issue, and the threat is real and immediate. For instance, a cyber attack causing widespread power outages could have major cascading consequences on public health and safety; however, it appears that the Nation is not adequately prepared to prevent and respond to cyber attacks. Since 2012, FEMA has released an annual National Preparedness Report, which highlights States' progress in meeting 32 core capabilities as defined by the National Preparedness Goal. Each year, States have ranked their cybersecurity capabilities as one of their lowest. In May, my subcommittee, the Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications Subcommittee, held a joint hearing with the Homeland Security Committee's Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection, and Security Technologies to look at the current state of cyber preparedness and how the Federal Government can help the States address some of the challenges that they face. Witnesses explained that, while great progress has been made in enhancing their cybersecurity capabilities, challenges still remain, especially with regard to information sharing of cyber threats and risks and whether Homeland Security grants may be used for cybersecurity enhancements. I introduced H.R. 5459, the Cyber Preparedness Act of 2016, to address a number of findings from this hearing. My legislation addresses these findings by enhancing cyber risk information sharing with State and major urban area fusion centers; authorizing representatives from State and urban area fusion centers to be assigned to the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center, and permitting the NCCIC personnel to be deployed to fusion centers; sharing information on cyber preparedness best practices with State and local stakeholders; clarifying the eligibility of [[Page H5881]] State Homeland Security Grant Program and Urban Areas Security Initiative funding for cybersecurity enhancements; and working to combat the overclassification of cyber risk information so that it can be shared more broadly with stakeholders with a need to know. I appreciate that Chairmen McCaul and Ratcliffe and Ranking Member Payne have joined me as original cosponsors of H.R. 5459. This bipartisan legislation was reported favorably by the Committee on Homeland Security earlier this month. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bipartisan bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 5459, the Cyber Preparedness Act of 2016. Mr. Speaker, in May the Committee on Homeland Security held a hearing to examine how the Department of Homeland Security assists States in preparing and responding to cyber attacks. Historically, States have rated cybersecurity among the core capabilities in which they have the least confidence. At the hearing, we heard compelling testimony from State emergency managers and chief information officers about the initiatives States are undertaking to reverse that trend and prevent cyber attacks within their State. For instance, some States like New Jersey and California have begun developing their own cyber information-sharing capabilities akin to DHS' National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center. One of the consistent challenges witnesses identified, however, was the lack of robust cyber information sharing. H.R. 5459 addresses this challenge by promoting the sharing of cyber threat indicators and information, as well as cybersecurity best practices, with State and major urban area fusion centers. The bill also designates cybersecurity as an allowable use of State Homeland Security Grants and Urban Areas Security Initiative funds. Mr. Speaker, cyber attacks on systems that underpin the operation of critical infrastructure have the potential to wreak havoc on our communities. State emergency managers and chief information officers have made clear that the better sharing of cyber information is essential to preventing cyber attacks. H.R. 5459 seeks to improve cyber information sharing with fusion centers. Moreover, I would note that, with respect to cyber threats to election equipment, the committee adopted an amendment to specifically direct DHS to share cyber threat information regarding election equipment and technology with fusion centers. The right to vote is among the most cherished, and the integrity of our election process is fundamental to our democracy. We must protect it. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5459. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5459. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Donovan) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5459, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.

It is the sense of Congress that to facilitate the timely dissemination to appropriate State, local, and private sector stakeholders of homeland security information related to cyber threats, the Secretary of Homeland Security should, to the greatest extent practicable, work to share actionable information related to cyber threats in an unclassified form. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Donovan) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. General Leave Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, September is National Preparedness Month, and as chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security's Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications, I think it is fitting that we are here today to consider a number of bills that will enhance our homeland security, including legislation I introduced, H.R. 5459, the Cyber Preparedness Act of 2016. Cybersecurity is a major national security issue, and the threat is real and immediate. For instance, a cyber attack causing widespread power outages could have major cascading consequences on public health and safety; however, it appears that the Nation is not adequately prepared to prevent and respond to cyber attacks. Since 2012, FEMA has released an annual National Preparedness Report, which highlights States' progress in meeting 32 core capabilities as defined by the National Preparedness Goal. Each year, States have ranked their cybersecurity capabilities as one of their lowest. In May, my subcommittee, the Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications Subcommittee, held a joint hearing with the Homeland Security Committee's Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection, and Security Technologies to look at the current state of cyber preparedness and how the Federal Government can help the States address some of the challenges that they face. Witnesses explained that, while great progress has been made in enhancing their cybersecurity capabilities, challenges still remain, especially with regard to information sharing of cyber threats and risks and whether Homeland Security grants may be used for cybersecurity enhancements. I introduced H.R. 5459, the Cyber Preparedness Act of 2016, to address a number of findings from this hearing. My legislation addresses these findings by enhancing cyber risk information sharing with State and major urban area fusion centers; authorizing representatives from State and urban area fusion centers to be assigned to the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center, and permitting the NCCIC personnel to be deployed to fusion centers; sharing information on cyber preparedness best practices with State and local stakeholders; clarifying the eligibility of [[Page H5881]] State Homeland Security Grant Program and Urban Areas Security Initiative funding for cybersecurity enhancements; and working to combat the overclassification of cyber risk information so that it can be shared more broadly with stakeholders with a need to know. I appreciate that Chairmen McCaul and Ratcliffe and Ranking Member Payne have joined me as original cosponsors of H.R. 5459. This bipartisan legislation was reported favorably by the Committee on Homeland Security earlier this month. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bipartisan bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 5459, the Cyber Preparedness Act of 2016. Mr. Speaker, in May the Committee on Homeland Security held a hearing to examine how the Department of Homeland Security assists States in preparing and responding to cyber attacks. Historically, States have rated cybersecurity among the core capabilities in which they have the least confidence. At the hearing, we heard compelling testimony from State emergency managers and chief information officers about the initiatives States are undertaking to reverse that trend and prevent cyber attacks within their State. For instance, some States like New Jersey and California have begun developing their own cyber information-sharing capabilities akin to DHS' National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center. One of the consistent challenges witnesses identified, however, was the lack of robust cyber information sharing. H.R. 5459 addresses this challenge by promoting the sharing of cyber threat indicators and information, as well as cybersecurity best practices, with State and major urban area fusion centers. The bill also designates cybersecurity as an allowable use of State Homeland Security Grants and Urban Areas Security Initiative funds. Mr. Speaker, cyber attacks on systems that underpin the operation of critical infrastructure have the potential to wreak havoc on our communities. State emergency managers and chief information officers have made clear that the better sharing of cyber information is essential to preventing cyber attacks. H.R. 5459 seeks to improve cyber information sharing with fusion centers. Moreover, I would note that, with respect to cyber threats to election equipment, the committee adopted an amendment to specifically direct DHS to share cyber threat information regarding election equipment and technology with fusion centers. The right to vote is among the most cherished, and the integrity of our election process is fundamental to our democracy. We must protect it. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5459. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5459. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Donovan) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5459, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_204.csv,10991,10991,11063,"[congressional record volume 162, number 145 (monday, september 26, 2016)] [house] [pages h5880-h5881] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] cyber preparedness act of 2016 mr. donovan. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 5459) to amend the homeland security act of 2002 to enhance preparedness and response capabilities for cyber attacks, bolster the dissemination of homeland security information related to cyber threats, and for other purposes, as amended. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 5459 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``cyber preparedness act of 2016''. sec. 2. information sharing. title ii of the homeland security act of 2002 is amended-- (1) in section 210a (6 u.s.c. 124h)-- (a) in subsection (b)-- (i) in paragraph (10), by inserting before the semicolon at the end the following: ``, including, in coordination with the national cybersecurity and communications integration center under section 227, accessing timely technical assistance, risk management support, and incident response capabilities with respect to cyber threat indicators, defensive measures, cybersecurity risks, and incidents (as such terms are defined in such section), which may include attribution, mitigation, and remediation, and the provision of information and recommendations on security and resilience, including implications of cybersecurity risks to equipment and technology related to the electoral process'';

GENERAL LEAVE Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3779, Social Security Fraud Prevention Act of 2016. This was introduced by the gentleman from California (Mr. Valadao). Social Security numbers were first created for the sole purpose of allowing the Federal Government to track the earnings history of individuals to determine Social Security benefits. However, over the course of time, both the Federal Government and the private sector found these numbers to be valuable tools to keep track of individuals for a wide variety of reasons, including tax reporting and credit history. You can name how many different things where they require your Social Security number in order to figure out and identify who you are. {time} 1530 Because of these changes, Social Security numbers have become incredibly important in today's high-tech society. In fact, they can be used for a good deal of purposes in a positive way, but they can also be used in a nefarious way to try to create a fictitious identification for somebody. They are necessary for applying to college, getting a credit card, or opening a bank account. However, in the hands of the wrong people, Social Security numbers can lead to identity theft, something that is very destructive to those affected. Troublingly, the sponsor of this bill, Mr. Valadao, reported an interaction with one of his constituents who received a government document with a Social Security number printed on the outside of the envelope. It was on the outside of the envelope. Mr. Speaker, this is totally and completely unacceptable. Given the dangers associated with identity theft, the Federal Government must do more to safeguard Social Security numbers. Indeed, 2 weeks ago, my committee released a 231-page report detailing the majority staff's investigative findings concerning a data breach of personally identifiable information by the United States Office of Personnel Management. Mr. Speaker, this information included the Social Security numbers of more than 20 million Americans. As a result, an Oversight and Government Reform Committee report recommended Federal agencies reduce the use of Social Security numbers in order to mitigate the risk of identity theft. What the bill does that Mr. Valadao has introduced, H.R. 3779, is bring us closer to this goal by requiring Federal agencies to limit the sending of Social Security numbers via mail and to completely ban sending Social Security numbers in a way in which they can be seen on the outside of any package. Ultimately, this bill will protect Americans from having their Social Security numbers needlessly revealed by the Federal Government. [[Page H5884]] Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3779, the Social Security Fraud Prevention Act of 2016, as amended. As my colleague, the gentleman from Utah, has noted, this bipartisan legislation has been introduced by Representative David Valadao and cosponsored by Mr. Swalwell, both from California. This bill would strengthen efforts to prevent identity theft. In particular, it would prohibit Federal agencies from including the Social Security number of any individual on documents sent in the U.S. mail, unless an agency head determines that it is absolutely necessary to do so. Also, through regulations, agencies would, in the future, specify the precise circumstances under which they would need to include Social Security numbers in printed and mailed documents inside the envelope. This bill would also require agencies to partially redact Social Security numbers, where feasible, and restrict the visibility of Social Security numbers on the outside of any package sent by mail. As reported by the Department of Justice, nearly 18 million Americans are victims of identity theft per year. According to the 2016 Identity Fraud Study conducted by the Javelin Strategy & Research firm, identity theft has resulted in losses exceeding $112 billion over the last 6 years alone. That amounts to $35,600 stolen per minute over the last 6 years. The Javelin study also indicates that, as the U.S. continues to convert to chip-enabled credit card technology, identity thieves have become increasingly reliant on the creation of fraudulent customer accounts. This illicit practice is greatly enabled by the accessibility and exposure of Social Security numbers. Moreover, the announcement last week by Yahoo that the account information of at least 500 million users had been stolen by hackers back in 2014 is the latest example of the massive data breaches that we are continuing to experience in both the private and public sectors. In light of the complexity and frequency of these cyber attacks, it is imperative that we take commonsense steps at the Federal level to protect personally identifiable information, including Social Security numbers, against misuse. During our committee's investigation, as the chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, the gentleman from Utah, has noted, of the critical breaches of information technology systems at the Office of Personnel Management in 2015, we discovered that the agency had not encrypted the Social Security numbers of over 20 million employees. We are similarly behind the curve when it comes to safeguarding Social Security information sent by Federal agencies in the mail. Mr. Speaker, the Social Security Fraud Prevention Act is a practical piece of legislation that enjoys support on both sides of the aisle. It has also received strong endorsements from organizations such as the American Association of Retired Persons, or AARP, and the National Retiree Legislative Network. Publicly, I want to thank Mr. Valadao and Mr. Swalwell for their leadership in this issue. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis), of the 13th Congressional District. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I, too, would like to agree with my colleagues and recognize our colleague from California (Mr. Valadao), for being the sponsor of this piece of legislation, which obviously enjoys bipartisan support. I am a cosponsor of this bill. According to the Justice Department, identity theft affects nearly 18 million people, costing more than $15 billion in 2014 alone. This represents roughly 7 percent of all Americans age 16 or older. In Illinois alone, in 2014, it has been recognized that the FTC saw a 65 percent increase in identity theft. Data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics also shows us that women are more likely to be victims of identity theft than men. In addition, more than 14 percent of the victims are elderly. We all know that Social Security numbers are the link to a key piece of information that criminals use to steal people's identities. So this legislation takes an important step to ensure that our Federal agencies, our government, funded by the hardworking taxpayers of this country, are not making this problem even worse. This is a commonsense step. This is a commonsense piece of legislation that many out there watching may look to us and say: Do you mean this isn't already the law? Do you mean we are still allowing agencies to send Social Security numbers? We should have known this long ago. We should have stopped this long ago. But it is commonsense colleagues like Congressman Valadao and Congressman Swalwell, those fellow cosponsors, in a bipartisan way, Republicans and Democrats, who said: You know what? Let's solve this problem that should have been solved long ago. But now, we are going to get to it because of the leadership from Congressman Valadao. I am proud to cosponsor this legislation, which will have a real impact on reducing identity theft in this country. I want to commend each and every one of our colleagues who are supporting this measure. Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I know that the gentleman from California, the lead sponsor of this bill, has just arrived, and I want to publicly thank him, as well as the gentleman from Illinois who just spoke. I appreciate his leadership. He joined with Mr. Swalwell on our side of the aisle. And I agree, this is a long time coming. It should have been done years ago. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. Valadao), the prime sponsor of this bill. Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3779, the Social Security Fraud Prevention Act. This commonsense piece of legislation will help mitigate rising instances of identity theft, which have become a significant problem across our country. What is worse, these crimes tend to affect the populations that need protection the most, including the elderly, children, and veterans. Recovering from having your identity being stolen is a burdensome and expensive process. One way to reduce occurrences of this crime is to prevent the Federal Government from mailing documents that contain the full Social Security number of an American citizen, unless it is absolutely necessary. I realized the need for this legislation after I was approached by a constituent in my district who showed me a letter she received from the Social Security Administration that had her full Social Security number printed on it, as well as her full name and address. Upon further investigation, we found that the Social Security Administration was also printing full Social Security numbers visible on the outside of postcards. This is simply unacceptable. Social Security was established to provide older Americans financial security during their retirement years, not jeopardize their security by handling someone's personal information poorly. Even more concerning is that the problem is not exclusive to the Social Security Administration but has become a government-wide problem. My bill, H.R. 3779, would prevent the Federal Government from mailing documents that contain full Social Security numbers, unless absolutely necessary, and require the Federal agencies to partially redact Social Security numbers on documents, whenever possible. Additionally, the bill prevents Social Security numbers from ever being visible on the outside of a piece of mail. Please join me in supporting this commonsense piece of legislation that will help Americans avoid falling victim to one of the fastest growing crimes in the United States. [[Page H5885]] Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I want to thank and congratulate Mr. Valadao and others who have worked on this bill. It is a commonsense piece of legislation. I urge its adoption. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, I was privileged to introduce H.R. 3779, the Social Security Fraud Prevention Act, with my friend from California, Congressman Valadao. Identity theft is a major and growing problem in our nation. Almost 18 million Americans were victims of this crime in 2014, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Of those who lost money as a result of their victimization, the average loss was over $1,300. This is a serious, complicated problem from which no one is immune. As in most complex issues, there is not just one solution. We must attack it from a variety of angles. For example, the government certainly shouldn't be making identity theft more likely by making it easier for criminals to get people's Social Security Numbers. Puffing aside the merits, the reality is that Social Security Numbers right now are used in many ways to identify people and secure accounts. Having someone's Social Security Number thus can be very helpful in stealing someone's identity. H.R. 3779 would make it more difficult to steal someone's Social Security Number by prohibiting any federal agency or department from including it on documents sent by mail unless it is determined to be necessary. And, when it is included it would not be visible from the outside of the envelope and would be partially redacted when possible. This is a common sense, bipartisan bill that is one piece of a larger comprehensive effort we need to successfully combat identity theft. I thank Congressman Valadao for sponsoring it and working on it with me. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3779. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3779, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [House] [Pages H5883-H5885] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SOCIAL SECURITY FRAUD PREVENTION ACT OF 2016 Mr. CHAFFETZ.

Given the dangers associated with identity theft, the Federal Government must do more to safeguard Social Security numbers. Indeed, 2 weeks ago, my committee released a 231-page report detailing the majority staff's investigative findings concerning a data breach of personally identifiable information by the United States Office of Personnel Management. Mr. Speaker, this information included the Social Security numbers of more than 20 million Americans. As a result, an Oversight and Government Reform Committee report recommended Federal agencies reduce the use of Social Security numbers in order to mitigate the risk of identity theft. What the bill does that Mr. Valadao has introduced, H.R. 3779, is bring us closer to this goal by requiring Federal agencies to limit the sending of Social Security numbers via mail and to completely ban sending Social Security numbers in a way in which they can be seen on the outside of any package. Ultimately, this bill will protect Americans from having their Social Security numbers needlessly revealed by the Federal Government. [[Page H5884]] Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3779, the Social Security Fraud Prevention Act of 2016, as amended. As my colleague, the gentleman from Utah, has noted, this bipartisan legislation has been introduced by Representative David Valadao and cosponsored by Mr. Swalwell, both from California. This bill would strengthen efforts to prevent identity theft. In particular, it would prohibit Federal agencies from including the Social Security number of any individual on documents sent in the U.S. mail, unless an agency head determines that it is absolutely necessary to do so. Also, through regulations, agencies would, in the future, specify the precise circumstances under which they would need to include Social Security numbers in printed and mailed documents inside the envelope. This bill would also require agencies to partially redact Social Security numbers, where feasible, and restrict the visibility of Social Security numbers on the outside of any package sent by mail. As reported by the Department of Justice, nearly 18 million Americans are victims of identity theft per year. According to the 2016 Identity Fraud Study conducted by the Javelin Strategy & Research firm, identity theft has resulted in losses exceeding $112 billion over the last 6 years alone. That amounts to $35,600 stolen per minute over the last 6 years. The Javelin study also indicates that, as the U.S. continues to convert to chip-enabled credit card technology, identity thieves have become increasingly reliant on the creation of fraudulent customer accounts. This illicit practice is greatly enabled by the accessibility and exposure of Social Security numbers. Moreover, the announcement last week by Yahoo that the account information of at least 500 million users had been stolen by hackers back in 2014 is the latest example of the massive data breaches that we are continuing to experience in both the private and public sectors. In light of the complexity and frequency of these cyber attacks, it is imperative that we take commonsense steps at the Federal level to protect personally identifiable information, including Social Security numbers, against misuse. During our committee's investigation, as the chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, the gentleman from Utah, has noted, of the critical breaches of information technology systems at the Office of Personnel Management in 2015, we discovered that the agency had not encrypted the Social Security numbers of over 20 million employees. We are similarly behind the curve when it comes to safeguarding Social Security information sent by Federal agencies in the mail. Mr. Speaker, the Social Security Fraud Prevention Act is a practical piece of legislation that enjoys support on both sides of the aisle. It has also received strong endorsements from organizations such as the American Association of Retired Persons, or AARP, and the National Retiree Legislative Network. Publicly, I want to thank Mr. Valadao and Mr. Swalwell for their leadership in this issue. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis), of the 13th Congressional District. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I, too, would like to agree with my colleagues and recognize our colleague from California (Mr. Valadao), for being the sponsor of this piece of legislation, which obviously enjoys bipartisan support. I am a cosponsor of this bill. According to the Justice Department, identity theft affects nearly 18 million people, costing more than $15 billion in 2014 alone. This represents roughly 7 percent of all Americans age 16 or older. In Illinois alone, in 2014, it has been recognized that the FTC saw a 65 percent increase in identity theft. Data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics also shows us that women are more likely to be victims of identity theft than men. In addition, more than 14 percent of the victims are elderly. We all know that Social Security numbers are the link to a key piece of information that criminals use to steal people's identities. So this legislation takes an important step to ensure that our Federal agencies, our government, funded by the hardworking taxpayers of this country, are not making this problem even worse. This is a commonsense step. This is a commonsense piece of legislation that many out there watching may look to us and say: Do you mean this isn't already the law? Do you mean we are still allowing agencies to send Social Security numbers? We should have known this long ago. We should have stopped this long ago. But it is commonsense colleagues like Congressman Valadao and Congressman Swalwell, those fellow cosponsors, in a bipartisan way, Republicans and Democrats, who said: You know what? Let's solve this problem that should have been solved long ago. But now, we are going to get to it because of the leadership from Congressman Valadao. I am proud to cosponsor this legislation, which will have a real impact on reducing identity theft in this country. I want to commend each and every one of our colleagues who are supporting this measure. Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I know that the gentleman from California, the lead sponsor of this bill, has just arrived, and I want to publicly thank him, as well as the gentleman from Illinois who just spoke. I appreciate his leadership. He joined with Mr. Swalwell on our side of the aisle. And I agree, this is a long time coming. It should have been done years ago. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. Valadao), the prime sponsor of this bill. Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3779, the Social Security Fraud Prevention Act. This commonsense piece of legislation will help mitigate rising instances of identity theft, which have become a significant problem across our country. What is worse, these crimes tend to affect the populations that need protection the most, including the elderly, children, and veterans. Recovering from having your identity being stolen is a burdensome and expensive process. One way to reduce occurrences of this crime is to prevent the Federal Government from mailing documents that contain the full Social Security number of an American citizen, unless it is absolutely necessary. I realized the need for this legislation after I was approached by a constituent in my district who showed me a letter she received from the Social Security Administration that had her full Social Security number printed on it, as well as her full name and address. Upon further investigation, we found that the Social Security Administration was also printing full Social Security numbers visible on the outside of postcards. This is simply unacceptable. Social Security was established to provide older Americans financial security during their retirement years, not jeopardize their security by handling someone's personal information poorly. Even more concerning is that the problem is not exclusive to the Social Security Administration but has become a government-wide problem. My bill, H.R. 3779, would prevent the Federal Government from mailing documents that contain full Social Security numbers, unless absolutely necessary, and require the Federal agencies to partially redact Social Security numbers on documents, whenever possible. Additionally, the bill prevents Social Security numbers from ever being visible on the outside of a piece of mail. Please join me in supporting this commonsense piece of legislation that will help Americans avoid falling victim to one of the fastest growing crimes in the United States. [[Page H5885]] Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I want to thank and congratulate Mr. Valadao and others who have worked on this bill. It is a commonsense piece of legislation. I urge its adoption. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, I was privileged to introduce H.R. 3779, the Social Security Fraud Prevention Act, with my friend from California, Congressman Valadao. Identity theft is a major and growing problem in our nation. Almost 18 million Americans were victims of this crime in 2014, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Of those who lost money as a result of their victimization, the average loss was over $1,300. This is a serious, complicated problem from which no one is immune. As in most complex issues, there is not just one solution. We must attack it from a variety of angles. For example, the government certainly shouldn't be making identity theft more likely by making it easier for criminals to get people's Social Security Numbers. Puffing aside the merits, the reality is that Social Security Numbers right now are used in many ways to identify people and secure accounts. Having someone's Social Security Number thus can be very helpful in stealing someone's identity. H.R. 3779 would make it more difficult to steal someone's Social Security Number by prohibiting any federal agency or department from including it on documents sent by mail unless it is determined to be necessary. And, when it is included it would not be visible from the outside of the envelope and would be partially redacted when possible. This is a common sense, bipartisan bill that is one piece of a larger comprehensive effort we need to successfully combat identity theft. I thank Congressman Valadao for sponsoring it and working on it with me. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3779. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3779, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [House] [Pages H5883-H5885] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SOCIAL SECURITY FRAUD PREVENTION ACT OF 2016 Mr. CHAFFETZ.

GENERAL LEAVE Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3779, Social Security Fraud Prevention Act of 2016. This was introduced by the gentleman from California (Mr. Valadao). Social Security numbers were first created for the sole purpose of allowing the Federal Government to track the earnings history of individuals to determine Social Security benefits. However, over the course of time, both the Federal Government and the private sector found these numbers to be valuable tools to keep track of individuals for a wide variety of reasons, including tax reporting and credit history. You can name how many different things where they require your Social Security number in order to figure out and identify who you are. {time} 1530 Because of these changes, Social Security numbers have become incredibly important in today's high-tech society. In fact, they can be used for a good deal of purposes in a positive way, but they can also be used in a nefarious way to try to create a fictitious identification for somebody. They are necessary for applying to college, getting a credit card, or opening a bank account. However, in the hands of the wrong people, Social Security numbers can lead to identity theft, something that is very destructive to those affected. Troublingly, the sponsor of this bill, Mr. Valadao, reported an interaction with one of his constituents who received a government document with a Social Security number printed on the outside of the envelope. It was on the outside of the envelope. Mr. Speaker, this is totally and completely unacceptable.

let's solve this problem that should have been solved long ago. but now, we are going to get to it because of the leadership from congressman valadao. i am proud to cosponsor this legislation, which will have a real impact on reducing identity theft in this country. i want to commend each and every one of our colleagues who are supporting this measure. mr. lynch. mr. speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. mr. speaker, i know that the gentleman from california, the lead sponsor of this bill, has just arrived, and i want to publicly thank him, as well as the gentleman from illinois who just spoke. i appreciate his leadership. he joined with mr. swalwell on our side of the aisle. and i agree, this is a long time coming. it should have been done years ago. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. chaffetz. mr. speaker, i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from california (mr. valadao), the prime sponsor of this bill. mr. valadao. mr. speaker, i rise today in strong support of h.r. 3779, the social security fraud prevention act. this commonsense piece of legislation will help mitigate rising instances of identity theft, which have become a significant problem across our country. what is worse, these crimes tend to affect the populations that need protection the most, including the elderly, children, and veterans. recovering from having your identity being stolen is a burdensome and expensive process. one way to reduce occurrences of this crime is to prevent the federal government from mailing documents that contain the full social security number of an american citizen, unless it is absolutely necessary. i realized the need for this legislation after i was approached by a constituent in my district who showed me a letter she received from the social security administration that had her full social security number printed on it, as well as her full name and address. upon further investigation, we found that the social security administration was also printing full social security numbers visible on the outside of postcards. this is simply unacceptable. social security was established to provide older americans financial security during their retirement years, not jeopardize their security by handling someone's personal information poorly. even more concerning is that the problem is not exclusive to the social security administration but has become a government-wide problem. my bill, h.r. 3779, would prevent the federal government from mailing documents that contain full social security numbers, unless absolutely necessary, and require the federal agencies to partially redact social security numbers on documents, whenever possible. additionally, the bill prevents social security numbers from ever being visible on the outside of a piece of mail. please join me in supporting this commonsense piece of legislation that will help americans avoid falling victim to one of the fastest growing crimes in the united states. [[page h5885]] mr. chaffetz. mr. speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. i want to thank and congratulate mr. valadao and others who have worked on this bill. it is a commonsense piece of legislation. i urge its adoption. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. swalwell of california. mr. speaker, i was privileged to introduce h.r. 3779, the social security fraud prevention act, with my friend from california, congressman valadao. identity theft is a major and growing problem in our nation. almost 18 million americans were victims of this crime in 2014, according to the bureau of justice statistics. of those who lost money as a result of their victimization, the average loss was over $1,300. this is a serious, complicated problem from which no one is immune. as in most complex issues, there is not just one solution. we must attack it from a variety of angles. for example, the government certainly shouldn't be making identity theft more likely by making it easier for criminals to get people's social security numbers. puffing aside the merits, the reality is that social security numbers right now are used in many ways to identify people and secure accounts. having someone's social security number thus can be very helpful in stealing someone's identity. h.r. 3779 would make it more difficult to steal someone's social security number by prohibiting any federal agency or department from including it on documents sent by mail unless it is determined to be necessary. and, when it is included it would not be visible from the outside of the envelope and would be partially redacted when possible. this is a common sense, bipartisan bill that is one piece of a larger comprehensive effort we need to successfully combat identity theft. i thank congressman valadao for sponsoring it and working on it with me. i urge my colleagues to support h.r. 3779. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from utah (mr. chaffetz) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 3779, as amended. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",15407

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Rouzer) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Peterson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina. General Leave Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from North Carolina? There was no objection. Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 845, the National Forest System Trails Stewardship Act. In 2013, the Government Accountability Office released a report that recognized the importance of volunteers for trail maintenance and recommended taking steps to improve management of volunteers. The Forest Service is facing a whopping $500 million backlog in trail maintenance costs--$500 million. H.R. 845 would require the Forest Service to produce a national strategy to maximum use of volunteers and partners for trail maintenance. Using eager volunteers across the Nation in the remediation of our deteriorating national Forest Service trails is a cost-effective solution. More than 50 diverse recreation and conservation groups requested Congress act to enable volunteers to do more, from the Wilderness Society to the American Motorcyclist Association. I would like to thank my colleague, Representative Lummis, for sponsoring this bill, and my fellow committee members, Mr. Walz, Mr. Peterson, Mr. Thompson, and Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham, for their support of H.R. 845. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this bipartisan legislation so we can utilize on-the-ground volunteer efforts to improve Forest Service trails and decrease the costly trail maintenance backlog. Refocusing on volunteers and partners to help the Forest Service is a commonsense way of making progress on the backlog and opening up these trails to public access. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. House of Representatives, Committee on Natural Resources, Washington, DC, September 14, 2016. Hon. K. Michael Conaway, Chairman, Committee on Agriculture, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: I write concerning H.R. 845, National Forest System Trails Stewardship Act, which was recently ordered to be reported by the Committee on Agriculture. As you are aware, the bill also was referred to the Committee on Natural Resources, as the bill contains provisions within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Natural Resources Committee. In the interest of permitting you to proceed expeditiously to floor consideration of this very important bill, this Committee agrees to discharge from further consideration of H.R. 845. I do so with the understanding that the Natural Resources Committee does not waive any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matter contained in the bill which fall within its Rule X jurisdiction. I also request that you urge the Speaker to name members of the Natural Resources Committee to any conference committee to consider such provisions. Please place this letter into the committee report on H.R. 845 and into the Congressional Record during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank you for the cooperative spirit in which you and your staff have worked regarding this matter and others between our respective committees, and congratulations on this significant achievement. Sincerely, Rob Bishop, Chairman. ____ House of Representatives, Committee on Agriculture, Washington, DC, September 13, 2016. Hon. Rob Bishop, Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: I appreciate your support in bringing H.R. 845, National Forest System Trails Stewardship Act, before the House of Representatives, and accordingly, understand that the Committee on Natural Resources will forego action on the bill. The Committee on Agriculture concurs in the mutual understanding that by foregoing consideration of the bill at this time, the Committee on Natural Resources does not [[Page H5877]] waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this bill or similar legislation in the future. In addition, should a conference on this bill be necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee on Natural Resources represented on the conference committee. I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional Record during Floor consideration. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward to continuing to work the Committee on Natural Resources as this bill moves through the legislative process. Sincerely, K. Michael Conaway, Chairman. Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 845, the National Forest System Trails Stewardship Act, is a bipartisan bill introduced by Representative Walz, a member of the Agriculture Committee, and Representative Lummis, a former member of the Agriculture Committee. A 2013 GAO Trails Maintenance Report found that the Forest Service has a backlog of more than $314 million in trail maintenance, which would be addressed by this legislation. The bill requires that the Forest Service develop a national strategy to double the amount of maintenance work done by volunteers in the next 5 years, ensuring our constituents can continue to use and enjoy these public spaces. The Agriculture Committee approved H.R. 845 by voice vote, and the bill is supported by a wide range of government, recreation, agriculture, conservation, sportsmen, and equestrian organizations. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Mrs. Lummis). Mrs. LUMMIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Rouzer). I also want to thank my former committee chairman on the House Agriculture Committee, now the ranking member, Mr. Peterson, for his support of this bill, as well as Chairman Conaway of the House Agriculture Committee. Mr. Speaker, in the national forests, especially in areas where there have been bark beetle damage, the trees are starting to fall across the trails. I have talked to outfitters who are taking pack trips into the national forests. They are only in there for 2 or 3 days, and when they try to get out they have to chop their way out because so many trees have fallen across the trails, even while they are in the forest. So this maintenance backlog is getting bigger. Mr. Speaker, it makes such sense, practically speaking, when we have a huge budget deficit, to maximize the use of volunteers in the national forests to help maintain these trails. Now, they will be able to avail themselves of workers comp, and that is part of the reason that it has taken this bill such a long time to get to the floor. But it came out of the Agriculture Committee unanimously. It is one of the most bipartisan bills in this entire Congress. It has 86 cosponsors in the House and 23 in the Senate. I want to thank my colleague, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Walz), who is a cosponsor of this bill, for his work. I am hoping he will tell the tale that he encountered this summer when he was hiking in the West. More than 50 diverse recreation conservation groups wanted a way to increase volunteer efforts in our national forests, including the National Association of Counties. Mr. Speaker, there are a couple of additional provisions I want to highlight in this bill. It directs a study be done on utilizing fire crews for maintenance work during off seasons for wildfire, which is a great way for them to maximize, and for us to maximize, their skills in the forests. And it also requires the Secretary of Agriculture to identify 9 to 15 priority areas throughout the country to incorporate volunteers and to increase trail maintenance. This bill has broad support. It will produce opportunities for young people to volunteer in our forests. It will allow outfitters and guides to offset some of their permit fees through work on trail maintenance performed by the permit holders to construct, improve, or maintain National Forest System trails, trailheads, or developed sites under supervision of our National Park Service. This is kind of a motherhood and apple pie bill, Mr. Speaker, and it has been my pleasure to work with Mr. Walz and the other proponents of this bill to bring it to the floor this afternoon. {time} 1445 Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Walz), a cosponsor of the bill. Mr. WALZ. I thank the gentleman. I echo the statements made by the gentlewoman from Wyoming. First of all, the passion and the work that she and her staff have put into this is thanked by many millions of Americans who use these trails. The gentlewoman has chosen to make this her last session of Congress; so I would like to go on record and say that the people of the great State of Wyoming have been well served by the gentlewoman's passionate, ethical leadership and by her willingness to put the Nation's business first and get things done. I thank the gentlewoman. Mr. Speaker, this is a commonsense bill. The Nation's outdoor industry is a $645-billion-a-year industry which hires 6.1 million Americans. The great blessings that we have in this Nation of the most beautiful outdoor areas in the world are a legacy that we want to pass on. One of the issues is accessing those areas. Trail maintenance is absolutely critical. Listen to the groups of people who are behind this. These are pretty impressive and diverse groups of cosponsors, just to name a few: the National Association of Counties, the Wilderness Society, the Western Governors' Association, the Back Country Horsemen of America, Trout Unlimited, the American Motorcyclist Association, the National Wildlife Federation, and it goes on and on and on. The gentlewoman was referencing something that happened. This is a real-world fix to a real-world problem without its costing taxpayers money. I had the opportunity this summer to be out at Glacier National Park with my family and to be up on Going-to-the-Sun Road at Logan Pass and, I think, hiking one of the most beautiful stretches on the planet--the Highline Trail. We were out about 16 miles; it was midday; and I had my children, my nephew, and my brother-in-law. We were all there and were enjoying this when we saw two Park Service folks, two young men, over there, working really hard. They had packhorses to pack their stuff in, and they were shoring up a trail from the glaciers that was there. I just walked over to them, and they had no idea there were hikers on the trail. I said: I want to thank you both for the work you are doing. They said: If you really want to thank us, have your Congressman call and support Mrs. Lummis' bill on trail maintenance. I could not have been more shocked to expect that there, but they understood the importance of it. They understood that they need the help and that the volunteers are there under the guidance and the expertise of the Forest Service. When we cut through some of the red tape, we get people who care about the trails out there, and we fix the problem. I thank the gentlewoman and encourage the bill's support. Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Mrs. Lummis). Mrs. LUMMIS. I thank Mr. Rouzer for allowing me to do something I should have done, but Mr. Walz did it for me. That is to thank my staff, especially Jimmy Ward, for all of his hard work on this bill. He made sure that we continued to be moving this bill forward in his helping us to identify cosponsors and working with the scoring process, which is what brings us here today; so I want to say a particular thank you to my staff. Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Rouzer) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 845, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the [[Page H5878]] rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [House] [Pages H5875-H5878] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NATIONAL FOREST SYSTEM TRAILS STEWARDSHIP ACT Mr. ROUZER.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Rouzer) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Peterson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina. General Leave Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from North Carolina? There was no objection. Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 845, the National Forest System Trails Stewardship Act. In 2013, the Government Accountability Office released a report that recognized the importance of volunteers for trail maintenance and recommended taking steps to improve management of volunteers. The Forest Service is facing a whopping $500 million backlog in trail maintenance costs--$500 million. H.R. 845 would require the Forest Service to produce a national strategy to maximum use of volunteers and partners for trail maintenance. Using eager volunteers across the Nation in the remediation of our deteriorating national Forest Service trails is a cost-effective solution. More than 50 diverse recreation and conservation groups requested Congress act to enable volunteers to do more, from the Wilderness Society to the American Motorcyclist Association. I would like to thank my colleague, Representative Lummis, for sponsoring this bill, and my fellow committee members, Mr. Walz, Mr. Peterson, Mr. Thompson, and Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham, for their support of H.R. 845. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this bipartisan legislation so we can utilize on-the-ground volunteer efforts to improve Forest Service trails and decrease the costly trail maintenance backlog. Refocusing on volunteers and partners to help the Forest Service is a commonsense way of making progress on the backlog and opening up these trails to public access. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. House of Representatives, Committee on Natural Resources, Washington, DC, September 14, 2016. Hon. K. Michael Conaway, Chairman, Committee on Agriculture, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: I write concerning H.R. 845, National Forest System Trails Stewardship Act, which was recently ordered to be reported by the Committee on Agriculture. As you are aware, the bill also was referred to the Committee on Natural Resources, as the bill contains provisions within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Natural Resources Committee. In the interest of permitting you to proceed expeditiously to floor consideration of this very important bill, this Committee agrees to discharge from further consideration of H.R. 845. I do so with the understanding that the Natural Resources Committee does not waive any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matter contained in the bill which fall within its Rule X jurisdiction. I also request that you urge the Speaker to name members of the Natural Resources Committee to any conference committee to consider such provisions. Please place this letter into the committee report on H.R. 845 and into the Congressional Record during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank you for the cooperative spirit in which you and your staff have worked regarding this matter and others between our respective committees, and congratulations on this significant achievement. Sincerely, Rob Bishop, Chairman. ____ House of Representatives, Committee on Agriculture, Washington, DC, September 13, 2016. Hon. Rob Bishop, Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: I appreciate your support in bringing H.R. 845, National Forest System Trails Stewardship Act, before the House of Representatives, and accordingly, understand that the Committee on Natural Resources will forego action on the bill. The Committee on Agriculture concurs in the mutual understanding that by foregoing consideration of the bill at this time, the Committee on Natural Resources does not [[Page H5877]] waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this bill or similar legislation in the future. In addition, should a conference on this bill be necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee on Natural Resources represented on the conference committee. I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional Record during Floor consideration. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward to continuing to work the Committee on Natural Resources as this bill moves through the legislative process. Sincerely, K. Michael Conaway, Chairman. Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 845, the National Forest System Trails Stewardship Act, is a bipartisan bill introduced by Representative Walz, a member of the Agriculture Committee, and Representative Lummis, a former member of the Agriculture Committee. A 2013 GAO Trails Maintenance Report found that the Forest Service has a backlog of more than $314 million in trail maintenance, which would be addressed by this legislation. The bill requires that the Forest Service develop a national strategy to double the amount of maintenance work done by volunteers in the next 5 years, ensuring our constituents can continue to use and enjoy these public spaces. The Agriculture Committee approved H.R. 845 by voice vote, and the bill is supported by a wide range of government, recreation, agriculture, conservation, sportsmen, and equestrian organizations. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Mrs. Lummis). Mrs. LUMMIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Rouzer). I also want to thank my former committee chairman on the House Agriculture Committee, now the ranking member, Mr. Peterson, for his support of this bill, as well as Chairman Conaway of the House Agriculture Committee. Mr. Speaker, in the national forests, especially in areas where there have been bark beetle damage, the trees are starting to fall across the trails. I have talked to outfitters who are taking pack trips into the national forests. They are only in there for 2 or 3 days, and when they try to get out they have to chop their way out because so many trees have fallen across the trails, even while they are in the forest. So this maintenance backlog is getting bigger. Mr. Speaker, it makes such sense, practically speaking, when we have a huge budget deficit, to maximize the use of volunteers in the national forests to help maintain these trails. Now, they will be able to avail themselves of workers comp, and that is part of the reason that it has taken this bill such a long time to get to the floor. But it came out of the Agriculture Committee unanimously. It is one of the most bipartisan bills in this entire Congress. It has 86 cosponsors in the House and 23 in the Senate. I want to thank my colleague, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Walz), who is a cosponsor of this bill, for his work. I am hoping he will tell the tale that he encountered this summer when he was hiking in the West. More than 50 diverse recreation conservation groups wanted a way to increase volunteer efforts in our national forests, including the National Association of Counties. Mr. Speaker, there are a couple of additional provisions I want to highlight in this bill. It directs a study be done on utilizing fire crews for maintenance work during off seasons for wildfire, which is a great way for them to maximize, and for us to maximize, their skills in the forests. And it also requires the Secretary of Agriculture to identify 9 to 15 priority areas throughout the country to incorporate volunteers and to increase trail maintenance. This bill has broad support. It will produce opportunities for young people to volunteer in our forests. It will allow outfitters and guides to offset some of their permit fees through work on trail maintenance performed by the permit holders to construct, improve, or maintain National Forest System trails, trailheads, or developed sites under supervision of our National Park Service. This is kind of a motherhood and apple pie bill, Mr. Speaker, and it has been my pleasure to work with Mr. Walz and the other proponents of this bill to bring it to the floor this afternoon. {time} 1445 Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Walz), a cosponsor of the bill. Mr. WALZ. I thank the gentleman. I echo the statements made by the gentlewoman from Wyoming. First of all, the passion and the work that she and her staff have put into this is thanked by many millions of Americans who use these trails. The gentlewoman has chosen to make this her last session of Congress; so I would like to go on record and say that the people of the great State of Wyoming have been well served by the gentlewoman's passionate, ethical leadership and by her willingness to put the Nation's business first and get things done. I thank the gentlewoman. Mr. Speaker, this is a commonsense bill. The Nation's outdoor industry is a $645-billion-a-year industry which hires 6.1 million Americans. The great blessings that we have in this Nation of the most beautiful outdoor areas in the world are a legacy that we want to pass on. One of the issues is accessing those areas. Trail maintenance is absolutely critical. Listen to the groups of people who are behind this. These are pretty impressive and diverse groups of cosponsors, just to name a few: the National Association of Counties, the Wilderness Society, the Western Governors' Association, the Back Country Horsemen of America, Trout Unlimited, the American Motorcyclist Association, the National Wildlife Federation, and it goes on and on and on. The gentlewoman was referencing something that happened. This is a real-world fix to a real-world problem without its costing taxpayers money. I had the opportunity this summer to be out at Glacier National Park with my family and to be up on Going-to-the-Sun Road at Logan Pass and, I think, hiking one of the most beautiful stretches on the planet--the Highline Trail. We were out about 16 miles; it was midday; and I had my children, my nephew, and my brother-in-law. We were all there and were enjoying this when we saw two Park Service folks, two young men, over there, working really hard. They had packhorses to pack their stuff in, and they were shoring up a trail from the glaciers that was there. I just walked over to them, and they had no idea there were hikers on the trail. I said: I want to thank you both for the work you are doing. They said: If you really want to thank us, have your Congressman call and support Mrs. Lummis' bill on trail maintenance. I could not have been more shocked to expect that there, but they understood the importance of it. They understood that they need the help and that the volunteers are there under the guidance and the expertise of the Forest Service. When we cut through some of the red tape, we get people who care about the trails out there, and we fix the problem. I thank the gentlewoman and encourage the bill's support. Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Mrs. Lummis). Mrs. LUMMIS. I thank Mr. Rouzer for allowing me to do something I should have done, but Mr. Walz did it for me. That is to thank my staff, especially Jimmy Ward, for all of his hard work on this bill. He made sure that we continued to be moving this bill forward in his helping us to identify cosponsors and working with the scoring process, which is what brings us here today; so I want to say a particular thank you to my staff. Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Rouzer) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 845, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the [[Page H5878]] rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [House] [Pages H5875-H5878] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NATIONAL FOREST SYSTEM TRAILS STEWARDSHIP ACT Mr. ROUZER.

Refocusing on volunteers and partners to help the Forest Service is a commonsense way of making progress on the backlog and opening up these trails to public access. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. House of Representatives, Committee on Natural Resources, Washington, DC, September 14, 2016. Hon. K. Michael Conaway, Chairman, Committee on Agriculture, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: I write concerning H.R. 845, National Forest System Trails Stewardship Act, which was recently ordered to be reported by the Committee on Agriculture. As you are aware, the bill also was referred to the Committee on Natural Resources, as the bill contains provisions within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Natural Resources Committee. In the interest of permitting you to proceed expeditiously to floor consideration of this very important bill, this Committee agrees to discharge from further consideration of H.R. 845. I do so with the understanding that the Natural Resources Committee does not waive any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matter contained in the bill which fall within its Rule X jurisdiction. I also request that you urge the Speaker to name members of the Natural Resources Committee to any conference committee to consider such provisions. Please place this letter into the committee report on H.R. 845 and into the Congressional Record during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank you for the cooperative spirit in which you and your staff have worked regarding this matter and others between our respective committees, and congratulations on this significant achievement. Sincerely, Rob Bishop, Chairman. ____ House of Representatives, Committee on Agriculture, Washington, DC, September 13, 2016. Hon. Rob Bishop, Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: I appreciate your support in bringing H.R. 845, National Forest System Trails Stewardship Act, before the House of Representatives, and accordingly, understand that the Committee on Natural Resources will forego action on the bill. The Committee on Agriculture concurs in the mutual understanding that by foregoing consideration of the bill at this time, the Committee on Natural Resources does not [[Page H5877]] waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this bill or similar legislation in the future. In addition, should a conference on this bill be necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee on Natural Resources represented on the conference committee. I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional Record during Floor consideration. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward to continuing to work the Committee on Natural Resources as this bill moves through the legislative process. Sincerely, K. Michael Conaway, Chairman. Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 845, the National Forest System Trails Stewardship Act, is a bipartisan bill introduced by Representative Walz, a member of the Agriculture Committee, and Representative Lummis, a former member of the Agriculture Committee. A 2013 GAO Trails Maintenance Report found that the Forest Service has a backlog of more than $314 million in trail maintenance, which would be addressed by this legislation. The bill requires that the Forest Service develop a national strategy to double the amount of maintenance work done by volunteers in the next 5 years, ensuring our constituents can continue to use and enjoy these public spaces. The Agriculture Committee approved H.R. 845 by voice vote, and the bill is supported by a wide range of government, recreation, agriculture, conservation, sportsmen, and equestrian organizations. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Mrs. Lummis). Mrs. LUMMIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Rouzer). I also want to thank my former committee chairman on the House Agriculture Committee, now the ranking member, Mr. Peterson, for his support of this bill, as well as Chairman Conaway of the House Agriculture Committee. Mr. Speaker, in the national forests, especially in areas where there have been bark beetle damage, the trees are starting to fall across the trails. I have talked to outfitters who are taking pack trips into the national forests. They are only in there for 2 or 3 days, and when they try to get out they have to chop their way out because so many trees have fallen across the trails, even while they are in the forest. So this maintenance backlog is getting bigger. Mr. Speaker, it makes such sense, practically speaking, when we have a huge budget deficit, to maximize the use of volunteers in the national forests to help maintain these trails. Now, they will be able to avail themselves of workers comp, and that is part of the reason that it has taken this bill such a long time to get to the floor. But it came out of the Agriculture Committee unanimously. It is one of the most bipartisan bills in this entire Congress. It has 86 cosponsors in the House and 23 in the Senate. I want to thank my colleague, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Walz), who is a cosponsor of this bill, for his work. I am hoping he will tell the tale that he encountered this summer when he was hiking in the West. More than 50 diverse recreation conservation groups wanted a way to increase volunteer efforts in our national forests, including the National Association of Counties. Mr. Speaker, there are a couple of additional provisions I want to highlight in this bill. It directs a study be done on utilizing fire crews for maintenance work during off seasons for wildfire, which is a great way for them to maximize, and for us to maximize, their skills in the forests. And it also requires the Secretary of Agriculture to identify 9 to 15 priority areas throughout the country to incorporate volunteers and to increase trail maintenance. This bill has broad support. It will produce opportunities for young people to volunteer in our forests. It will allow outfitters and guides to offset some of their permit fees through work on trail maintenance performed by the permit holders to construct, improve, or maintain National Forest System trails, trailheads, or developed sites under supervision of our National Park Service. This is kind of a motherhood and apple pie bill, Mr. Speaker, and it has been my pleasure to work with Mr. Walz and the other proponents of this bill to bring it to the floor this afternoon. {time} 1445 Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Walz), a cosponsor of the bill. Mr. WALZ. I thank the gentleman. I echo the statements made by the gentlewoman from Wyoming. First of all, the passion and the work that she and her staff have put into this is thanked by many millions of Americans who use these trails. The gentlewoman has chosen to make this her last session of Congress; so I would like to go on record and say that the people of the great State of Wyoming have been well served by the gentlewoman's passionate, ethical leadership and by her willingness to put the Nation's business first and get things done. I thank the gentlewoman. Mr. Speaker, this is a commonsense bill. The Nation's outdoor industry is a $645-billion-a-year industry which hires 6.1 million Americans. The great blessings that we have in this Nation of the most beautiful outdoor areas in the world are a legacy that we want to pass on. One of the issues is accessing those areas. Trail maintenance is absolutely critical. Listen to the groups of people who are behind this. These are pretty impressive and diverse groups of cosponsors, just to name a few: the National Association of Counties, the Wilderness Society, the Western Governors' Association, the Back Country Horsemen of America, Trout Unlimited, the American Motorcyclist Association, the National Wildlife Federation, and it goes on and on and on. The gentlewoman was referencing something that happened. This is a real-world fix to a real-world problem without its costing taxpayers money. I had the opportunity this summer to be out at Glacier National Park with my family and to be up on Going-to-the-Sun Road at Logan Pass and, I think, hiking one of the most beautiful stretches on the planet--the Highline Trail. We were out about 16 miles; it was midday; and I had my children, my nephew, and my brother-in-law. We were all there and were enjoying this when we saw two Park Service folks, two young men, over there, working really hard. They had packhorses to pack their stuff in, and they were shoring up a trail from the glaciers that was there. I just walked over to them, and they had no idea there were hikers on the trail. I said: I want to thank you both for the work you are doing. They said: If you really want to thank us, have your Congressman call and support Mrs. Lummis' bill on trail maintenance. I could not have been more shocked to expect that there, but they understood the importance of it. They understood that they need the help and that the volunteers are there under the guidance and the expertise of the Forest Service. When we cut through some of the red tape, we get people who care about the trails out there, and we fix the problem. I thank the gentlewoman and encourage the bill's support. Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Mrs. Lummis). Mrs. LUMMIS. I thank Mr. Rouzer for allowing me to do something I should have done, but Mr. Walz did it for me. That is to thank my staff, especially Jimmy Ward, for all of his hard work on this bill. He made sure that we continued to be moving this bill forward in his helping us to identify cosponsors and working with the scoring process, which is what brings us here today; so I want to say a particular thank you to my staff. Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Rouzer) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 845, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the [[Page H5878]] rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_204.csv,25338,25338,25410,"[congressional record volume 162, number 145 (monday, september 26, 2016)] [house] [pages h5875-h5878] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] national forest system trails stewardship act mr. rouzer. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass bill (h.r. 845) to direct the secretary of agriculture to publish in the federal register a strategy to significantly increase the role of volunteers and partners in national forest system trail maintenance, and for other purposes, as amended. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 845 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title; table of contents.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5346, Securing Our Agriculture and Food Act, introduced by Congressman David Young of Iowa. This bill seeks to authorize the Department of Homeland Security's Food, Agriculture, and Veterinary Defense Program within the Office of Health Affairs. {time} 1515 Earlier this year, the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications held a hearing to examine the potential devastating impacts of an intentional attack on, or natural disruption of, U.S. agricultural or food production systems. The food and agriculture sector is critically important to our Nation's economy. U.S. food and agriculture accounts for roughly one- fifth of the Nation's economic activity, contributed $835 billion to the U.S. gross domestic product in 2014, and is responsible for 1 out of every 12 United States jobs. Coming from Iowa, Congressman Young knows all too well the importance of protecting this sector, which [[Page H5882]] is vital to the economy and our way of life. I appreciate him introducing this bill, which I am pleased to cosponsor. I want to thank Chairman Upton of the Committee on Energy and Commerce and Chairman Conaway of the Committee on Agriculture for working with us to advance this bill. This legislation received bipartisan support in the Committee on Homeland Security. I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

McCaul, Chairman. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5346, the Securing Our Agriculture and Food Act. H.R. 5346 would clarify the responsibilities of the Department of Homeland Security's Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs as they relate to the Department's responsibilities under HSPD-9, the Defense of U.S. Agriculture and Food. Accounting for nearly one-fifth of the economic activity of the Nation, agriculture is not only critical to human health, but also to the national economy. Although New Jersey's 10th Congressional District is not known for its rolling fields of corn or vast cattle ranches, it is home to large international ports. Customs and Border Protection agriculture specialists are on the front lines at the Port of Newark and Newark Liberty International Airport to protect domestic agriculture and food supply from foreign pathogens. These ports of entry are located in the largest consumer market in North America, reaching 23 million local consumers and 100 million more within a 36-hour reach. In fact, the Port of Newark and Newark Liberty International Airport are top-performing ports of entry with top interception numbers and several ``First-in-Nation'' insect finds. Despite the large size and enormous volume of these two ports, there are not enough agriculture specialists for the work that we need to be done. That is why I offered an amendment in the committee to direct the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs to coordinate activities with other DHS components, including Customs and Border Protection. I want to thank the subcommittee chairman for his support, and I am hopeful that the coordination required by my amendment will inform staffing decisions at U.S. ports of entry. We must do what we can to ensure the food and agriculture sector is protected. I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Young). Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Donovan and Ranking Member Payne. Last year's outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian influenza forced a tough and heartbreaking reality for many folks in Iowa's Third Congressional District, all over the State, and in districts across the country. Iowa suffered the largest animal disease outbreak in State history, devastating many farmers and producers by wiping out millions of layer hens, turkeys, and backyard flocks. Now, as the Federal Government scrambled to respond to last year's events, efforts revealed problems with their ability to react quickly and communicate with stakeholders. I heard from numerous farmers, producers, and other stakeholders frustrated by this lack of communication and delay in action. Response efforts to the outbreak also highlighted concerns about our country's ability to share information and quickly respond to potential agroterrorism threats and attacks. Now, as our Nation faces global and complex national security challenges, agroterrorism as well as future large-scale animal disease outbreaks pose serious threats to our food, agriculture, and livestock industries in the United States. [[Page H5883]] I introduced the Securing our Agriculture and Food Act, H.R. 5346, in order to address this issue by securing our Nation's agriculture industry, food supply, and ultimately protecting our consumers, our families, across the Nation. This agroterrorism preparedness legislation requires the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to elevate preparedness of our Nation's food, agriculture, and veterinary systems against terrorism and high-risk events. It also authorizes the Secretary, acting through the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, to collaborate with other Federal agencies to ensure food, agriculture, and animal and human health sectors receive much-needed attention, and are integrated into the Department's domestic preparedness policy initiatives. Whether we are preparing for future avian influenza outbreaks, animal disease outbreaks, or unforeseen emergencies or attacks, our Federal Government must have the tools and resources to act quickly and keep stakeholders informed. Parents should not have to worry about the safety of the food that they serve their children. We must ensure a safe and abundant food supply for our families; and my bill, this bipartisan bill, enables us to do just that. I want to thank all Members--Homeland Security Chairman McCaul, Ranking Member Thompson, Subcommittee Chairman Donovan, Ranking Member Payne for helping and making this a better bill, and Chairman Conaway of the Committee on Agriculture and Chairman Upton of the Committee on Energy and Commerce--who worked closely with me to bring this important bill to the floor. This was truly a collaborative effort and proves that we can do things in a bipartisan manner and together for the good of the country. I want to thank staff as well, especially those on the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications of the Committee on Homeland Security who worked so hard on this issue. Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of this bill. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5346 was unanimously approved by the Committee on Homeland Security on September 13. It recognizes the importance of securing our food and agriculture sector. Once again, I would like to reiterate that the proper agriculture specialist staffing at our ports helps to keep the diseases that are likely to jeopardize the agriculture industry and food supply out of this country. I hope that H.R. 5346 will help improve our ability to protect the agriculture industry from biothreats. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5346. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I, once again, urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5346. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Donovan) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5346, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [House] [Pages H5881-H5883] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SECURING OUR AGRICULTURE AND FOOD ACT Mr. DONOVAN.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5346, Securing Our Agriculture and Food Act, introduced by Congressman David Young of Iowa. This bill seeks to authorize the Department of Homeland Security's Food, Agriculture, and Veterinary Defense Program within the Office of Health Affairs. {time} 1515 Earlier this year, the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications held a hearing to examine the potential devastating impacts of an intentional attack on, or natural disruption of, U.S. agricultural or food production systems. The food and agriculture sector is critically important to our Nation's economy. U.S. food and agriculture accounts for roughly one- fifth of the Nation's economic activity, contributed $835 billion to the U.S. gross domestic product in 2014, and is responsible for 1 out of every 12 United States jobs. Coming from Iowa, Congressman Young knows all too well the importance of protecting this sector, which [[Page H5882]] is vital to the economy and our way of life. I appreciate him introducing this bill, which I am pleased to cosponsor. I want to thank Chairman Upton of the Committee on Energy and Commerce and Chairman Conaway of the Committee on Agriculture for working with us to advance this bill. This legislation received bipartisan support in the Committee on Homeland Security. I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. House of Representatives, Committee on Agriculture, Washington, DC, September 6, 2016. Hon. Michael McCaul, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC.

I recognize and appreciate your desire to bring this legislation before the House in an expeditious manner and, accordingly, I agree to discharge H.R. 5346 from further consideration by the Committee on Agriculture. I do so with the understanding that by discharging the bill, the Committee on Agriculture does not waive any future jurisdictional claim on this or similar matters. Further, the Committee on Agriculture reserves the right to seek the appointment of conferees, if it should become necessary.

McCaul, Chairman. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5346, the Securing Our Agriculture and Food Act. H.R. 5346 would clarify the responsibilities of the Department of Homeland Security's Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs as they relate to the Department's responsibilities under HSPD-9, the Defense of U.S. Agriculture and Food. Accounting for nearly one-fifth of the economic activity of the Nation, agriculture is not only critical to human health, but also to the national economy. Although New Jersey's 10th Congressional District is not known for its rolling fields of corn or vast cattle ranches, it is home to large international ports. Customs and Border Protection agriculture specialists are on the front lines at the Port of Newark and Newark Liberty International Airport to protect domestic agriculture and food supply from foreign pathogens. These ports of entry are located in the largest consumer market in North America, reaching 23 million local consumers and 100 million more within a 36-hour reach. In fact, the Port of Newark and Newark Liberty International Airport are top-performing ports of entry with top interception numbers and several ``First-in-Nation'' insect finds. Despite the large size and enormous volume of these two ports, there are not enough agriculture specialists for the work that we need to be done. That is why I offered an amendment in the committee to direct the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs to coordinate activities with other DHS components, including Customs and Border Protection. I want to thank the subcommittee chairman for his support, and I am hopeful that the coordination required by my amendment will inform staffing decisions at U.S. ports of entry. We must do what we can to ensure the food and agriculture sector is protected. I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Young). Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Donovan and Ranking Member Payne. Last year's outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian influenza forced a tough and heartbreaking reality for many folks in Iowa's Third Congressional District, all over the State, and in districts across the country. Iowa suffered the largest animal disease outbreak in State history, devastating many farmers and producers by wiping out millions of layer hens, turkeys, and backyard flocks. Now, as the Federal Government scrambled to respond to last year's events, efforts revealed problems with their ability to react quickly and communicate with stakeholders. I heard from numerous farmers, producers, and other stakeholders frustrated by this lack of communication and delay in action. Response efforts to the outbreak also highlighted concerns about our country's ability to share information and quickly respond to potential agroterrorism threats and attacks. Now, as our Nation faces global and complex national security challenges, agroterrorism as well as future large-scale animal disease outbreaks pose serious threats to our food, agriculture, and livestock industries in the United States. [[Page H5883]] I introduced the Securing our Agriculture and Food Act, H.R. 5346, in order to address this issue by securing our Nation's agriculture industry, food supply, and ultimately protecting our consumers, our families, across the Nation. This agroterrorism preparedness legislation requires the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to elevate preparedness of our Nation's food, agriculture, and veterinary systems against terrorism and high-risk events. It also authorizes the Secretary, acting through the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, to collaborate with other Federal agencies to ensure food, agriculture, and animal and human health sectors receive much-needed attention, and are integrated into the Department's domestic preparedness policy initiatives. Whether we are preparing for future avian influenza outbreaks, animal disease outbreaks, or unforeseen emergencies or attacks, our Federal Government must have the tools and resources to act quickly and keep stakeholders informed. Parents should not have to worry about the safety of the food that they serve their children. We must ensure a safe and abundant food supply for our families; and my bill, this bipartisan bill, enables us to do just that. I want to thank all Members--Homeland Security Chairman McCaul, Ranking Member Thompson, Subcommittee Chairman Donovan, Ranking Member Payne for helping and making this a better bill, and Chairman Conaway of the Committee on Agriculture and Chairman Upton of the Committee on Energy and Commerce--who worked closely with me to bring this important bill to the floor. This was truly a collaborative effort and proves that we can do things in a bipartisan manner and together for the good of the country. I want to thank staff as well, especially those on the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications of the Committee on Homeland Security who worked so hard on this issue. Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of this bill. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5346 was unanimously approved by the Committee on Homeland Security on September 13. It recognizes the importance of securing our food and agriculture sector. Once again, I would like to reiterate that the proper agriculture specialist staffing at our ports helps to keep the diseases that are likely to jeopardize the agriculture industry and food supply out of this country. I hope that H.R. 5346 will help improve our ability to protect the agriculture industry from biothreats. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5346. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I, once again, urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5346. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Donovan) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5346, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_204.csv,17020,17020,17092,"[congressional record volume 162, number 145 (monday, september 26, 2016)] [house] [pages h5881-h5883] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] securing our agriculture and food act mr. donovan. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 5346) to amend the homeland security act of 2002 to make the assistant secretary of homeland security for health affairs responsible for coordinating the efforts of the department of homeland security related to food, agriculture, and veterinary defense against terrorism, and for other purposes, as amended. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 5346 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``securing our agriculture and food act''. sec. 2. coordination of food, agriculture, and veterinary defense against terrorism.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 2754) to designate the Federal building and United States courthouse located at 300 Fannin Street in Shreveport, Louisiana, as the ``Tom Stagg Federal Building and United States Courthouse'', as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: S. 2754 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. DESIGNATION. The Federal building and United States courthouse located at 300 Fannin Street in Shreveport, Louisiana, shall be known and designated as the ``Tom Stagg United States Court House''. SEC. 2.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, S. 2754, as amended, would designate the Federal building and United States courthouse located at 300 Fannin Street in Shreveport, Louisiana, as the Tom Stagg United States Court House. =========================== NOTE =========================== September 26, 2016, on page H5885, the following appeared: Tom Stagg United States Courthouse. The online version has been corrected to read: Tom Stagg United States Court House. ========================= END NOTE ========================= I want to thank the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Fleming), for his leadership on this legislation. Judge Stagg served in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana. He was appointed to the bench in 1974, served as a chief judge from 1984 to 1991, and assumed senior status in 1992. He served until his death last year. Earlier in his career, he held various executive positions in the private sector and was in the private practice of law. {time} 1545 Judge Stagg served our country during World War II, during our Greatest Generation, as a U.S. Army captain in the infantry. He earned the Combat Infantry Badge, Bronze Stars for Valor and Meritorious Service, and the Purple Heart with Oak Leaf Cluster. Judge Stagg's dedication to serving our country is clear, and I believe it is appropriate to name this courthouse after him. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank my colleague from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis). Mr. Speaker, I also support this bill, as amended, which honors Judge Stagg by naming the Federal courthouse in Shreveport, Louisiana, after him. He served over 40 years, as was noted, as a district judge in the Western District of Louisiana. He was a lifelong Louisianan, who attended Louisiana State University for both his undergrad and law school education. I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this important piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend my colleague, Mr. Carson. As members of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, this isn't unusual where we come together to do important bipartisan pieces of legislation to recognize some of America's heroes. I urge passage of this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2754, which would name the U.S. Federal Court House in Shreveport, Louisiana after Tom Stagg. Judge Stagg's legacy is one which speaks volumes of his exemplar character and distinguished career as a federal judge for the Western District of Louisiana. Upon graduation from high school, Judge Stagg valiantly served in WWII where he would rise to the rank of captain and earn the Combat Infantryman Badge, a Bronze Star for Valor, a second Bronze Star for meritorious service, and the Purple Heart with oak leaf cluster. The patriotism and dedication which he exhibited as a soldier was further built upon when he began his career as a jurist. He was nominated to serve as a federal judge for the Western District of Louisiana in 1974. He held the position as chief judge from 1984 to 1991, at which point he assumed senior status and maintained a full caseload until his passing in 2015. A detailed man who commanded respect whenever he entered a room, Judge Stagg was well known for his institutional knowledge, efficiency, and thoroughness during each and every case. He was heavily admired by his colleagues, many of whom believed that his character reflected the most honorable qualities of a judge. A pillar within his occupation and the salt within his community, Judge Stagg's life was an example to us all. It is more than fitting to honor Judge Stagg's service by naming this court house, a court house which he helped design, after him. I introduced companion legislation, H.R. 5011, in the House, and I am thankful that we are able to consider S. 2754 today. I ask my colleagues for their support. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 2754, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.

Earlier in his career, he held various executive positions in the private sector and was in the private practice of law. {time} 1545 Judge Stagg served our country during World War II, during our Greatest Generation, as a U.S. Army captain in the infantry.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank my colleague from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis). Mr. Speaker, I also support this bill, as amended, which honors Judge Stagg by naming the Federal courthouse in Shreveport, Louisiana, after him.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2754, which would name the U.S. Federal Court House in Shreveport, Louisiana after Tom Stagg. Judge Stagg's legacy is one which speaks volumes of his exemplar character and distinguished career as a federal judge for the Western District of Louisiana. Upon graduation from high school, Judge Stagg valiantly served in WWII where he would rise to the rank of captain and earn the Combat Infantryman Badge, a Bronze Star for Valor, a second Bronze Star for meritorious service, and the Purple Heart with oak leaf cluster. The patriotism and dedication which he exhibited as a soldier was further built upon when he began his career as a jurist. He was nominated to serve as a federal judge for the Western District of Louisiana in 1974. He held the position as chief judge from 1984 to 1991, at which point he assumed senior status and maintained a full caseload until his passing in 2015. A detailed man who commanded respect whenever he entered a room, Judge Stagg was well known for his institutional knowledge, efficiency, and thoroughness during each and every case. He was heavily admired by his colleagues, many of whom believed that his character reflected the most honorable qualities of a judge. A pillar within his occupation and the salt within his community, Judge Stagg's life was an example to us all. It is more than fitting to honor Judge Stagg's service by naming this court house, a court house which he helped design, after him.

Mr. Speaker, I also support this bill, which names the Federal building and U.S. Courthouse in El Paso, Texas, after Judge Thomason. He served as prosecutor. State legislator, mayor, even U.S. Congressman, as well as a Federal Judge. In his career as a politician, he was known for his commitment to public works and economic development. In his second career as a Federal judge, he was acclaimed for even handling of high-profile cases and managing a considerable workload of civil and criminal cases. I urge my colleagues to join me in advancing this legislation, which honors a great judge for his dedication to the good of the public. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. O'Rourke). Mr. O'ROURKE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Indiana for yielding to me and for his support of this bill. I would also like to thank my colleague from Illinois for his kind words of support in recognizing the accomplishments of Robert Ewing Thomason, referred to as ``R.E.'' or ``Ewing'' by his friends in El Paso. Judge Thomason was truly the best among us, somebody who dedicated his life to public service and to serving others, and someone who really distinguished the community that I am so honored to serve, El Paso, Texas. He was first elected to the Texas House of Representatives in 1920 and, remarkably, for an El Pasoan and, really, for anyone in the State of Texas, in his second term only, he was elected by his fellow House members to be the Speaker of the House of Representatives in the State of Texas. This is an accomplishment to which no other El Pasoan since has ever been able to rise. This truly was the high-water mark, at least in State politics, for an El Pasoan to reach. There he distinguished himself with his leadership and with his dedication, not just to our community, but to the State of Texas. He then served as the mayor of El Paso, Texas, from 1927 to 1930, where he both reflected and truly guided the growth of one of the great American cities and, certainly, the greatest Southwestern city at the time. He was responsible for attracting industry, promoting local businesses, and developing the first municipal airport in El Paso, Texas. He was then elected to the United States House of Representatives where, again, he served with distinction, rising to the level of the vice chairman of the Armed Services Committee during World War II--I would think, the period of the greatest stress and greatest demand for leadership out of that House committee--and again, he distinguished himself. But it is truly for his service as a Federal judge for the Western District of Texas that we now remember Judge Thomason. He heard thousands of cases, presided over thousands of citizenship ceremonies. But the case, Mr. Speaker, that I want to call to everyone's attention began in 1954, when 12 African American El Pasoans attempted to enroll in what was then known as Texas Western College, today known as the University of Texas at El Paso, part of Texas' University of Texas system. Thelma White and 11 friends, one of whom, Mildred Parish Tutt, is the mother of our colleague, Barbara Lee, of Oakland, California, these 12 young El Pasoans attempted to enroll at Texas Western College; and, because of the segregation clause in our State's constitution, they were barred entry. Thelma White, who became the lead plaintiff, enlisted the support and advocacy of future Supreme Court Jurist Thurgood Marshall to promote the idea that no institution of higher learning in the State of Texas should bar anyone, including the African American students in question. That case was heard in the courtroom of Judge Thomason, and, in 1955, he enjoined the State of Texas from barring these students from entry. They were able to go to Texas Western College. It absolutely shattered the concept and practice of all-white higher education in the State of Texas. In fact, he decimated the segregation clause of our State's constitution and destroyed one of the last bastions of segregation in the former Confederacy. How fitting that his courtroom was in the old Federal courthouse which, today, we seek to name in his honor. And even more fitting is the Tom Lea mural, one of our famous El Paso artists, the Tom Lea mural that graces this Federal courthouse, the old Federal courthouse in El Paso Texas. It has the following legend over the door: ``O Pass of the North, Now the Old Giants Are Gone, We Little Men Live Where Heroes Once Walked the Inviolate Earth.'' A very fitting description of one of the giants that preceded us in El Paso, Texas, Judge Thomason. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. It is amazing to be able to come to this floor and learn historical facts about other congressional districts. In my district, I am lucky enough to represent part of Abraham Lincoln's old congressional district, so the history involved with Abraham Lincoln and what he meant to this country is something that our textbooks teach. We come to this House floor to learn about courageous people like Judge Thomason, who served in the executive branch as mayor of El Paso, the legislative branch in the State and here, and then served in the judicial branch. To be honored, I think it is a testament, and I, once again, want to commend my colleague, Mr. O'Rourke, for bringing this to our attention and for [[Page H5887]] allowing this honor to, hopefully, be bestowed upon that courthouse. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5873. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed.

He was then elected to the United States House of Representatives where, again, he served with distinction, rising to the level of the vice chairman of the Armed Services Committee during World War II--I would think, the period of the greatest stress and greatest demand for leadership out of that House committee--and again, he distinguished himself. But it is truly for his service as a Federal judge for the Western District of Texas that we now remember Judge Thomason. He heard thousands of cases, presided over thousands of citizenship ceremonies. But the case, Mr. Speaker, that I want to call to everyone's attention began in 1954, when 12 African American El Pasoans attempted to enroll in what was then known as Texas Western College, today known as the University of Texas at El Paso, part of Texas' University of Texas system. Thelma White and 11 friends, one of whom, Mildred Parish Tutt, is the mother of our colleague, Barbara Lee, of Oakland, California, these 12 young El Pasoans attempted to enroll at Texas Western College; and, because of the segregation clause in our State's constitution, they were barred entry. Thelma White, who became the lead plaintiff, enlisted the support and advocacy of future Supreme Court Jurist Thurgood Marshall to promote the idea that no institution of higher learning in the State of Texas should bar anyone, including the African American students in question. That case was heard in the courtroom of Judge Thomason, and, in 1955, he enjoined the State of Texas from barring these students from entry. They were able to go to Texas Western College. It absolutely shattered the concept and practice of all-white higher education in the State of Texas. In fact, he decimated the segregation clause of our State's constitution and destroyed one of the last bastions of segregation in the former Confederacy. How fitting that his courtroom was in the old Federal courthouse which, today, we seek to name in his honor. And even more fitting is the Tom Lea mural, one of our famous El Paso artists, the Tom Lea mural that graces this Federal courthouse, the old Federal courthouse in El Paso Texas. It has the following legend over the door: ``O Pass of the North, Now the Old Giants Are Gone, We Little Men Live Where Heroes Once Walked the Inviolate Earth.''

He was first elected to the Texas House of Representatives in 1920 and, remarkably, for an El Pasoan and, really, for anyone in the State of Texas, in his second term only, he was elected by his fellow House members to be the Speaker of the House of Representatives in the State of Texas. This is an accomplishment to which no other El Pasoan since has ever been able to rise. This truly was the high-water mark, at least in State politics, for an El Pasoan to reach. There he distinguished himself with his leadership and with his dedication, not just to our community, but to the State of Texas.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 5162) to amend title 38, United States Code, to authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to disclose to non- Department of Veterans Affairs health care providers certain medical records of veterans who receive health care from such providers. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 5162 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Vet Connect Act of 2016''. SEC. 2. AUTHORITY TO DISCLOSE CERTAIN MEDICAL RECORDS OF VETERANS WHO RECEIVE NON-DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS HEALTH CARE. Section 7332(b)(2) of title 38, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new subparagraph: ``(H) To a non-Department entity (including private entities and other departments or agencies of the Federal Government) that provides hospital care or medical treatment to veterans.''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Miller) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Takano) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. General Leave Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members would have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks or add any extraneous material. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5162, the Vet Connect Act. Ensuring that veterans receive high-quality care has been a top priority of mine and our committee, and as the access and accountability crisis of 2014 so clearly demonstrated, the Department of Veterans Affairs alone cannot provide the timely access to care that our veterans deserve. While the passage of the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act 2 years ago has led to an increase in VA's use of community providers to treat veteran patients and linked many veterans to care they would otherwise be waiting for, the Department's struggle to adequately and consistently communicate with community partners about the veterans they are jointly caring for now has presented unnecessary challenges to VA's care in the communities' efforts. H.R. 5162 would correct this deficiency by requiring VA to share medical record information with community providers in order to provide care or treatment to a shared patient. Mr. Speaker, this would ensure that any provider caring for a VA patient, whether in a VA medical facility or in a private sector doctor's office, has the information that they need to provide safe and quality care. H.R. 5162 is sponsored by my friend and colleague and fellow committee member, Congressman Beto O'Rourke from Texas. I am grateful to him for his efforts and his leadership in sponsoring this important legislation. This bill is supported by the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, and the Vietnam Veterans of America, and I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting it as well. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5162, the Vet Connect Act of 2016. The bill is sponsored by my friend and classmate, Congressman Beto O'Rourke. In 2014, when Congress passed the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act, we created a program called Choice, to make access to care easier for veterans who were unable to get an appointment at their local VA medical center. These veterans have now been able to get care closer to their home with the provider of their choice. However, current law prevented the community providers from getting records from the VA regarding the previous care veterans had received. This bill gives the VA authority to disclose certain medical records of veterans who receive non-VA care to community providers. Essentially, this would allow the VA to share health information with the veteran's non-VA doctor without having HIPAA implications. Current treatments are already covered under HIPAA, and this bill would allow previous treatments to be disclosed, thereby improving the continuity of care. {time} 1600 I commend my colleague from Texas for being a leader in ensuring safe, quality health care for veterans. He has been a champion for veterans in El Paso and has turned the concerns that he has heard from his constituents into thoughtful legislation that helps veterans across our country. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this legislation and urge my colleagues to support this bill as well. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. O'Rourke), the author of this bill. Mr. O'ROURKE. Mr. Speaker, I would also like to thank my colleague, the ranking member, Mr. Takano from California, for his support and his work on the committee and not just promoting commonsense bills like these, but working across the aisle with colleagues on both sides to ensure that we move the concerns and the cares of veterans in this country forward. His leadership at this critical time is so important, and I am grateful for it. I would also like to thank the chairman of our committee, Mr. Miller from Florida, for his leadership in really ensuring that the House Veterans' Affairs Committee remains one of the most important and perhaps one of the last refuges for bipartisanship in Congress. It is really through his leadership--and I have been lucky enough to serve with him now almost 4 years--that we have been able to do some really outstanding things for veterans in this country. I know that he would be the first to agree that we are not there yet. There is no ``mission accomplished'' banner that hangs behind us, but we have made extraordinary progress under his guidance and his willingness to work with Members from both sides of the aisle--all Members of the committee--and I am truly grateful for his support of this bill. I should also note, Mr. Speaker, that this bill is cosponsored by Dr. Benishek from Michigan, a stout defender of veterans and, from his medical background, someone who is uniquely capable of informing important legislation like this one. As both of the previous speakers have stated, this ensures that we connect veterans in our communities, the places that we represent, with the care that they have earned and that they deserve. In the VA today, we have an acknowledged shortage of 43,000 clinical positions. We have to acknowledge that we will not be able to see every single veteran in the instances when they most need care with current capacity within the VA. Therefore, it is incumbent upon us to ensure that we leverage the capacity of the doctors, nurses, and providers in the communities that we represent to the best of our ability. Critical to that is health information exchange records sharing so that the doctors in the community know what they need to know about the veteran they are about to see so they deliver the best, most informed care that they can possibly deliver, and that we get the best outcomes for these veterans. This bill ensures that we share medical information effectively, privately, conforming to HIPAA, maintaining the veteran's privacy, and yet effectively ensure that that veteran gets the care that they have earned, that they need, [[Page H5888]] that they deserve and that--thanks to this committee and its leadership--they are finally beginning to get. Those who are charged with ensuring that we coordinate care between the VA and private providers say that this is the most critical thing for us to do if we are to effectively share patient record information. It is estimated that today only about 3 percent of veterans proactively opt into this records sharing. That means that most of them are not getting the fully informed care that they would otherwise get. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in support of this bill, which would go a long way to ensuring that we do everything we can with the capacity both within the VA and outside the VA to deliver critical care to our veterans who are most in need. Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in passing this legislation, H.R. 5162. I, once again, thank my colleague, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. O'Rourke) for his passionate advocacy for veterans. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, again, I urge all of my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Miller) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5162. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed.

In 2014, when Congress passed the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act, we created a program called Choice, to make access to care easier for veterans who were unable to get an appointment at their local VA medical center. These veterans have now been able to get care closer to their home with the provider of their choice. However, current law prevented the community providers from getting records from the VA regarding the previous care veterans had received. This bill gives the VA authority to disclose certain medical records of veterans who receive non-VA care to community providers. Essentially, this would allow the VA to share health information with the veteran's non-VA doctor without having HIPAA implications. Current treatments are already covered under HIPAA, and this bill would allow previous treatments to be disclosed, thereby improving the continuity of care. {time} 1600 I commend my colleague from Texas for being a leader in ensuring safe, quality health care for veterans. He has been a champion for veterans in El Paso and has turned the concerns that he has heard from his constituents into thoughtful legislation that helps veterans across our country. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this legislation and urge my colleagues to support this bill as well. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. O'Rourke), the author of this bill. Mr. O'ROURKE. Mr. Speaker, I would also like to thank my colleague, the ranking member, Mr. Takano from California, for his support and his work on the committee and not just promoting commonsense bills like these, but working across the aisle with colleagues on both sides to ensure that we move the concerns and the cares of veterans in this country forward. His leadership at this critical time is so important, and I am grateful for it. I would also like to thank the chairman of our committee, Mr. Miller from Florida, for his leadership in really ensuring that the House Veterans' Affairs Committee remains one of the most important and perhaps one of the last refuges for bipartisanship in Congress. It is really through his leadership--and I have been lucky enough to serve with him now almost 4 years--that we have been able to do some really outstanding things for veterans in this country. I know that he would be the first to agree that we are not there yet. There is no ``mission accomplished'' banner that hangs behind us, but we have made extraordinary progress under his guidance and his willingness to work with Members from both sides of the aisle--all Members of the committee--and I am truly grateful for his support of this bill. I should also note, Mr. Speaker, that this bill is cosponsored by Dr. Benishek from Michigan, a stout defender of veterans and, from his medical background, someone who is uniquely capable of informing important legislation like this one. As both of the previous speakers have stated, this ensures that we connect veterans in our communities, the places that we represent, with the care that they have earned and that they deserve. In the VA today, we have an acknowledged shortage of 43,000 clinical positions. We have to acknowledge that we will not be able to see every single veteran in the instances when they most need care with current capacity within the VA. Therefore, it is incumbent upon us to ensure that we leverage the capacity of the doctors, nurses, and providers in the communities that we represent to the best of our ability. Critical to that is health information exchange records sharing so that the doctors in the community know what they need to know about the veteran they are about to see so they deliver the best, most informed care that they can possibly deliver, and that we get the best outcomes for these veterans. This bill ensures that we share medical information effectively, privately, conforming to HIPAA, maintaining the veteran's privacy, and yet effectively ensure that that veteran gets the care that they have earned, that they need, [[Page H5888]] that they deserve and that--thanks to this committee and its leadership--they are finally beginning to get. Those who are charged with ensuring that we coordinate care between the VA and private providers say that this is the most critical thing for us to do if we are to effectively share patient record information. It is estimated that today only about 3 percent of veterans proactively opt into this records sharing. That means that most of them are not getting the fully informed care that they would otherwise get. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in support of this bill, which would go a long way to ensuring that we do everything we can with the capacity both within the VA and outside the VA to deliver critical care to our veterans who are most in need. Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in passing this legislation, H.R. 5162. I, once again, thank my colleague, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. O'Rourke) for his passionate advocacy for veterans. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, again, I urge all of my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Miller) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5162. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [House] [Pages H5887-H5888] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] VET CONNECT ACT OF 2016 Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 5162) to amend title 38, United States Code, to authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to disclose to non- Department of Veterans Affairs health care providers certain medical records of veterans who receive health care from such providers. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 5162 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Vet Connect Act of 2016''. SEC. 2. AUTHORITY TO DISCLOSE CERTAIN MEDICAL RECORDS OF VETERANS WHO RECEIVE NON-DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS HEALTH CARE. Section 7332(b)(2) of title 38, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new subparagraph: ``(H) To a non-Department entity (including private entities and other departments or agencies of the Federal Government) that provides hospital care or medical treatment to veterans.''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Miller) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Takano) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. General Leave Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members would have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks or add any extraneous material. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5162, the Vet Connect Act. Ensuring that veterans receive high-quality care has been a top priority of mine and our committee, and as the access and accountability crisis of 2014 so clearly demonstrated, the Department of Veterans Affairs alone cannot provide the timely access to care that our veterans deserve. While the passage of the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act 2 years ago has led to an increase in VA's use of community providers to treat veteran patients and linked many veterans to care they would otherwise be waiting for, the Department's struggle to adequately and consistently communicate with community partners about the veterans they are jointly caring for now has presented unnecessary challenges to VA's care in the communities' efforts. H.R. 5162 would correct this deficiency by requiring VA to share medical record information with community providers in order to provide care or treatment to a shared patient. Mr. Speaker, this would ensure that any provider caring for a VA patient, whether in a VA medical facility or in a private sector doctor's office, has the information that they need to provide safe and quality care. H.R. 5162 is sponsored by my friend and colleague and fellow committee member, Congressman Beto O'Rourke from Texas. I am grateful to him for his efforts and his leadership in sponsoring this important legislation. This bill is supported by the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, and the Vietnam Veterans of America, and I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting it as well.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 5392) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to improve the Veterans Crisis Line. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 5392 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``No Veterans Crisis Line Call Should Go Unanswered Act''. SEC. 2. IMPROVEMENTS TO VETERANS CRISIS LINE. (a) Quality Assurance Document.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall develop a quality assurance document to use in carrying out the Veterans Crisis Line. Such document shall-- (1) outline clearly defined and measurable performance indicators and objectives to improve the responsiveness and performance of the Veterans Crisis Line, including at backup call centers; (2) include quantifiable timeframes to meet designated objectives to assist the Secretary in tracking the progress of the Veterans Crisis Line and such backup call centers in meeting the performance indicators and objectives specified in paragraph (1); and (3) with respect to such timeframes and objectives, be consistent with guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget. (b) Plan.--The Secretary shall develop a plan to ensure that each telephone call, text message, and other communications received by the Veterans Crisis Line, including at backup call centers, is answered in a timely manner by a person, consistent with the guidance established by the American Association of Suicidology. Such plan shall include guidelines to carry out periodic testing of the Veterans Crisis Line, including such backup centers, during each fiscal year to identify and correct any problems in a timely manner. (c) Submission.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Senate a report containing the document developed under subsection (a) and the plan developed under subsection (b). (d) Veterans Crisis Line Defined.--In this section, the term ``Veterans Crisis Line'' means the toll-free hotline for veterans established under section 1720F(h) of title 38, United States Code. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Miller) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Takano) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. General Leave Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to add extraneous material. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5392, the No Veterans Crisis Line Should Go Unanswered Act. The Department of Veterans Affairs established the Veterans Crisis Line to ensure that any veteran that was contemplating suicide would be able to call for help no matter the time and no matter the circumstance. Over time, VCL's mission has expanded to include veterans facing all manners of personal emergencies, and the Veterans Crisis Line services have expanded to include a chat service and a texting operation. Yet the crisis line purpose has remained the same: to provide a place where veterans facing crisis would be able to get the help that they need any time of day or night. However, earlier this year, the VA Inspector General found that some calls to the crisis line were routed to backup crisis centers and ultimately sent to voice mail and that other line callers did not receive the immediate assistance that they desperately needed. The IG also noted that VA failed to provide a directive or handbook detailing the guidance necessary for the proper Veterans Crisis Line processes and procedures, and it failed to provide adequate orientation and training to crisis line staff, it failed to monitor contracted backup call centers, and experienced a number of quality assurance gaps. Though VA has assured us that these issues have been addressed and will never happen again, the risk of leaving a veteran in the midst of a crisis alone and without help is unacceptable to any Member of this body. H.R. 5392 would require that VA develops a quality assurance document that includes clearly defined and measurable performance standards with appropriate timelines and benchmarks to improve responsiveness and outcomes for the crisis line mainline and contracted backup call centers. It would also require VA to develop a plan to ensure that each telephone call, each text message, or other communications received by the crisis line mainline or at a contracted backup call center is answered in a timely manner by an appropriate, qualified live person, consistent with the guidance established by the American Association of Suicidology. This bill is sponsored by my friend and colleague, Congressman David Young from Iowa. I want to thank him for his efforts and his leadership on sponsoring this very important and, to some, very simple fix to something that needs to be taken care of. Nothing could be more important than guaranteed timely access to the veterans' services and support that they need in an emergency situation. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this commonsense piece of legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today regarding H.R. 5392, the No Veterans Crisis Line Call Should Go Unanswered Act. The Veterans Crisis Line actually provides three ways veterans can access help when they are in crisis. Veterans, servicemembers, and their loved ones can call the 1-800 number, send a text message, or chat online to receive free, confidential support 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, even if they are not registered with VA or enrolled in VA health care. The responders at the Veterans Crisis Line are especially trained and experienced in helping veterans of all ages and circumstances, from those coping with mental health issues that were never addressed to recent veterans dealing with relationships or the transition back to civilian life. Since its launch in 2007 through May 2016, the Veterans Crisis Line has answered over 2.3 million calls and initiated the dispatch of emergency services to callers in imminent crisis nearly 61,000 times. This bill requires improvements to the Veterans Crisis Line by having the [[Page H5889]] VA create quality assurance guidelines that will include clearly defined and measurable performance indicators and objectives to improve the responsiveness and performance of the Veterans Crisis Line. The bill also requires the VA to develop a plan to ensure that each telephone call, text message, and other communications received by the Veterans Crisis Line is answered in a timely manner by a person, consistent with the guidance established by the American Association of Suicidology. As Suicide Prevention Awareness Month comes to a close, Congress must take these necessary steps to improve the Veterans Crisis Line for all veterans who depend on it. I support this legislation, and I urge its passage. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MILLER of Florida. I am proud to introduce the sponsor of this important piece of legislation. The gentleman is from the Third District of Iowa, from the small town of Van Meter, Iowa, home to Bob ``The Heater From Van Meter.'' Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Young). Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, I introduced the No Veterans Crisis Line Call Should Go Unanswered Act, H.R. 5392, a bipartisan piece of legislation, doing this after hearing from a constituent who called the Veterans Crisis Line for help but never was connected to a live person. Though I have spoken on the floor about this issue before, as well as others, I remain deeply concerned with the many struggles and challenges our veterans face as they transition from Active Duty to civilian life and beyond. These are brave women and men who have sacrificed much in service to their country. Now, our servicemembers have given up holidays, missed birthdays, weddings, and other important life events of their family members, communities, and friends. They have been mobilized or deployed to some of the most volatile regions of the world for months on end, and the list goes on. They are our friends, family, and neighbors, and they make significant sacrifices because they believe in this great Nation and strive to protect the freedoms we have guaranteed. Now, unfortunately, more and more veterans carry deep scars-- emotional war wounds--ones we cannot see. These men and women deserve our support. Now, our country has a responsibility to ensure our brave veterans not only have the benefits that they have earned, but have access to services and resources intended to help them through the storms of life. Mr. Speaker, it is hard for anyone to ask for help sometimes, and the sad fact is today and every day this week, 20 veterans will take their lives. So it is unacceptable for any veteran who is reaching out for help and a listening ear to be turned away unanswered, especially when help may mean the difference between life and death. That is why I introduced, with bipartisan support from my colleagues, legislation to make critical improvements to the Veterans Crisis Line. This bipartisan bill requires the VA to create and implement documented plans to improve responsiveness and performance of the crisis line--an important step to ensure our veterans have unimpeded access to the mental health resources that they need. Even the VA has acknowledged these problems, which were also documented in two separate investigations conducted by the VA Office of Inspector General and the Government Accountability Office. This bill drives accountability within the Veterans Crisis Line, ensuring any call or text or messages are answered, and ensuring the quality processes, including those guiding staff training, are addressed and provided to Congress. {time} 1615 Our men and women in uniform have answered our Nation's call, and we must work to do better and ensure their calls do not go unanswered. Mr. Speaker, I want to especially thank Chairman Miller and his staff for working so closely with me on this bill. It is a pleasure serving with him, and his leadership on these issues will be missed in his retirement. September is National Suicide Prevention Awareness Month. It is only fitting that we pass this bill today to help our veterans. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Walz), my colleague and friend, the highest ranking noncommissioned officer to serve in Congress. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Takano) for his unwavering work for the care of our veterans. And to the chairman, as has been noted so often, at a time when partisanship seems to win the day or be on the news, I can assure him that the care of our Nation's veterans knows no political boundaries, and the work that has been done should be noted. I also want to thank the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Young) for bringing this bill forward. Like everything in life, there is a symmetry to things, and I think the story of how we got to this point might be well spoken or told. The gentleman represents the Third District of Iowa, the new one. Back in 2006, there was a young Army Reservist named Joshua Omvig, who grew up in a small community in Iowa, literally down the road from where they filmed ``Field of Dreams.'' He returned from Iraq a week before Thanksgiving in 2006 and joined his family at that most American of all holidays to be back together. That evening of Thanksgiving, Joshua took his own life in front of his mother. The crushing loss of a son, the crushing loss of a son of the Midwest was overwhelming. But the Omvigs did something that Americans do and something that this Nation always does. They turned their grief into action. They went to their Congressman at that time in the old Third District, Lieutenant Colonel Leonard Boswell, himself a decorated Vietnam veteran and helicopter pilot. They put together what then became the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act. This was back in 2007, when nobody was talking about 20 veterans a day and no one was talking about mental health and no one was talking much about transition. We were in the heart of the Iraq war. We were in Afghanistan. Our veterans were coming back, and, rightfully noted, we were unprepared for them. In this piece of legislation, there are a couple of sections in here that are very clear on what Mr. Young's legislation does--exactly what it should do and what this Congress should do--provide oversight and improve on legislation. Section 1720F said that the VA would establish 24-hour mental health care. In carrying out the comprehensive program, the Secretary shall provide for mental health care availability to veterans on a 24-hour basis. It would establish a hotline to carry this out, and the Secretary would provide a toll-free hotline for veterans to be staffed by appropriately trained mental health professionals. And for those who don't think that that was needed, since that time, 2.5 million calls have been made to that hotline, 300,000 online chats, and 55,000 texts. When someone calls that line, they are at a breaking point. One of our warriors is at a point where they had nowhere else to turn. The intent of this Congress and this Nation--not Democrat, not Republican--was to provide them the resources and the trained personnel necessary. What was noted in a GAO report, what Mr. Young has noted, and what this committee has noted is that the VA was not fulfilling fully what they should have. If one veteran falls through the cracks, we have failed. I don't care if 2.5 million were picked up. If 2.5 million plus one, and that last one was not picked up, we have failed. Mr. Young's piece of legislation is simple, eloquent, asks the VA to do what they are supposed to do, and then do what should expected: report back to Congress so that we can provide our oversight ability. I want to thank the chairman, the ranking member, and this committee for doing exactly what we are supposed to do. We are supposed to make sure that the VA fulfills the commitment that the United States and its citizens want to care for every single veteran that is out there. This was a smart piece of legislation. It was championed by the parents of a warrior who took his own life. [[Page H5890]] And keep in mind, when this was championed, we did not even bury our veterans who took their own lives with military honors because it was still something we didn't talk about. It was believed that they weren't casualties of war. In the 10 years since that time, we have made strides, we have made progress, and we understand that the cost of war continues on. I want to thank Mr. Young for continuing the legacy that comes out of Iowa, the deep care for those that serve in our heartland, continuing the bipartisan legacy of the Third District of Iowa to improve on a really smart, needed piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this, and I encourage this body to continue to find ways to solve problems, work together, and show that, when it comes to unity around our veterans, there is not an inch of daylight between the two sides of this body. Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from the Second District of Maine (Mr. Poliquin). He is from the metropolis of Oakland, Maine. Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for recognizing that Oakland, Maine, is a central Maine metropolis, and I thank the chairman for quickly bringing this very important bipartisan bill to the floor. I want to salute the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Young), the Congressman who has been in the lead with respect to this issue. Mr. Speaker, when I was a boy growing up in central Maine, our brave men and women in uniform who were returning from the battlefield in Vietnam were not treated well. I remember those days, and a lot of us also do. I believe our country, Mr. Speaker, has learned a lesson that that shall never happen again. Sadly, Mr. Speaker, today, 22 veterans commit suicide in our country every day, and the majority of those veterans have served in Vietnam. When one of our veterans, any veteran, is in trouble and they call the crisis hotline, we need to make sure that those phones are answered and the individuals on the other end, our heroes, are not hung up on, inadvertently or otherwise. We need to make sure we take care of our veterans. Mr. Speaker, in the State of Maine, we love our veterans. The character of our country is measured in great part by how we treat our veterans. I am thrilled to cosponsor this bill because it will help correct this issue. I would like to close, Mr. Speaker, with a quote from George Washington: ``The willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in any war, no matter how justified, shall be directly proportional to how they perceive how the veterans of earlier wars were treated and appreciated by their nation.'' Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Young for bringing this important legislation to the floor. I encourage everybody in this Chamber, Republicans and Democrats, to get behind this terrific bipartisan piece of legislation. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. Gabbard), who is also a member of the Hawaiian National Guard and an Iraq war veteran. Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, not too long ago, I was woken up abruptly one morning by a text message from a friend of mine that I had both served and trained with in the Army. His message was alarming because it came after many months of struggle in his life: nightmares, posttraumatic stress, many late nights staying up self-medicating with alcohol, troubles with his family, and a constant desire coming from him that the only way he knew how to deal with the challenges that he had was to deploy again and again and again. Finally, he was home and he got to a point where he felt comfortable asking for help. He summoned up the courage one day--he was at his civilian job during the day--finally to call his local VA hotline, and he got a voice-mail. This strong, battle-worn, courageous infantryman broke down in tears and ran out of the office building where he worked. His frustration and disappointment and even heartbreak was palpable that, even as he had spent so many years of his life answering the call to duty again and again and again, sacrificing so much, at that one moment that he made that very difficult decision to finally ask for help, no one was there. No one answered the phone. He detailed this in a text message to me. I immediately called him and spent a couple of hours on the phone with him talking things through. I thanked him--he said: Sorry for bothering you about this-- but I thanked him for making that call and letting me know what happened to him, giving me the opportunity to not only see how I could help him as my friend, but to see how we collectively can take action to help all of our brothers and sisters, unfortunately, many of whom are going through challenges that are not so different from his. Just a few days ago, a veteran in my district called the Veterans Crisis Line for the first time. Her psychologist had encouraged her to place a test call to the crisis line so she could feel comfortable with how it worked, she could see how it worked, and she would feel comfortable making that phone call in the future if she got to a point where she needed it at a point of emergency. So she called that number with her psychologist and they waited on hold for 24 minutes. It took 24 minutes before someone finally answered the phone. Now, I can tell you, when I call the airlines to change a reservation or when I call the bank to deal with an issue, I get frustrated when I get placed on hold for 5 minutes or 10 minutes. I feel like this is a waste of my time and I am going to hang up the phone. It is virtually impossible for most people to understand that, when someone has a bottle of prescription drugs in their hand or a gun or they are on the verge of taking their own life and they are sitting on hold for 24 minutes, what do we think the outcome will be? Sometimes we are seeing that the shortcomings and gaps of the VA and these help lines have been filled by phone call networks that have been slapped together by troops, whether they are soldiers or marines or airmen or sailors, who are looking out for their buddy, doing what they can to make sure that everyone has got each other's phone numbers so that, if you get to that point where you need help, you have got someone to call who is going to answer the phone, who is going to talk you down from the edge, helping to make sure that, after they have survived the rigors and horrors of war and combat, they have a chance to live in peace when they come home. With the average of 22 veterans who go through all of that and who do come home yet are still taking their lives every single day, we cannot afford to give up. We cannot afford 24 minutes on hold. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Hawaii an additional 30 seconds. Ms. GABBARD. This is why I strongly support and have cosponsored this critical piece of legislation, and I commend my colleague from Iowa for introducing it, H.R. 5392, the No Veterans Crisis Line Call Should Go Unanswered Act. This bill establishes quality standards and metrics to make sure that every call to the Veterans Crisis Line is answered quickly and by a live trained person. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in passing this legislation today because the lives of our veterans depend on it. Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation. I thank my colleagues who came to the floor to speak in support of H.R. 5392. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I, too, urge all of my colleagues on my side of the aisle to please join me in supporting this particular piece of legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Miller) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5392. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. [[Page H5891]] The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [House] [Pages H5888-H5891] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NO VETERANS CRISIS LINE CALL SHOULD GO UNANSWERED ACT Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 5392) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to improve the Veterans Crisis Line. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 5392 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``No Veterans Crisis Line Call Should Go Unanswered Act''. SEC. 2. IMPROVEMENTS TO VETERANS CRISIS LINE. (a) Quality Assurance Document.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall develop a quality assurance document to use in carrying out the Veterans Crisis Line. Such document shall-- (1) outline clearly defined and measurable performance indicators and objectives to improve the responsiveness and performance of the Veterans Crisis Line, including at backup call centers; (2) include quantifiable timeframes to meet designated objectives to assist the Secretary in tracking the progress of the Veterans Crisis Line and such backup call centers in meeting the performance indicators and objectives specified in paragraph (1); and (3) with respect to such timeframes and objectives, be consistent with guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget. (b) Plan.--The Secretary shall develop a plan to ensure that each telephone call, text message, and other communications received by the Veterans Crisis Line, including at backup call centers, is answered in a timely manner by a person, consistent with the guidance established by the American Association of Suicidology. Such plan shall include guidelines to carry out periodic testing of the Veterans Crisis Line, including such backup centers, during each fiscal year to identify and correct any problems in a timely manner. (c) Submission.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Senate a report containing the document developed under subsection (a) and the plan developed under subsection (b). (d) Veterans Crisis Line Defined.--In this section, the term ``Veterans Crisis Line'' means the toll-free hotline for veterans established under section 1720F(h) of title 38, United States Code. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Miller) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Takano) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. General Leave Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to add extraneous material. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5392, the No Veterans Crisis Line Should Go Unanswered Act. The Department of Veterans Affairs established the Veterans Crisis Line to ensure that any veteran that was contemplating suicide would be able to call for help no matter the time and no matter the circumstance. Over time, VCL's mission has expanded to include veterans facing all manners of personal emergencies, and the Veterans Crisis Line services have expanded to include a chat service and a texting operation. Yet the crisis line purpose has remained the same: to provide a place where veterans facing crisis would be able to get the help that they need any time of day or night. However, earlier this year, the VA Inspector General found that some calls to the crisis line were routed to backup crisis centers and ultimately sent to voice mail and that other line callers did not receive the immediate assistance that they desperately needed. The IG also noted that VA failed to provide a directive or handbook detailing the guidance necessary for the proper Veterans Crisis Line processes and procedures, and it failed to provide adequate orientation and training to crisis line staff, it failed to monitor contracted backup call centers, and experienced a number of quality assurance gaps. Though VA has assured us that these issues have been addressed and will never happen again, the risk of leaving a veteran in the midst of a crisis alone and without help is unacceptable to any Member of this body. H.R. 5392 would require that VA develops a quality assurance document that includes clearly defined and measurable performance standards with appropriate timelines and benchmarks to improve responsiveness and outcomes for the crisis line mainline and contracted backup call centers. It would also require VA to develop a plan to ensure that each telephone call, each text message, or other communications received by the crisis line mainline or at a contracted backup call center is answered in a timely manner by an appropriate, qualified live person, consistent with the guidance established by the American Association of Suicidology.

I encourage everybody in this Chamber, Republicans and Democrats, to get behind this terrific bipartisan piece of legislation. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. Gabbard), who is also a member of the Hawaiian National Guard and an Iraq war veteran. Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, not too long ago, I was woken up abruptly one morning by a text message from a friend of mine that I had both served and trained with in the Army. His message was alarming because it came after many months of struggle in his life: nightmares, posttraumatic stress, many late nights staying up self-medicating with alcohol, troubles with his family, and a constant desire coming from him that the only way he knew how to deal with the challenges that he had was to deploy again and again and again. Finally, he was home and he got to a point where he felt comfortable asking for help. He summoned up the courage one day--he was at his civilian job during the day--finally to call his local VA hotline, and he got a voice-mail. This strong, battle-worn, courageous infantryman broke down in tears and ran out of the office building where he worked. His frustration and disappointment and even heartbreak was palpable that, even as he had spent so many years of his life answering the call to duty again and again and again, sacrificing so much, at that one moment that he made that very difficult decision to finally ask for help, no one was there. No one answered the phone. He detailed this in a text message to me. I immediately called him and spent a couple of hours on the phone with him talking things through. I thanked him--he said: Sorry for bothering you about this-- but I thanked him for making that call and letting me know what happened to him, giving me the opportunity to not only see how I could help him as my friend, but to see how we collectively can take action to help all of our brothers and sisters, unfortunately, many of whom are going through challenges that are not so different from his. Just a few days ago, a veteran in my district called the Veterans Crisis Line for the first time. Her psychologist had encouraged her to place a test call to the crisis line so she could feel comfortable with how it worked, she could see how it worked, and she would feel comfortable making that phone call in the future if she got to a point where she needed it at a point of emergency. So she called that number with her psychologist and they waited on hold for 24 minutes. It took 24 minutes before someone finally answered the phone. Now, I can tell you, when I call the airlines to change a reservation or when I call the bank to deal with an issue, I get frustrated when I get placed on hold for 5 minutes or 10 minutes. I feel like this is a waste of my time and I am going to hang up the phone. It is virtually impossible for most people to understand that, when someone has a bottle of prescription drugs in their hand or a gun or they are on the verge of taking their own life and they are sitting on hold for 24 minutes, what do we think the outcome will be? Sometimes we are seeing that the shortcomings and gaps of the VA and these help lines have been filled by phone call networks that have been slapped together by troops, whether they are soldiers or marines or airmen or sailors, who are looking out for their buddy, doing what they can to make sure that everyone has got each other's phone numbers so that, if you get to that point where you need help, you have got someone to call who is going to answer the phone, who is going to talk you down from the edge, helping to make sure that, after they have survived the rigors and horrors of war and combat, they have a chance to live in peace when they come home. With the average of 22 veterans who go through all of that and who do come home yet are still taking their lives every single day, we cannot afford to give up. We cannot afford 24 minutes on hold. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Hawaii an additional 30 seconds. Ms. GABBARD. This is why I strongly support and have cosponsored this critical piece of legislation, and I commend my colleague from Iowa for introducing it, H.R. 5392, the No Veterans Crisis Line Call Should Go Unanswered Act. This bill establishes quality standards and metrics to make sure that every call to the Veterans Crisis Line is answered quickly and by a live trained person. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in passing this legislation today because the lives of our veterans depend on it. Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation. I thank my colleagues who came to the floor to speak in support of H.R. 5392. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I, too, urge all of my colleagues on my side of the aisle to please join me in supporting this particular piece of legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Miller) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5392. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. [[Page H5891]] The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [House] [Pages H5888-H5891] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NO VETERANS CRISIS LINE CALL SHOULD GO UNANSWERED ACT Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 5392) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to improve the Veterans Crisis Line. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 5392 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``No Veterans Crisis Line Call Should Go Unanswered Act''. SEC. 2. IMPROVEMENTS TO VETERANS CRISIS LINE. (a) Quality Assurance Document.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall develop a quality assurance document to use in carrying out the Veterans Crisis Line. Such document shall-- (1) outline clearly defined and measurable performance indicators and objectives to improve the responsiveness and performance of the Veterans Crisis Line, including at backup call centers; (2) include quantifiable timeframes to meet designated objectives to assist the Secretary in tracking the progress of the Veterans Crisis Line and such backup call centers in meeting the performance indicators and objectives specified in paragraph (1); and (3) with respect to such timeframes and objectives, be consistent with guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget. (b) Plan.--The Secretary shall develop a plan to ensure that each telephone call, text message, and other communications received by the Veterans Crisis Line, including at backup call centers, is answered in a timely manner by a person, consistent with the guidance established by the American Association of Suicidology. Such plan shall include guidelines to carry out periodic testing of the Veterans Crisis Line, including such backup centers, during each fiscal year to identify and correct any problems in a timely manner. (c) Submission.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Senate a report containing the document developed under subsection (a) and the plan developed under subsection (b). (d) Veterans Crisis Line Defined.--In this section, the term ``Veterans Crisis Line'' means the toll-free hotline for veterans established under section 1720F(h) of title 38, United States Code. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Miller) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Takano) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. General Leave Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to add extraneous material. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5392, the No Veterans Crisis Line Should Go Unanswered Act. The Department of Veterans Affairs established the Veterans Crisis Line to ensure that any veteran that was contemplating suicide would be able to call for help no matter the time and no matter the circumstance. Over time, VCL's mission has expanded to include veterans facing all manners of personal emergencies, and the Veterans Crisis Line services have expanded to include a chat service and a texting operation. Yet the crisis line purpose has remained the same: to provide a place where veterans facing crisis would be able to get the help that they need any time of day or night. However, earlier this year, the VA Inspector General found that some calls to the crisis line were routed to backup crisis centers and ultimately sent to voice mail and that other line callers did not receive the immediate assistance that they desperately needed. The IG also noted that VA failed to provide a directive or handbook detailing the guidance necessary for the proper Veterans Crisis Line processes and procedures, and it failed to provide adequate orientation and training to crisis line staff, it failed to monitor contracted backup call centers, and experienced a number of quality assurance gaps. Though VA has assured us that these issues have been addressed and will never happen again, the risk of leaving a veteran in the midst of a crisis alone and without help is unacceptable to any Member of this body. H.R. 5392 would require that VA develops a quality assurance document that includes clearly defined and measurable performance standards with appropriate timelines and benchmarks to improve responsiveness and outcomes for the crisis line mainline and contracted backup call centers. It would also require VA to develop a plan to ensure that each telephone call, each text message, or other communications received by the crisis line mainline or at a contracted backup call center is answered in a timely manner by an appropriate, qualified live person, consistent with the guidance established by the American Association of Suicidology. This bill is sponsored by my friend and colleague, Congressman David Young from Iowa. I want to thank him for his efforts and his leadership on sponsoring this very important and, to some, very simple fix to something that needs to be taken care of. Nothing could be more important than guaranteed timely access to the veterans' services and support that they need in an emergency situation. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this commonsense piece of legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today regarding H.R. 5392, the No Veterans Crisis Line Call Should Go Unanswered Act. The Veterans Crisis Line actually provides three ways veterans can access help when they are in crisis. Veterans, servicemembers, and their loved ones can call the 1-800 number, send a text message, or chat online to receive free, confidential support 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, even if they are not registered with VA or enrolled in VA health care. The responders at the Veterans Crisis Line are especially trained and experienced in helping veterans of all ages and circumstances, from those coping with mental health issues that were never addressed to recent veterans dealing with relationships or the transition back to civilian life. Since its launch in 2007 through May 2016, the Veterans Crisis Line has answered over 2.3 million calls and initiated the dispatch of emergency services to callers in imminent crisis nearly 61,000 times. This bill requires improvements to the Veterans Crisis Line by having the [[Page H5889]] VA create quality assurance guidelines that will include clearly defined and measurable performance indicators and objectives to improve the responsiveness and performance of the Veterans Crisis Line. The bill also requires the VA to develop a plan to ensure that each telephone call, text message, and other communications received by the Veterans Crisis Line is answered in a timely manner by a person, consistent with the guidance established by the American Association of Suicidology. As Suicide Prevention Awareness Month comes to a close, Congress must take these necessary steps to improve the Veterans Crisis Line for all veterans who depend on it. I support this legislation, and I urge its passage. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MILLER of Florida. I am proud to introduce the sponsor of this important piece of legislation. The gentleman is from the Third District of Iowa, from the small town of Van Meter, Iowa, home to Bob ``The Heater From Van Meter.'' Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Young). Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, I introduced the No Veterans Crisis Line Call Should Go Unanswered Act, H.R. 5392, a bipartisan piece of legislation, doing this after hearing from a constituent who called the Veterans Crisis Line for help but never was connected to a live person. Though I have spoken on the floor about this issue before, as well as others, I remain deeply concerned with the many struggles and challenges our veterans face as they transition from Active Duty to civilian life and beyond. These are brave women and men who have sacrificed much in service to their country. Now, our servicemembers have given up holidays, missed birthdays, weddings, and other important life events of their family members, communities, and friends. They have been mobilized or deployed to some of the most volatile regions of the world for months on end, and the list goes on. They are our friends, family, and neighbors, and they make significant sacrifices because they believe in this great Nation and strive to protect the freedoms we have guaranteed. Now, unfortunately, more and more veterans carry deep scars-- emotional war wounds--ones we cannot see. These men and women deserve our support. Now, our country has a responsibility to ensure our brave veterans not only have the benefits that they have earned, but have access to services and resources intended to help them through the storms of life. Mr. Speaker, it is hard for anyone to ask for help sometimes, and the sad fact is today and every day this week, 20 veterans will take their lives. So it is unacceptable for any veteran who is reaching out for help and a listening ear to be turned away unanswered, especially when help may mean the difference between life and death. That is why I introduced, with bipartisan support from my colleagues, legislation to make critical improvements to the Veterans Crisis Line. This bipartisan bill requires the VA to create and implement documented plans to improve responsiveness and performance of the crisis line--an important step to ensure our veterans have unimpeded access to the mental health resources that they need. Even the VA has acknowledged these problems, which were also documented in two separate investigations conducted by the VA Office of Inspector General and the Government Accountability Office. This bill drives accountability within the Veterans Crisis Line, ensuring any call or text or messages are answered, and ensuring the quality processes, including those guiding staff training, are addressed and provided to Congress. {time} 1615 Our men and women in uniform have answered our Nation's call, and we must work to do better and ensure their calls do not go unanswered. Mr. Speaker, I want to especially thank Chairman Miller and his staff for working so closely with me on this bill. It is a pleasure serving with him, and his leadership on these issues will be missed in his retirement. September is National Suicide Prevention Awareness Month. It is only fitting that we pass this bill today to help our veterans. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Walz), my colleague and friend, the highest ranking noncommissioned officer to serve in Congress. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Takano) for his unwavering work for the care of our veterans. And to the chairman, as has been noted so often, at a time when partisanship seems to win the day or be on the news, I can assure him that the care of our Nation's veterans knows no political boundaries, and the work that has been done should be noted. I also want to thank the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Young) for bringing this bill forward. Like everything in life, there is a symmetry to things, and I think the story of how we got to this point might be well spoken or told. The gentleman represents the Third District of Iowa, the new one. Back in 2006, there was a young Army Reservist named Joshua Omvig, who grew up in a small community in Iowa, literally down the road from where they filmed ``Field of Dreams.'' He returned from Iraq a week before Thanksgiving in 2006 and joined his family at that most American of all holidays to be back together. That evening of Thanksgiving, Joshua took his own life in front of his mother. The crushing loss of a son, the crushing loss of a son of the Midwest was overwhelming. But the Omvigs did something that Americans do and something that this Nation always does. They turned their grief into action. They went to their Congressman at that time in the old Third District, Lieutenant Colonel Leonard Boswell, himself a decorated Vietnam veteran and helicopter pilot. They put together what then became the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act. This was back in 2007, when nobody was talking about 20 veterans a day and no one was talking about mental health and no one was talking much about transition. We were in the heart of the Iraq war. We were in Afghanistan. Our veterans were coming back, and, rightfully noted, we were unprepared for them. In this piece of legislation, there are a couple of sections in here that are very clear on what Mr. Young's legislation does--exactly what it should do and what this Congress should do--provide oversight and improve on legislation. Section 1720F said that the VA would establish 24-hour mental health care. In carrying out the comprehensive program, the Secretary shall provide for mental health care availability to veterans on a 24-hour basis. It would establish a hotline to carry this out, and the Secretary would provide a toll-free hotline for veterans to be staffed by appropriately trained mental health professionals. And for those who don't think that that was needed, since that time, 2.5 million calls have been made to that hotline, 300,000 online chats, and 55,000 texts. When someone calls that line, they are at a breaking point. One of our warriors is at a point where they had nowhere else to turn. The intent of this Congress and this Nation--not Democrat, not Republican--was to provide them the resources and the trained personnel necessary. What was noted in a GAO report, what Mr. Young has noted, and what this committee has noted is that the VA was not fulfilling fully what they should have. If one veteran falls through the cracks, we have failed. I don't care if 2.5 million were picked up. If 2.5 million plus one, and that last one was not picked up, we have failed. Mr. Young's piece of legislation is simple, eloquent, asks the VA to do what they are supposed to do, and then do what should expected: report back to Congress so that we can provide our oversight ability. I want to thank the chairman, the ranking member, and this committee for doing exactly what we are supposed to do. We are supposed to make sure that the VA fulfills the commitment that the United States and its citizens want to care for every single veteran that is out there. This was a smart piece of legislation. It was championed by the parents of a warrior who took his own life. [[Page H5890]] And keep in mind, when this was championed, we did not even bury our veterans who took their own lives with military honors because it was still something we didn't talk about. It was believed that they weren't casualties of war. In the 10 years since that time, we have made strides, we have made progress, and we understand that the cost of war continues on. I want to thank Mr. Young for continuing the legacy that comes out of Iowa, the deep care for those that serve in our heartland, continuing the bipartisan legacy of the Third District of Iowa to improve on a really smart, needed piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this, and I encourage this body to continue to find ways to solve problems, work together, and show that, when it comes to unity around our veterans, there is not an inch of daylight between the two sides of this body. Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from the Second District of Maine (Mr. Poliquin). He is from the metropolis of Oakland, Maine. Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for recognizing that Oakland, Maine, is a central Maine metropolis, and I thank the chairman for quickly bringing this very important bipartisan bill to the floor. I want to salute the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Young), the Congressman who has been in the lead with respect to this issue. Mr. Speaker, when I was a boy growing up in central Maine, our brave men and women in uniform who were returning from the battlefield in Vietnam were not treated well. I remember those days, and a lot of us also do. I believe our country, Mr. Speaker, has learned a lesson that that shall never happen again. Sadly, Mr. Speaker, today, 22 veterans commit suicide in our country every day, and the majority of those veterans have served in Vietnam. When one of our veterans, any veteran, is in trouble and they call the crisis hotline, we need to make sure that those phones are answered and the individuals on the other end, our heroes, are not hung up on, inadvertently or otherwise. We need to make sure we take care of our veterans. Mr. Speaker, in the State of Maine, we love our veterans. The character of our country is measured in great part by how we treat our veterans. I am thrilled to cosponsor this bill because it will help correct this issue. I would like to close, Mr. Speaker, with a quote from George Washington: ``The willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in any war, no matter how justified, shall be directly proportional to how they perceive how the veterans of earlier wars were treated and appreciated by their nation.'' Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Young for bringing this important legislation to the floor. I encourage everybody in this Chamber, Republicans and Democrats, to get behind this terrific bipartisan piece of legislation. Mr. TAKANO.

responsiveness and performance of the veterans crisis line. the bill also requires the va to develop a plan to ensure that each telephone call, text message, and other communications received by the veterans crisis line is answered in a timely manner by a person, consistent with the guidance established by the american association of suicidology. as suicide prevention awareness month comes to a close, congress must take these necessary steps to improve the veterans crisis line for all veterans who depend on it. i support this legislation, and i urge its passage. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. miller of florida. i am proud to introduce the sponsor of this important piece of legislation. the gentleman is from the third district of iowa, from the small town of van meter, iowa, home to bob ``the heater from van meter.'' mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from iowa (mr. young). mr. young of iowa. mr. speaker, earlier this year, i introduced the no veterans crisis line call should go unanswered act, h.r. 5392, a bipartisan piece of legislation, doing this after hearing from a constituent who called the veterans crisis line for help but never was connected to a live person. though i have spoken on the floor about this issue before, as well as others, i remain deeply concerned with the many struggles and challenges our veterans face as they transition from active duty to civilian life and beyond. these are brave women and men who have sacrificed much in service to their country. now, our servicemembers have given up holidays, missed birthdays, weddings, and other important life events of their family members, communities, and friends. they have been mobilized or deployed to some of the most volatile regions of the world for months on end, and the list goes on. they are our friends, family, and neighbors, and they make significant sacrifices because they believe in this great nation and strive to protect the freedoms we have guaranteed. now, unfortunately, more and more veterans carry deep scars-- emotional war wounds--ones we cannot see. these men and women deserve our support. now, our country has a responsibility to ensure our brave veterans not only have the benefits that they have earned, but have access to services and resources intended to help them through the storms of life. mr. speaker, it is hard for anyone to ask for help sometimes, and the sad fact is today and every day this week, 20 veterans will take their lives. so it is unacceptable for any veteran who is reaching out for help and a listening ear to be turned away unanswered, especially when help may mean the difference between life and death. that is why i introduced, with bipartisan support from my colleagues, legislation to make critical improvements to the veterans crisis line. this bipartisan bill requires the va to create and implement documented plans to improve responsiveness and performance of the crisis line--an important step to ensure our veterans have unimpeded access to the mental health resources that they need. even the va has acknowledged these problems, which were also documented in two separate investigations conducted by the va office of inspector general and the government accountability office. this bill drives accountability within the veterans crisis line, ensuring any call or text or messages are answered, and ensuring the quality processes, including those guiding staff training, are addressed and provided to congress. {time} 1615 our men and women in uniform have answered our nation's call, and we must work to do better and ensure their calls do not go unanswered. mr. speaker, i want to especially thank chairman miller and his staff for working so closely with me on this bill. it is a pleasure serving with him, and his leadership on these issues will be missed in his retirement. september is national suicide prevention awareness month. it is only fitting that we pass this bill today to help our veterans. i urge my colleagues to support this bill. mr. takano. mr. speaker, i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from minnesota (mr. walz), my colleague and friend, the highest ranking noncommissioned officer to serve in congress. mr. walz. mr. speaker, i thank the gentleman from california (mr. takano) for his unwavering work for the care of our veterans. and to the chairman, as has been noted so often, at a time when partisanship seems to win the day or be on the news, i can assure him that the care of our nation's veterans knows no political boundaries, and the work that has been done should be noted. i also want to thank the gentleman from iowa (mr. young) for bringing this bill forward. like everything in life, there is a symmetry to things, and i think the story of how we got to this point might be well spoken or told. the gentleman represents the third district of iowa, the new one. back in 2006, there was a young army reservist named joshua omvig, who grew up in a small community in iowa, literally down the road from where they filmed ``field of dreams.'' he returned from iraq a week before thanksgiving in 2006 and joined his family at that most american of all holidays to be back together. that evening of thanksgiving, joshua took his own life in front of his mother. the crushing loss of a son, the crushing loss of a son of the midwest was overwhelming. but the omvigs did something that americans do and something that this nation always does. they turned their grief into action. they went to their congressman at that time in the old third district, lieutenant colonel leonard boswell, himself a decorated vietnam veteran and helicopter pilot. they put together what then became the joshua omvig veterans suicide prevention act. this was back in 2007, when nobody was talking about 20 veterans a day and no one was talking about mental health and no one was talking much about transition. we were in the heart of the iraq war. we were in afghanistan. our veterans were coming back, and, rightfully noted, we were unprepared for them. in this piece of legislation, there are a couple of sections in here that are very clear on what mr. young's legislation does--exactly what it should do and what this congress should do--provide oversight and improve on legislation. section 1720f said that the va would establish 24-hour mental health care. in carrying out the comprehensive program, the secretary shall provide for mental health care availability to veterans on a 24-hour basis. it would establish a hotline to carry this out, and the secretary would provide a toll-free hotline for veterans to be staffed by appropriately trained mental health professionals. and for those who don't think that that was needed, since that time, 2.5 million calls have been made to that hotline, 300,000 online chats, and 55,000 texts. when someone calls that line, they are at a breaking point. one of our warriors is at a point where they had nowhere else to turn. the intent of this congress and this nation--not democrat, not republican--was to provide them the resources and the trained personnel necessary. what was noted in a gao report, what mr. young has noted, and what this committee has noted is that the va was not fulfilling fully what they should have. if one veteran falls through the cracks, we have failed. i don't care if 2.5 million were picked up. if 2.5 million plus one, and that last one was not picked up, we have failed. mr. young's piece of legislation is simple, eloquent, asks the va to do what they are supposed to do, and then do what should expected: report back to congress so that we can provide our oversight ability. i want to thank the chairman, the ranking member, and this committee for doing exactly what we are supposed to do. we are supposed to make sure that the va fulfills the commitment that the united states and its citizens want to care for every single veteran that is out there. this was a smart piece of legislation. it was championed by the parents of a warrior who took his own life. [[page h5890]] and keep in mind, when this was championed, we did not even bury our veterans who took their own lives with military honors because it was still something we didn't talk about. it was believed that they weren't casualties of war. in the 10 years since that time, we have made strides, we have made progress, and we understand that the cost of war continues on. i want to thank mr. young for continuing the legacy that comes out of iowa, the deep care for those that serve in our heartland, continuing the bipartisan legacy of the third district of iowa to improve on a really smart, needed piece of legislation. mr. speaker, i encourage my colleagues to support this, and i encourage this body to continue to find ways to solve problems, work together, and show that, when it comes to unity around our veterans, there is not an inch of daylight between the two sides of this body. mr. miller of florida. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from the second district of maine (mr. poliquin). he is from the metropolis of oakland, maine. mr. poliquin. mr. speaker, i thank the chairman for recognizing that oakland, maine, is a central maine metropolis, and i thank the chairman for quickly bringing this very important bipartisan bill to the floor. i want to salute the gentleman from iowa (mr. young), the congressman who has been in the lead with respect to this issue. mr. speaker, when i was a boy growing up in central maine, our brave men and women in uniform who were returning from the battlefield in vietnam were not treated well. i remember those days, and a lot of us also do. i believe our country, mr. speaker, has learned a lesson that that shall never happen again. sadly, mr. speaker, today, 22 veterans commit suicide in our country every day, and the majority of those veterans have served in vietnam. when one of our veterans, any veteran, is in trouble and they call the crisis hotline, we need to make sure that those phones are answered and the individuals on the other end, our heroes, are not hung up on, inadvertently or otherwise. we need to make sure we take care of our veterans. mr. speaker, in the state of maine, we love our veterans. the character of our country is measured in great part by how we treat our veterans. i am thrilled to cosponsor this bill because it will help correct this issue. i would like to close, mr. speaker, with a quote from george washington: ``the willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in any war, no matter how justified, shall be directly proportional to how they perceive how the veterans of earlier wars were treated and appreciated by their nation.'' mr. speaker, i thank mr. young for bringing this important legislation to the floor. i encourage everybody in this chamber, republicans and democrats, to get behind this terrific bipartisan piece of legislation. mr. takano. mr. speaker, i yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from hawaii (ms. gabbard), who is also a member of the hawaiian national guard and an iraq war veteran. ms. gabbard. mr. speaker, not too long ago, i was woken up abruptly one morning by a text message from a friend of mine that i had both served and trained with in the army. his message was alarming because it came after many months of struggle in his life: nightmares, posttraumatic stress, many late nights staying up self-medicating with alcohol, troubles with his family, and a constant desire coming from him that the only way he knew how to deal with the challenges that he had was to deploy again and again and again. finally, he was home and he got to a point where he felt comfortable asking for help. he summoned up the courage one day--he was at his civilian job during the day--finally to call his local va hotline, and he got a voice-mail. this strong, battle-worn, courageous infantryman broke down in tears and ran out of the office building where he worked. his frustration and disappointment and even heartbreak was palpable that, even as he had spent so many years of his life answering the call to duty again and again and again, sacrificing so much, at that one moment that he made that very difficult decision to finally ask for help, no one was there. no one answered the phone. he detailed this in a text message to me. i immediately called him and spent a couple of hours on the phone with him talking things through. i thanked him--he said: sorry for bothering you about this-- but i thanked him for making that call and letting me know what happened to him, giving me the opportunity to not only see how i could help him as my friend, but to see how we collectively can take action to help all of our brothers and sisters, unfortunately, many of whom are going through challenges that are not so different from his. just a few days ago, a veteran in my district called the veterans crisis line for the first time. her psychologist had encouraged her to place a test call to the crisis line so she could feel comfortable with how it worked, she could see how it worked, and she would feel comfortable making that phone call in the future if she got to a point where she needed it at a point of emergency. so she called that number with her psychologist and they waited on hold for 24 minutes. it took 24 minutes before someone finally answered the phone. now, i can tell you, when i call the airlines to change a reservation or when i call the bank to deal with an issue, i get frustrated when i get placed on hold for 5 minutes or 10 minutes. i feel like this is a waste of my time and i am going to hang up the phone. it is virtually impossible for most people to understand that, when someone has a bottle of prescription drugs in their hand or a gun or they are on the verge of taking their own life and they are sitting on hold for 24 minutes, what do we think the outcome will be? sometimes we are seeing that the shortcomings and gaps of the va and these help lines have been filled by phone call networks that have been slapped together by troops, whether they are soldiers or marines or airmen or sailors, who are looking out for their buddy, doing what they can to make sure that everyone has got each other's phone numbers so that, if you get to that point where you need help, you have got someone to call who is going to answer the phone, who is going to talk you down from the edge, helping to make sure that, after they have survived the rigors and horrors of war and combat, they have a chance to live in peace when they come home. with the average of 22 veterans who go through all of that and who do come home yet are still taking their lives every single day, we cannot afford to give up. we cannot afford 24 minutes on hold. the speaker pro tempore. the time of the gentlewoman has expired. mr. takano. mr. speaker, i yield the gentlewoman from hawaii an additional 30 seconds. ms. gabbard. this is why i strongly support and have cosponsored this critical piece of legislation, and i commend my colleague from iowa for introducing it, h.r. 5392, the no veterans crisis line call should go unanswered act. this bill establishes quality standards and metrics to make sure that every call to the veterans crisis line is answered quickly and by a live trained person. i urge all of my colleagues to join me in passing this legislation today because the lives of our veterans depend on it. mr. miller of florida. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. takano. mr. speaker, i ask all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation. i thank my colleagues who came to the floor to speak in support of h.r. 5392. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. miller of florida. mr. speaker, i, too, urge all of my colleagues on my side of the aisle to please join me in supporting this particular piece of legislation. i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from florida (mr. miller) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 5392. the question was taken. the speaker pro tempore. in the opinion of the chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. mr. young of iowa. mr. speaker, on that i demand the yeas and nays. the yeas and nays were ordered.

or ``(iii) if a physician is not physically present in the emergency department at the time a veteran is transferred, a qualified medical person (as defined by the Secretary in regulations) has signed a certification described in clause (ii) after a physician, in consultation with the person, has made the determination described in such clause, and subsequently countersigns the certification;

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Miller) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Takano) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. {time} 1630 General Leave Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to add extraneous material. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 3216, the Veterans Emergency Treatment--or VET--Act. It should be common sense, if a veteran is in need of medical attention and arrives on the grounds of a Department of Veterans Affairs medical facility, that veteran would be seen, assessed, and treated immediately. However, recently, a veteran who experienced a medical emergency in Washington State traveled as far as the parking lot of his local VA emergency room before finding he could go no further, and he called the VA and asked for help in making it through the doors. He was told by the VA staff who answered his call that he should hang up and dial 911. To hear the VA staff express an unwillingness or an apprehension about assisting a veteran in the midst of his having a medical emergency in its own parking lot is not only unacceptable, it is emblematic of how much the VA has lost its way. H.R. 3216 would require the VA to determine whether a medical emergency exists among any enrolled veteran who presents at a VA facility and would prohibit the VA from transferring a medically unstable veteran unless the veteran submits a written request to be transferred or it finds that it is clinically unnecessary. It would also prohibit the VA from taking an adverse action against any employee who refuses to authorize a transfer or who prevents the VA from delaying needed care by inquiring about payment method or insurance status. This legislation would help ensure that, in the case of a medical emergency, a veteran's health remains the number one priority, which is where it should always belong. This bill is sponsored by my friend and colleague, Congressman Dan Newhouse from Washington State. I am grateful to him for sponsoring this measure, and I urge all of my colleagues to join me in support of it. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in regard to H.R. 3216, the Veterans Emergency Treatment Act. This bill requires that, if an enrolled veteran in the VA requests treatment at a VA Emergency Department, he or she will get that examination or treatment whether or not it is related to a service- connected condition. It also prohibits the VA from transferring a patient to another facility without its having the written consent of that veteran unless a physician deems the transfer medically necessary. It further prohibits the VA from taking adverse action against any VA employee in his refusing to authorize the transfer of an enrolled veteran if it is contrary to the veteran's wishes. The purpose of this legislation is to have the VA follow the Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act. Mr. Speaker, I support this bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from the Fourth District of Washington State (Mr. Newhouse), the sponsor of this piece of legislation. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding me some time to speak on this important bill. Mr. Speaker, President Abraham Lincoln once famously charged all Americans with the responsibility ``to care for him who shall have borne the battle.'' If you speak with veterans today, you will learn that the quality of health care provided to them, many times, does not reflect this duty. In recent years, we have learned of multiple incidents in which the VA has failed to provide emergency care to veterans in need. In addition to the incidents that happened in my home State, another notable incident occurred in New Mexico, in the year 2014, when a veteran collapsed in the cafeteria of a VA facility, and he ultimately died when the VA refused to transport him 500 yards across the campus to the ER. My legislation will ensure that every enrolled veteran who arrives at the Emergency Department of a VA medical facility and who seeks emergency treatment is assessed and treated in order to prevent further injury or death. This is accomplished by applying the statutory requirements of the Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act, or EMTALA, to emergency care that is furnished by the VA to our veterans. This is a 1986 Federal statute that grants every individual a Federal right to emergency care. It requires a hospital to conduct a medical examination to determine if an emergency medical condition exists. If one does, then the hospital must either stabilize the patient or effectuate a proper transfer at the patient's request. Currently, VA hospitals are considered to be non-participating hospitals and, therefore, are not obligated to fulfill the requirements of EMTALA. The VET Act will remove the non-participating designation from VA hospitals and require them to fulfill the requirements of EMTALA, just as every other hospital does. Mr. Speaker, I urge the House to support and pass H.R. 3216. It is time we ensure that our veterans receive proper medical treatment during emergency medical situations, all without requiring additional spending. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 3216, the Veterans Emergency Treatment Act. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to support Mr. Newhouse's piece of legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Miller) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3216. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [House] [Pages H5891-H5892] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] VETERANS EMERGENCY TREATMENT ACT Mr. MILLER of Florida.

The hospital shall take all reasonable steps to secure the written informed consent of such veteran (or individual) to refuse such transfer. ``(c) Restriction of Transfers Until Veteran Stabilized.-- (1) If an enrolled veteran at a medical facility of the Department has an emergency medical condition that has not been stabilized, the Secretary may not transfer the veteran to another medical facility of the Department or a non- Department facility unless-- ``(A)(i) the veteran (or a legally responsible individual acting on behalf of the veteran), after being informed of the obligation of the Secretary under this section and of the risk of transfer, requests in writing a transfer to another medical facility; ``(ii) a physician has signed a certification (including a summary of the risks and benefits) that, based upon the information available at the time of transfer, the medical benefits reasonably expected from the provision of appropriate medical treatment at another medical facility outweigh the increased risks to the veteran and, in the case of labor, to the unborn child from effecting the transfer; or ``(iii) if a physician is not physically present in the emergency department at the time a veteran is transferred, a qualified medical person (as defined by the Secretary in regulations) has signed a certification described in clause (ii) after a physician, in consultation with the person, has made the determination described in such clause, and subsequently countersigns the certification; and ``(B) the transfer is an appropriate transfer as described in paragraph (2). ``(2) An appropriate transfer to a medical facility is a transfer-- ``(A) in which the transferring medical facility provides the medical treatment within the capacity of the facility that minimizes the risks to the health of the enrolled veteran and, in the case of a woman in labor, the health of the unborn child; ``(B) in which the receiving facility-- ``(i) has available space and qualified personnel for the treatment of the veteran; and ``(ii) has agreed to accept transfer of the veteran and to provide appropriate medical treatment; ``(C) in which the transferring facility sends to the receiving facility all medical records (or copies thereof), related to the emergency condition for which the veteran has presented, available at the time of the transfer, including records related to the emergency medical condition of the veteran, observations of signs or symptoms, preliminary diagnosis, treatment provided, results of any tests and the informed written consent or certification (or copy thereof) provided under paragraph (1)(A), and the name and address of any on-call physician (described in subsection (d)(1)(C) of this section) who has refused or failed to appear within a reasonable time to provide necessary stabilizing treatment; ``(D) in which the transfer is effected through qualified personnel and transportation equipment, as required including the use of necessary and medically appropriate life support measures during the transfer; and ``(E) that meets such other requirements as the Secretary may find necessary in the interest of the health and safety of veterans transferred. ``(d) Charges.--(1) Nothing in this section may be construed to affect any charges that the Secretary may collect from a veteran or third party. ``(2) The Secretary shall treat any care provided by a non- Department facility pursuant to this section as care otherwise provided by a non-Department facility pursuant to this chapter for purposes of paying such non-Department facility for such care. ``(e) Nondiscrimination.--A medical facility of the Department or a non-Department facility, as the case may be, that has specialized capabilities or facilities (such as burn units, shock-trauma units, neonatal intensive care units, or (with respect to rural areas) regional referral centers as identified by the Secretary in regulation) shall not refuse to accept an appropriate transfer of an enrolled veteran who requires such specialized capabilities or facilities if the facility has the capacity to treat the veteran. ``(f) No Delay in Examination or Treatment.--A medical facility of the Department or a non-Department facility, as the case may be, may not delay provision of an appropriate medical screening examination required under subsection (a) or further medical examination and treatment required under subsection (b) of this section in order to inquire about the method of payment or insurance status of an enrolled veteran. ``(g) Whistleblower Protections.--The Secretary may not take adverse action against an employee of the Department because the employee refuses to authorize the transfer of an enrolled veteran with an emergency medical condition that has not been stabilized or because the employee reports a violation of a requirement of this section. ``(h) Definitions.--In this section: ``(1) The term `emergency medical condition' means-- ``(A) a medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in-- ``(i) placing the health of the enrolled veteran (or, with respect to an enrolled veteran who is a pregnant woman, the health of the woman or her unborn child) in serious jeopardy; ``(ii) serious impairment to bodily functions; or ``(iii) serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part; or ``(B) with respect to an enrolled veteran who is a pregnant woman having contractions-- ``(i) that there is inadequate time to effect a safe transfer to another hospital before delivery; or ``(ii) that transfer may pose a threat to the health or safety of the woman or the unborn child. ``(2) The term `enrolled veteran' means a veteran who is enrolled in the health care system established under section 1705(a) of this title. ``(3) The term `to stabilize' means, with respect to an emergency medical condition described in paragraph (1)(A), to provide such medical treatment of the condition as may be necessary to assure, within reasonable medical probability, that no material deterioration of the condition is likely to result from or occur during the transfer of the enrolled veteran from a facility, or, with respect to an emergency medical condition described in paragraph (1)(B), to deliver (including the placenta). ``(4) The term `stabilized' means, with respect to an emergency medical condition described in paragraph (1)(A), that no material deterioration of the condition is likely, within reasonable medical probability, to result from or occur during the transfer of the individual from a facility, or, with respect to an emergency medical condition described in [[Page H5892]] paragraph (1)(B), that the woman has delivered (including the placenta). ``(5) The term `transfer' means the movement (including the discharge) of an enrolled veteran outside the facilities of a medical facility of the Department at the direction of any individual employed by (or affiliated or associated, directly or indirectly, with) the Department, but does not include such a movement of an individual who-- ``(A) has been declared dead; or ``(B) leaves the facility without the permission of any such person.''. (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections of such chapter is amended by inserting after the item relating to section 1730A the following new item: ``1730B. Examination and treatment for emergency medical conditions and women in labor.''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Miller) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Takano) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. {time} 1630 General Leave Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to add extraneous material. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 3216, the Veterans Emergency Treatment--or VET--Act. It should be common sense, if a veteran is in need of medical attention and arrives on the grounds of a Department of Veterans Affairs medical facility, that veteran would be seen, assessed, and treated immediately. However, recently, a veteran who experienced a medical emergency in Washington State traveled as far as the parking lot of his local VA emergency room before finding he could go no further, and he called the VA and asked for help in making it through the doors. He was told by the VA staff who answered his call that he should hang up and dial 911. To hear the VA staff express an unwillingness or an apprehension about assisting a veteran in the midst of his having a medical emergency in its own parking lot is not only unacceptable, it is emblematic of how much the VA has lost its way. H.R. 3216 would require the VA to determine whether a medical emergency exists among any enrolled veteran who presents at a VA facility and would prohibit the VA from transferring a medically unstable veteran unless the veteran submits a written request to be transferred or it finds that it is clinically unnecessary. It would also prohibit the VA from taking an adverse action against any employee who refuses to authorize a transfer or who prevents the VA from delaying needed care by inquiring about payment method or insurance status. This legislation would help ensure that, in the case of a medical emergency, a veteran's health remains the number one priority, which is where it should always belong. This bill is sponsored by my friend and colleague, Congressman Dan Newhouse from Washington State. I am grateful to him for sponsoring this measure, and I urge all of my colleagues to join me in support of it. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in regard to H.R. 3216, the Veterans Emergency Treatment Act. This bill requires that, if an enrolled veteran in the VA requests treatment at a VA Emergency Department, he or she will get that examination or treatment whether or not it is related to a service- connected condition. It also prohibits the VA from transferring a patient to another facility without its having the written consent of that veteran unless a physician deems the transfer medically necessary. It further prohibits the VA from taking adverse action against any VA employee in his refusing to authorize the transfer of an enrolled veteran if it is contrary to the veteran's wishes. The purpose of this legislation is to have the VA follow the Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act. Mr. Speaker, I support this bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from the Fourth District of Washington State (Mr. Newhouse), the sponsor of this piece of legislation. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding me some time to speak on this important bill. Mr. Speaker, President Abraham Lincoln once famously charged all Americans with the responsibility ``to care for him who shall have borne the battle.'' If you speak with veterans today, you will learn that the quality of health care provided to them, many times, does not reflect this duty. In recent years, we have learned of multiple incidents in which the VA has failed to provide emergency care to veterans in need. In addition to the incidents that happened in my home State, another notable incident occurred in New Mexico, in the year 2014, when a veteran collapsed in the cafeteria of a VA facility, and he ultimately died when the VA refused to transport him 500 yards across the campus to the ER. My legislation will ensure that every enrolled veteran who arrives at the Emergency Department of a VA medical facility and who seeks emergency treatment is assessed and treated in order to prevent further injury or death. This is accomplished by applying the statutory requirements of the Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act, or EMTALA, to emergency care that is furnished by the VA to our veterans. This is a 1986 Federal statute that grants every individual a Federal right to emergency care. It requires a hospital to conduct a medical examination to determine if an emergency medical condition exists. If one does, then the hospital must either stabilize the patient or effectuate a proper transfer at the patient's request. Currently, VA hospitals are considered to be non-participating hospitals and, therefore, are not obligated to fulfill the requirements of EMTALA. The VET Act will remove the non-participating designation from VA hospitals and require them to fulfill the requirements of EMTALA, just as every other hospital does. Mr. Speaker, I urge the House to support and pass H.R. 3216. It is time we ensure that our veterans receive proper medical treatment during emergency medical situations, all without requiring additional spending. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 3216, the Veterans Emergency Treatment Act. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to support Mr. Newhouse's piece of legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Miller) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3216. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [House] [Pages H5891-H5892] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] VETERANS EMERGENCY TREATMENT ACT Mr. MILLER of Florida.

(b) clerical amendment.--the table of sections of such chapter is amended by inserting after the item relating to section 1730a the following new item: ``1730b. examination and treatment for emergency medical conditions and women in labor.''. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from florida (mr. miller) and the gentleman from california (mr. takano) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from florida. {time} 1630 general leave mr. miller of florida. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to add extraneous material. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from florida? there was no objection. mr. miller of florida. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i rise in support of h.r. 3216, the veterans emergency treatment--or vet--act. it should be common sense, if a veteran is in need of medical attention and arrives on the grounds of a department of veterans affairs medical facility, that veteran would be seen, assessed, and treated immediately. however, recently, a veteran who experienced a medical emergency in washington state traveled as far as the parking lot of his local va emergency room before finding he could go no further, and he called the va and asked for help in making it through the doors. he was told by the va staff who answered his call that he should hang up and dial 911. to hear the va staff express an unwillingness or an apprehension about assisting a veteran in the midst of his having a medical emergency in its own parking lot is not only unacceptable, it is emblematic of how much the va has lost its way. h.r. 3216 would require the va to determine whether a medical emergency exists among any enrolled veteran who presents at a va facility and would prohibit the va from transferring a medically unstable veteran unless the veteran submits a written request to be transferred or it finds that it is clinically unnecessary. it would also prohibit the va from taking an adverse action against any employee who refuses to authorize a transfer or who prevents the va from delaying needed care by inquiring about payment method or insurance status. this legislation would help ensure that, in the case of a medical emergency, a veteran's health remains the number one priority, which is where it should always belong. this bill is sponsored by my friend and colleague, congressman dan newhouse from washington state. i am grateful to him for sponsoring this measure, and i urge all of my colleagues to join me in support of it. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. takano. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i rise in regard to h.r. 3216, the veterans emergency treatment act. this bill requires that, if an enrolled veteran in the va requests treatment at a va emergency department, he or she will get that examination or treatment whether or not it is related to a service- connected condition. it also prohibits the va from transferring a patient to another facility without its having the written consent of that veteran unless a physician deems the transfer medically necessary. it further prohibits the va from taking adverse action against any va employee in his refusing to authorize the transfer of an enrolled veteran if it is contrary to the veteran's wishes. the purpose of this legislation is to have the va follow the emergency medical treatment & labor act. mr. speaker, i support this bill. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. miller of florida. mr. speaker, i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from the fourth district of washington state (mr. newhouse), the sponsor of this piece of legislation. mr. newhouse. mr. speaker, i thank the gentleman from florida for yielding me some time to speak on this important bill. mr. speaker, president abraham lincoln once famously charged all americans with the responsibility ``to care for him who shall have borne the battle.'' if you speak with veterans today, you will learn that the quality of health care provided to them, many times, does not reflect this duty. in recent years, we have learned of multiple incidents in which the va has failed to provide emergency care to veterans in need. in addition to the incidents that happened in my home state, another notable incident occurred in new mexico, in the year 2014, when a veteran collapsed in the cafeteria of a va facility, and he ultimately died when the va refused to transport him 500 yards across the campus to the er. my legislation will ensure that every enrolled veteran who arrives at the emergency department of a va medical facility and who seeks emergency treatment is assessed and treated in order to prevent further injury or death. this is accomplished by applying the statutory requirements of the emergency medical treatment & labor act, or emtala, to emergency care that is furnished by the va to our veterans. this is a 1986 federal statute that grants every individual a federal right to emergency care. it requires a hospital to conduct a medical examination to determine if an emergency medical condition exists. if one does, then the hospital must either stabilize the patient or effectuate a proper transfer at the patient's request. currently, va hospitals are considered to be non-participating hospitals and, therefore, are not obligated to fulfill the requirements of emtala. the vet act will remove the non-participating designation from va hospitals and require them to fulfill the requirements of emtala, just as every other hospital does. mr. speaker, i urge the house to support and pass h.r. 3216. it is time we ensure that our veterans receive proper medical treatment during emergency medical situations, all without requiring additional spending. mr. takano. mr. speaker, i ask my colleagues to join me in supporting h.r. 3216, the veterans emergency treatment act. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. miller of florida. mr. speaker, i ask all of my colleagues to support mr. newhouse's piece of legislation. i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from florida (mr. miller) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 3216. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",17143

OTIS BOWEN VETERAN HOUSE Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 5509) to name the Department of Veterans Affairs temporary lodging facility in Indianapolis, Indiana, as the ``Dr. Otis Bowen Veteran House''. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 5509 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. NAME OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS TEMPORARY LODGING FACILITY, INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA. The Department of Veterans Affairs temporary lodging facility in Indianapolis, Indiana, shall after the date of the enactment of this Act be known and designated as the ``Dr. Otis Bowen Veteran House''. Any reference to such temporary lodging facility in any law, regulation, map, document, record, or other paper of the United States shall be considered to be a reference to the Dr. Otis Bowen Veteran House. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Takano) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Indiana. General Leave Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Indiana? There was no objection. Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5509, which will formally rename the home for families of veterans undergoing medical treatment in Indianapolis as the Dr. Otis Bowen Veteran House. Passing this bill today is the least we can do to repay an individual who gave so much of himself to serving our Nation, to providing care to his neighbors as a family physician, and to supporting our veterans. As a lifelong Hoosier, Dr. Bowen was born and raised in Indiana and later went on to receive his bachelor's and his medical degree from Indiana University. As a newly minted doctor, ``Doc,'' as he became known, courageously served in the U.S. Army from 1943 to 1946. During his service in World War II, he bravely tended wounded servicemen during the first wave of Allied troops in the invasion of Okinawa in 1945. After serving his country, Doc Bowen came home to Indiana and set up a family medical practice in his hometown of Bremen, Indiana. During his 26 years of private practice, he delivered over 3,000 babies in a town with a population of just over 4,500 people. It was during this time that he also became involved with Indiana politics. Rising all the way from local coroner to speaker of the Indiana House of Representatives and, eventually, one of our State's most popular Governors, Doc Bowen consistently won the trust and respect of Hoosiers with his patented bedside manner. As Governor, Doc Bowen drew upon his war experiences as a combat physician to improve healthcare services in Indiana by pioneering a statewide emergency medical services system. Upon leaving office in 1981, Doc Bowen served as a professor of medicine and director of undergraduate medical practice education at the IU Medical Center in Indianapolis. Doc Bowen returned to public service in 1985, when he answered the call of President Ronald Reagan to become the first doctor to serve as Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. There he spearheaded the Federal Government's response to the spread of AIDS, promoted public awareness of the dangers of the disease, and worked toward its eradication. Throughout his career, Doc Bowen was active in our community as a force for good and advocate for others. Most notably, Doc Bowen was an active member of the American Legion post in Bremen for 59 years. He was also a member of the VFW, the American Medical Association, and he sat on the board of the Lilly Endowment, a philanthropic organization based in Indianapolis. Through Doc Bowen's leadership on the Board of the Lilly Endowment, the Richard L. Roudebush Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center secured a $9.9 million charitable grant to construct a home for the families of veterans undergoing surgery at the center. As a doctor, Doc Bowen knew that love is a vital component of the healing process and that a family can't dedicate their time and energy to the recovery process when they have to worry about where their next meal might be coming from or where they might lay their heads at night while visiting their family members at the hospital. Unfortunately, in 2013, Doc Bowen passed away at the age of 95. Throughout his career, he touched so many Hoosiers and always worked to enrich the lives of others through selfless sacrifice, hard work, and dedication. The eulogy of Pastor Rhode at his funeral summed up Doc's life most eloquently when he said: ``He only sought to work for others. He took the talents and gifts God gave him and used them to his fullest.'' {time} 1930 This is a lesson we all can learn from and is the reason I am proud to support [[Page H5906]] this bill. I also want to thank all of my Hoosier colleagues from both sides of the aisle who signed on and support this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to join my colleague, the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks) in supporting H.R. 5509, a bill to name the Department of Veterans Affairs temporary lodging facility in Indianapolis, Indiana, as the Dr. Otis Bowen Veteran House. Dr. Bowen was born near Rochester, Indiana. He graduated from Indiana University and received his M.D. degree from Indiana University School of Medicine. During World War II, he served in the U.S. Army Medical Corps from 1943 to 1946, and was with the first wave of Allied troops in the invasion of Okinawa in 1945, and was honorably discharged as a captain in 1946. When he returned home, he began his private practice, acquiring a respected place in Bremen, Indiana, as the country doctor. After serving in the Indiana Legislature for 14 years, Dr. Bowen was elected the 44th Governor of Indiana and ultimately served as the Secretary of Health and Human Services under President Ronald Reagan. I am very pleased to support this legislation and urge its passage. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my dear friend and colleague from California (Mr. Takano) for those remarks. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Walorski). She is my dear friend from northern Indiana who has also served on the Veterans' Affairs Committee. Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Representative Brooks from Indiana. I am thrilled to stand here tonight and be a part of naming this facility in Indianapolis the Dr. Otis Bowen Veteran House. Dr. Bowen spent most of his life in my district, Indiana's Second District. He was the consummate Hoosier, known for his personal integrity and leadership in service to this Nation and the State of Indiana. His nickname was Doc, as he was affectionately known, and I would be one person knocking on his door every so often just to check in and see how he was doing. He had a wall of fame in his house like none other. I would love to just sit and listen to his words of wisdom over the years. He was born in Rochester, Indiana, in Fulton County. He graduated from Francesville High School. To this day, today, all of those areas in those counties are proud that he actually resided in those areas. He received his medical degree from IU in 1942, completed his residency at Memorial Hospital of South Bend, joined the U.S. Medical Army Corps, was part of the first wave of troops to storm the beaches of Okinawa during World War II. After leaving the service, he started a family practice in Bremen, Indiana. In 1952, Doc began his career in public service, serving as Marshall County coroner in 1956, when he was elected to the Indiana House of Representatives. He was elected Governor of Indiana in 1972 and reelected in 1976. In 1985, Ronald Reagan appointed him as the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Service, the first medical doctor to serve in that role. His commitment to serving Hoosiers made him one of the most adored public servants in the State of Indiana. His dedication is exemplified by the fact that after all these accomplishments and awards, he said his proudest achievement was delivering those 3,000 babies as a family physician in Marshall County. I can't think of a more deserving person to name this facility after. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5509. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, before we conclude, I would like to take a moment to personally thank Chairman Miller for all that he has done throughout his tenure in the House of Representatives and in shepherding this bill. I also would like to thank his staff who have helped us bring this bill to the floor. The people of Florida's First Congressional District couldn't have asked for a more dedicated public servant. The work that Chairman Miller has done to advance the rights and care of veterans is truly remarkable. Whether it was in the trenches of war for Doc Bowen or in political office or at his doctor's office, Doc Bowen had a clear passion for serving others. However, he always reserved a special place in his heart for his fellow veterans, like Chairman Miller. That is why it is only appropriate that the house--the home--that he helped build for veterans and their families carry his name and serve as a permanent reminder of the character and fortitude of this legendary man. Mr. Speaker, I, once again, urge passage today. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5509. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [House] [Pages H5905-H5906] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DR.

He was also a member of the VFW, the American Medical Association, and he sat on the board of the Lilly Endowment, a philanthropic organization based in Indianapolis. Through Doc Bowen's leadership on the Board of the Lilly Endowment, the Richard L. Roudebush Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center secured a $9.9 million charitable grant to construct a home for the families of veterans undergoing surgery at the center. As a doctor, Doc Bowen knew that love is a vital component of the healing process and that a family can't dedicate their time and energy to the recovery process when they have to worry about where their next meal might be coming from or where they might lay their heads at night while visiting their family members at the hospital. Unfortunately, in 2013, Doc Bowen passed away at the age of 95. Throughout his career, he touched so many Hoosiers and always worked to enrich the lives of others through selfless sacrifice, hard work, and dedication. The eulogy of Pastor Rhode at his funeral summed up Doc's life most eloquently when he said: ``He only sought to work for others. He took the talents and gifts God gave him and used them to his fullest.'' {time} 1930 This is a lesson we all can learn from and is the reason I am proud to support [[Page H5906]] this bill. I also want to thank all of my Hoosier colleagues from both sides of the aisle who signed on and support this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to join my colleague, the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks) in supporting H.R. 5509, a bill to name the Department of Veterans Affairs temporary lodging facility in Indianapolis, Indiana, as the Dr. Otis Bowen Veteran House. Dr. Bowen was born near Rochester, Indiana. He graduated from Indiana University and received his M.D. degree from Indiana University School of Medicine. During World War II, he served in the U.S. Army Medical Corps from 1943 to 1946, and was with the first wave of Allied troops in the invasion of Okinawa in 1945, and was honorably discharged as a captain in 1946. When he returned home, he began his private practice, acquiring a respected place in Bremen, Indiana, as the country doctor. After serving in the Indiana Legislature for 14 years, Dr. Bowen was elected the 44th Governor of Indiana and ultimately served as the Secretary of Health and Human Services under President Ronald Reagan. I am very pleased to support this legislation and urge its passage. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my dear friend and colleague from California (Mr. Takano) for those remarks. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Walorski). She is my dear friend from northern Indiana who has also served on the Veterans' Affairs Committee. Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Representative Brooks from Indiana. I am thrilled to stand here tonight and be a part of naming this facility in Indianapolis the Dr. Otis Bowen Veteran House. Dr. Bowen spent most of his life in my district, Indiana's Second District. He was the consummate Hoosier, known for his personal integrity and leadership in service to this Nation and the State of Indiana. His nickname was Doc, as he was affectionately known, and I would be one person knocking on his door every so often just to check in and see how he was doing. He had a wall of fame in his house like none other. I would love to just sit and listen to his words of wisdom over the years. He was born in Rochester, Indiana, in Fulton County. He graduated from Francesville High School. To this day, today, all of those areas in those counties are proud that he actually resided in those areas. He received his medical degree from IU in 1942, completed his residency at Memorial Hospital of South Bend, joined the U.S. Medical Army Corps, was part of the first wave of troops to storm the beaches of Okinawa during World War II. After leaving the service, he started a family practice in Bremen, Indiana. In 1952, Doc began his career in public service, serving as Marshall County coroner in 1956, when he was elected to the Indiana House of Representatives. He was elected Governor of Indiana in 1972 and reelected in 1976. In 1985, Ronald Reagan appointed him as the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Service, the first medical doctor to serve in that role. His commitment to serving Hoosiers made him one of the most adored public servants in the State of Indiana. His dedication is exemplified by the fact that after all these accomplishments and awards, he said his proudest achievement was delivering those 3,000 babies as a family physician in Marshall County. I can't think of a more deserving person to name this facility after. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5509. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, before we conclude, I would like to take a moment to personally thank Chairman Miller for all that he has done throughout his tenure in the House of Representatives and in shepherding this bill. I also would like to thank his staff who have helped us bring this bill to the floor. The people of Florida's First Congressional District couldn't have asked for a more dedicated public servant. The work that Chairman Miller has done to advance the rights and care of veterans is truly remarkable. Whether it was in the trenches of war for Doc Bowen or in political office or at his doctor's office, Doc Bowen had a clear passion for serving others. However, he always reserved a special place in his heart for his fellow veterans, like Chairman Miller. That is why it is only appropriate that the house--the home--that he helped build for veterans and their families carry his name and serve as a permanent reminder of the character and fortitude of this legendary man. Mr. Speaker, I, once again, urge passage today. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5509. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [House] [Pages H5905-H5906] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DR. OTIS BOWEN VETERAN HOUSE Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 5509) to name the Department of Veterans Affairs temporary lodging facility in Indianapolis, Indiana, as the ``Dr. Otis Bowen Veteran House''. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 5509 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. NAME OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS TEMPORARY LODGING FACILITY, INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA. The Department of Veterans Affairs temporary lodging facility in Indianapolis, Indiana, shall after the date of the enactment of this Act be known and designated as the ``Dr. Otis Bowen Veteran House''. Any reference to such temporary lodging facility in any law, regulation, map, document, record, or other paper of the United States shall be considered to be a reference to the Dr. Otis Bowen Veteran House. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Takano) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Indiana. General Leave Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Indiana? There was no objection. Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5509, which will formally rename the home for families of veterans undergoing medical treatment in Indianapolis as the Dr. Otis Bowen Veteran House. Passing this bill today is the least we can do to repay an individual who gave so much of himself to serving our Nation, to providing care to his neighbors as a family physician, and to supporting our veterans. As a lifelong Hoosier, Dr. Bowen was born and raised in Indiana and later went on to receive his bachelor's and his medical degree from Indiana University. As a newly minted doctor, ``Doc,'' as he became known, courageously served in the U.S. Army from 1943 to 1946. During his service in World War II, he bravely tended wounded servicemen during the first wave of Allied troops in the invasion of Okinawa in 1945. After serving his country, Doc Bowen came home to Indiana and set up a family medical practice in his hometown of Bremen, Indiana. During his 26 years of private practice, he delivered over 3,000 babies in a town with a population of just over 4,500 people. It was during this time that he also became involved with Indiana politics. Rising all the way from local coroner to speaker of the Indiana House of Representatives and, eventually, one of our State's most popular Governors, Doc Bowen consistently won the trust and respect of Hoosiers with his patented bedside manner. As Governor, Doc Bowen drew upon his war experiences as a combat physician to improve healthcare services in Indiana by pioneering a statewide emergency medical services system. Upon leaving office in 1981, Doc Bowen served as a professor of medicine and director of undergraduate medical practice education at the IU Medical Center in Indianapolis. Doc Bowen returned to public service in 1985, when he answered the call of President Ronald Reagan to become the first doctor to serve as Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. There he spearheaded the Federal Government's response to the spread of AIDS, promoted public awareness of the dangers of the disease, and worked toward its eradication. Throughout his career, Doc Bowen was active in our community as a force for good and advocate for others. Most notably, Doc Bowen was an active member of the American Legion post in Bremen for 59 years. He was also a member of the VFW, the American Medical Association, and he sat on the board of the Lilly Endowment, a philanthropic organization based in Indianapolis.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter). General Leave Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 5978. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, before we talk about H.R. 5978, I would like to talk about what is not in this bill, which is probably one of the most important things that is my duty, Mr. Garamendi's duty, and the Coast Guard's duty to get done--and that is build a polar icebreaker. Let me tell you why there is no polar icebreaker in this bill: the CBO couldn't get their act together in time to score this one way or another. So, again, this body is held ransom by the Congressional Budget Office not scoring something one way or another, whether it is good to go or not. The reason it is so important that we have more polar icebreakers and that we included the language that passed the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee last week is this: we do not have 24/7, 365- day polar icebreaking ability for the Arctic. The Russians have over 40 polar icebreakers. That is over 40, some of which are even nuclear. China has got more than 20 now. The United States only has one that is capable of crushing heavy ice, and even that is not available 24/7, 365. The High Latitude Region Mission Analysis revealed the following Coast Guard missions--defense readiness; ice operations; marine environmental protection; and ports, waterways, and coastal security in the Arctic--were significantly impacted by the gap in this mission performance. It is these gaps and the knowledge that, when the Polar Star reaches the end of its extended service life, we will have a period where the Coast Guard doesn't have a heavy icebreaker at all, let alone what it has now, which is limited capability in the Arctic. Progress is being made on the acquisition front. Mr. Garamendi and I and the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee granted the Coast Guard the capability to do block buys, which is what the Navy has, where you can purchase more than one vessel at a time, which saves billions of dollars. We also gave them the ability to have lead-time materials, which means they could buy the materials way in advance, which would save tens of millions of dollars. The Coast Guard now has this ability for the FRC and the OPC. We want them to have it for the icebreaker as well, but because of the CBO not scoring this, we weren't able to get the language in. Here is the specific language that is missing from H.R. 5978: ``The Commandant of the Coast Guard, subject to the availability of amounts specifically provided in advance in subsequent appropriations acts may enter into a contract for the acquisition of no less than three heavy polar icebreakers; and may enter into a contract for acquisition of additional polar icebreakers, except that the total number of icebreakers acquired under this subsection may not exceed six.'' We are talking about three. Right now we have one. ``Such acquisitions may be made through block buy contracts; may be incrementally funded; may include combined purchases, also known as economic order quantity purchases, of materials and components; and long lead time materials; and may include advance construction funding.'' This is what the Navy has for every ship that they make. This is one reason we created a joint program office between the Coast Guard and the Navy, so that the Navy can push the Coast Guard to do the right thing. The Coast Guard, let it be said, at the best, has been dragging their feet on acquiring these icebreakers. In fact, they have been pushing back against Congress every inch of the way on this. In my point of view, this is just like UAVs, or the unmanned aerial vehicles that we have now, Predators and the like. Congress earmarked those because the Air Force did not want pilotless airplanes. Then you would have to get rid of pilots. So the Air Force pushed back day and night in the late nineties and this Congress earmarked Predator drones. That is why we have Predator drones. The military pushed back against Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles, also known as MRAP vehicles, which have saved thousands of lives in Iraq and Afghanistan, also pushed by Congress, not the U.S. military. In things like this, Congress is able to see things outside the box, which the Coast Guard cannot in this case. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter) has been an extraordinary leader on trying to address a critical need that the United States has. The Arctic Ocean is opening. There is not only a Northwest Passage, but there is a Northeast Passage. And this year, just a couple of weeks ago--less than 2 weeks ago--a cruise ship passed through the Northwest Passage without the aid of an icebreaker. We absolutely have to have a polar icebreaker. As the chairman said, we have one icebreaker today, and it is going to go in for overhaul. When it does, we have no heavy icebreaker either for the North Pole or the South Pole. We are in trouble. We have to have this. The U.S. Navy has to have it. U.S. security has to have it. And certainly for the commerce in the Arctic, we have to have it. It is a reality. The Arctic Ocean is opening. Commerce will take place. And it will also need military availability in that area. The legislation that is before us today does not have the proper language in it because of CBO sitting on [[Page H5898]] their duff and doodling numbers when we know we need this language. The Senate appropriations bill has a billion dollars for icebreakers, but there is no authorization. Unfortunately, because of our rules here, we had to strip the language out. Later, we hope to put the language back in, but it is not available today. We have to have this. We go back meeting after meeting, hearing after hearing, year after year, 4 or 5 years that we have been working on this, and then, at the very last moment, CBO can't get its act together. Well, I am sorry, CBO. We ought to waive the rules and get on with what we need to do here, which is to provide the authorization. The language that the chairman has worked out with me and others would not only provide the authorization, but would do it in such a way as to give us the very best possible financial deal on the construction of icebreakers--that is a block buy--and also authorizing, should the money be available in the future, an additional three lighter icebreakers beyond the three heavy icebreakers. Not to say we are going to build it all at once, but the authorization is in the law. That then allows the Coast Guard to properly line it up for the very best deal that we can get, maybe one at a time, maybe two or three over a 5- or 10-year period of time. Unfortunately, that language had to be stripped out. So when the chairman started his explanation of this bill, he did so to call all of our attention to what is not in the bill that should have been in the bill, but for CBO and the rules that we have that require us to have CBO's accounting before we move an authorization. That is where we are today. Unfortunately, it is where we are. So we are going to move this bill along. We will probably--hopefully--come back before this session is over in the lameduck session and write this thing properly. Unfortunately, today we are not there. There is more to be said about the rest of the bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, now we are going to get back to H.R. 5978, which is a very good bill in and of itself that, once again, doesn't have the language that we tried to get in. H.R. 5978, the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Amendments Act of 2016, is a catch-all bill that addresses a number of different Coast Guard and maritime transportation issues. The bill involves improvements to the Coast Guard acquisition authorities to ensure the acquisition program keeps in mind the needs of Coast Guard operating units when acquiring assets. This provision also requires an analysis on the use of multiyear procurement and block buy authorities related to the purchase of Fast Response Cutters, Offshore Patrol Cutters, and polar icebreakers, but just a report. We already know from watching the Navy do business for the last few decades that block buys save hundreds of millions of dollars. At the request of the GAO, the bill repeals a GAO report regarding disbursements from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. The information that was collected by GAO will be incorporated into an existing Coast Guard report. Due to certain recent weather events impacting a Coast Guard pier in Wilmington, North Carolina, the Coast Guard is required to issue a one- time report detailing short- and long-term plans to replace and maintain the pier. Certain fishing industries will be assisted by the bill, including those that would be affected by a prescribed Alternative Safety Compliance Program to be issued by the Coast Guard by January 1, 2017. If the service does not issue the program by January 1, 2017, which is hopefully the case, the bill would provide a 3-year window for industry compliance from the date the Coast Guard issues the program. It has been a long-term interest for many, including Ranking Member Garamendi, who has been instrumental--and I would say more instrumental than myself--in preparing the language included in this legislation that there be a reliable land-based positioning, navigation, and timing system to complement, supplement, and back up the Global Positioning System that we now use, the GPS. We have all seen what the Chinese can do now in knocking down satellites. If our GPS goes out, there is no other way for us to navigate the oceans or to navigate land. The eLoran system does this to ensure the continuous availability of uncorrupted or non-degraded signals for military and civilian users. The bill directed the Coast Guard to establish and maintain such a backup system. {time} 1915 Aids to navigation are important tools that allow vessels to safely navigate waterways. The bill would allow the Commandant, subject to appropriations, to reimburse a non-Federal entity for costs incurred by that entity to construct and establish an aid to navigation that would otherwise be constructed by the Coast Guard. Aids to navigation facilitate safe and efficient maritime transportation on federally authorized navigation channels. Specific conditions for reimbursement are outlined. Reimbursements for a single project are limited to $5 million, and the authority expires 4 years after the date of enactment of the bill. There are concerns with the Coast Guard's Western Alaska Captain of the Port Zone approving alternate planning criteria for areas covering only a portion of the zone. This action would create two adjacent areas with different levels of prevention and response preparedness. This bill requires public notice, an economic study, and a report to Congress on the study before approval of any criteria not covering the full Western Alaska zone. Lastly, the bill makes a variety of technical changes to provisions in enacted Coast Guard Authorization Acts. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. (Mr. GARAMENDI asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I join Chairman Hunter in strong support for the legislation and to advance this new policy initiative to improve the oversight of the Coast Guard and the major acquisition programs, and also to advance the safety and security of the U.S. maritime industry. H.R. 5978, the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Amendments Act, is bipartisan legislation. We have talked about some of the provisions that are not in the bill. I will try to talk about those that are in the bill. It deserves the robust support from Members on both sides of the aisle, and I urge its quick passage, probably as early as today. I thank the gentleman, Mr. Hunter, for his unwavering support of the Coast Guard and the work that we are able to do together with the members of the committee. Of great significance, this legislation will address an overlooked and underappreciated threat to our national and economic security: the fact that GPS, Global Positioning System, it has been identified for nearly 20 years as the single point of failure, with serious implications for our national security and economy. I know we are not able to use these little machines called cell phones on the floor, but if we could, they are totally reliant on GPS. You go down to the ATM, it will not work without GPS. Our systems of navigation, including such things as positive train control, totally dependent upon GPS. In fact, Wall Street, totally dependent on GPS. It is timing, navigation, and positioning. That is GPS. We have no backup; other countries do. You might ask, why is China, why is Russia, why are they building a GLAN-based backup to GPS? Well, they know that if there is trouble, the first thing that is going to disappear is GPS. Right now, GPS can be knocked out by somebody driving down the freeway with their 18-wheeler and using an antiradar device. You might ask what happened at the Newark airport. That is exactly what happened. GPS was knocked out by somebody on Interstate 95 with a radar device. It is a very weak signal, but it is an extraordinarily important signal. So this bill provides for a backup system which has been discussed for nearly 20 [[Page H5899]] years, and we have gone round and round the Bush--I guess that is the right thing--and the Clinton, in between, without any action. So this bill would actually push this forward to give us an opportunity to establish a backup system, which is actually very old but will be updated with the enhanced LORAN system, dating back to the 1940s, which was the first navigational system that we built in the United States. Much of the system is already available; the towers, the locations, much of that is in place. This would authorize a public-private partnership to put that in place. I won't go into it anymore, but it is high time that we get on with this. The chairman laid out how it is going to be done in his talk and, hopefully, we can finally get this underway. There are many, many other pieces that are in this legislation. We have talked a little bit about the Coast Guard icebreakers. We do have a study--oh, my goodness, another study. It is the best we could do at the moment. The chairman and I talked about what we would like to accomplish with more than that with his actual authorization. The block buy, we have got to do it, and, hopefully, we will. There are other things that are in the bill that the chairman has described. I won't go into them today in any more detail but to say that, in my written statement, it will be covered. One more thing, to back up the GPS, I include in the Record about 15 years of studies by Federal Government agencies that all say we have got to have a backup system, and the eLORAN is the best. Mr. Chairman, shall we continue on and beat this for a while longer or shall we say let's pass the bill and get on with it? I am pleased to rise and join Chairman Hunter in strong support of this legislation to advance new policy initiatives to improve the oversight of the Coast Guard's major acquisition programs and to advance the safety and security of the U.S. maritime industry. H.R. 5978, the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Amendments Act of 2016, is bipartisan legislation that was developed to address issues that have arisen since the Congress passed a two-year comprehensive Coast Guard authorization bill earlier this year. This legislation is deserving of robust support from members on both sides of the aisle and I urge its quick passage by the House today so it can be sent to the other body for its consideration and passage before the 114th Congress adjourns sine die. I want to thank Chairman Hunter for his unwavering leadership and for the cooperative spirit of this excellent staff in working with me and other Democratic members to address our interests and concerns in this legislation. Of greatest significance, this legislation will address an overlooked need and under-appreciated threat to our national and economic security--the fact that the Global Positioning System, or GPS, has been identified as a single point of failure with serious implications for our national security and economy. GPS has revolutionized how we live, work, and play. Signals provided by GPS satellites ensure that literally everything that we routinely depend on not only runs, but runs with unprecedented reliability and precision. We have all benefitted from GPS: whether through the distribution of power from our electric grid; the coordination of timing signals for trains and traffic signals; or, to improve the efficiency of maritime search and rescue missions launched by the Coast Guard. There is no denying that GPS has been a tremendous technological asset. But the reality is that GPS signals are relatively weak and fairly easy to degrade, disrupt or jam. This is not a hypothetical matter; this threat is real, and it is happening now. Just last week, the Commandant of the Coast Guard, Admiral Paul Zukunft, while speaking at a National Harbor Safety Conference in Portland, Oregon, cited over 100 instances in which vessels experienced disruption to their GPS reception. There is nothing we can do to change the underlying physics of the GPS signal. We can, however, take necessary and appropriate actions now to ensure that a reliable land-based back-up system for positioning, navigation and timing signals is available when needed. Moreover, if the Russians, the Chinese, the EU, and other nations are developing land-based GPS back-up systems, the United States should have its own system as well. Since 2001 the Federal Government, notably the PNT Executive Committee, has been evaluating options. The Executive Committee concluded in December, 2014 that an enhanced LORAN, or eLORAN system, would be the most cost-effective and reliable back-up for GPS signals. What this legislation will do is force the Federal Government to finally take action on its own recommendation. The Coast Guard, which for decades operated the LORAN-C navigation system (the predecessor of GPS), would be directed to publish a request for proposals, complete a plan for the architecture of an eLORAN system, and get a system built and fully operational within three years. Make no mistake, this is a significant undertaking. But the stakes of doing nothing is a risky roll of the dice we would be well-advised to avoid. I strongly urge members on both sides to support this important provision. I am also very pleased that this legislation continues to move forward in our efforts to recapitalize the Coast Guard's legacy fleet of polar class heavy icebreakers. It is clear that we are witnessing the opening of the Arctic to maritime commerce, and with it, the creation of a whole new ocean of operational responsibility for the Coast Guard. In this most challenging of maritime environments, it is vital that the Service has the icebreaking capabilities it will need to operate safely and effectively. I must express my disappointment that we were unable to retain the ``block buy'' provision that was reported out of the Transportation Committee. Nevertheless, the analysis of multi-year procurement and block buy contracting called for in this legislation would be helpful to have on hand when the Congress ultimately does appropriate funds for the construction of these vital new national security assets. I also want to express my support for other provisions in the bill, notably language that will ensure commercial fishermen a full three years to comply with new alternative safety compliance program requirements from the date the Coast Guard publishes these requirements. Additionally, I want to express my support for the provision that would grant to the Coast Guard authority to reimburse private entities for their costs to construct a Federal navigation aid. The additional sideboards that were added have clarified the scope and intent of this new authority. I want to thank Congressman Blake Farenthold for his willingness to work to improve this provision. Mr. Speaker, I again want to express my appreciation to Chairman Hunter and his staff for their support for the Coast Guard and the U.S. Maritime industry, and for their collaboration in developing this legislation. I also want to thank the Chairman of the full Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Congressman Bill Shuster, and the Ranking Member on the full Committee, Congressman Peter DeFazio, for their leadership and support for the Committee's maritime agenda. In closing, this legislation is bipartisan and non-controversial. It deserves the full support of the House. NSPD-39: U.S. Space-Based Position, Navigation, and Timing Policy, December 15, 2004 FACT SHEET The President authorized a new national policy on December 8, 2004 that establishes guidance and implementation actions for space-based positioning, navigation, and timing programs, augmentations, and activities for U.S. national and homeland security, civil, scientific, and commercial purposes. This policy supersedes Presidential Decision Directive/National Science and Technology Council-6, U.S. Global Positioning System Policy, dated March 28, 1996. I. Scope and Definitions This policy provides guidance for: (1) development, acquisition, operation, sustainment, and modernization of the Global Positioning System and U.S.-developed, owned and/or operated systems used to augment or otherwise improve the Global Positioning System and/or other space-based positioning, navigation, and timing signals; (2) development, deployment, sustainment, and modernization of capabilities to protect U.S. and allied access to and use of the Global Positioning System for national, homeland, and economic security, and to deny adversaries access to any space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services; and (3) foreign access to the Global Positioning System and United States Government augmentations, and international cooperation with foreign space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services, including augmentations. For purposes of this document: ``Interoperable'' refers to the ability of civil U.S. and foreign space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services to be used together to provide better capabilities at the user level than would be achieved by relying solely on one service or signal; ``Compatible'' refers to the ability of U.S. and foreign space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services to be used separately or together without interfering with each individual service or signal, and without adversely affecting navigation warfare; and ``Augmentation'' refers to space and/or ground-based systems that provide users of space-based positioning, navigation, and timing signals with additional information [[Page H5900]] that enables users to obtain enhanced performance when compared to the un-augmented space-based signals alone. These improvements include better accuracy, availability, integrity, and reliability, with independent integrity monitoring and alerting capabilities for critical applications. II. Background Over the past decade, the Global Positioning System has grown into a global utility whose multiuse services are integral to U.S. national security, economic growth, transportation safety, and homeland security, and are an essential element of the worldwide economic infrastructure. In the year 2000, the United States recognized the increasing importance of the Global Positioning System to civil and commercial users by discontinuing the deliberate degradation of accuracy for non-military signals, known as Selective Availability. Since that time, commercial and civil applications of the Global Positioning System have continued to multiply and their importance has increased significantly. Services dependent on Global Positioning System information are now an engine for economic growth, enhancing economic development, and improving safety of life, and the system is a key component of multiple sectors of U.S. critical infrastructure. While the growth in civil and commercial applications continues, the positioning, navigation, and timing information provided by the Global Positioning System remains critical to U.S. national security, and its applications are integrated into virtually every facet of U.S. military operations. United States and allied military forces will continue to rely on the Global Positioning System military services for positioning, navigation, and timing services. The continuing growth of services based on the Global Positioning System presents opportunities, risks, and threats to U.S. national, homeland, and economic security. The widespread and growing dependence on the Global Positioning System of military, civil, and commercial systems and infrastructures has made many of these systems inherently vulnerable to an unexpected interruption in positioning, navigation, and/or timing services. In addition, whether designed for military capabilities or not, all positioning, navigation, and timing signals from space and their augmentations provide inherent capabilities that can be used by adversaries, including enemy military forces and terrorist groups. Finally, emerging foreign space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services could enhance or undermine the future utility of the Global Positioning System. The United States must continue to improve and maintain the Global Positioning System, augmentations, and backup capabilities to meet growing national, homeland, and economic security requirements, for civil requirements, and to meet commercial and scientific demands. In parallel, we must continue to improve capabilities to deny adversary access to all space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services, particularly including services that are openly available and can be readily used by adversaries and/or terrorists to threaten the security of the United States. In addition, the diverse requirements for and multiple applications of space- based positioning, navigation, and timing services require stable yet adaptable policies and management mechanisms. The existing management mechanisms for the Global Positioning System and its augmentations must be modified to accommodate a multi-use approach to program planning, resource allocation, system development, and operations. Therefore, the United States Government must improve the policy and management framework governing the Global Positioning System and its augmentations to support their continued ability to meet increasing and varied domestic and global requirements. III. Goals and Objectives The fundamental goal of this policy is to ensure that the United States maintains space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services, augmentation, back-up, and service denial capabilities that: (1) provide uninterrupted availability of positioning, navigation, and timing services; (2) meet growing national, homeland, economic security, and civil requirements, and scientific and commercial demands; (3) remain the pre-eminent military space-based positioning, navigation, and timing service; (4) continue to provide civil services that exceed or are competitive with foreign civil space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services and augmentation systems; (5) remain essential components of internationally accepted positioning, navigation, and timing services; and (6) promote U.S. technological leadership in applications involving space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services. To achieve this goal, the United States Government shall: Provide uninterrupted access to U.S. space-based global, precise positioning, navigation, and timing services for U.S. and allied national security systems and capabilities through the Global Positioning System, without being dependent on foreign positioning, navigation, and timing services; Provide on a continuous, worldwide basis civil space-based, positioning, navigation, and timing services free of direct user fees for civil, commercial, and scientific uses, and for homeland security through the Global Positioning System and its augmentations, and provide open, free access to information necessary to develop and build equipment to use these services; Improve capabilities to deny hostile use of any space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services, without unduly disrupting civil and commercial access to civil positioning, navigation, and timing services outside an area of military operations, or for homeland security purposes; Improve the performance of space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services, including more robust resistance to interference for, and consistent with, U.S. and allied national security purposes, homeland security, and civil, commercial, and scientific users worldwide; Maintain the Global Positioning System as a component of multiple sectors of the U.S. Critical Infrastructure, consistent with Homeland Security Presidential Directive-7, Critical Infrastructure Identification, Prioritization, and Protection, dated December 17, 2003; Encourage foreign development of positioning, navigation, and timing services and systems based on the Global Positioning System. Seek to ensure that foreign space-based positioning, navigation, and timing systems are interoperable with the civil services of the Global Positioning System and its augmentations in order to benefit civil, commercial, and scientific users worldwide. At a minimum, seek to ensure that foreign systems are compatible with the Global Positioning System and its augmentations and address mutual security concerns with foreign providers to prevent hostile use of space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services; and Promote the use of U.S. space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services and capabilities for applications at the Federal, State, and local level, to the maximum practical extent. IV. Management of Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Services This policy establishes a permanent National Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Executive Committee.

The Secretaries of Defense and Transportation shall develop the procedures by which the Committee shall operate. The Executive Committee shall make recommendations to its member Departments and Agencies, and to the President through the representatives of the Executive Office of the President. In addition, the Executive Committee will advise and coordinate with and among the Departments and Agencies responsible for the strategic decisions regarding policies, architectures, requirements, and resource allocation for maintaining and improving U.S. space-based positioning, navigation, and timing infrastructures, including the Global Positioning System, its augmentations, security for these services, and relationships with foreign positioning, navigation, and timing services. Specifically, the Executive Committee shall: Ensure that national security, homeland security, and civil requirements receive full and appropriate consideration in the decision-making process and facilitate the integration and de-confliction of these requirements for space-based positioning, navigation, and timing capabilities, as required; Coordinate individual Departments' and Agencies' positioning, navigation, and timing program plans, requirements, budgets, and policies, and assess the adequacy of funding and schedules to meet validated requirements in a timely manner; Ensure that the utility of civil services exceeds, or is at least equivalent to, those routinely provided by foreign space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services; Promote plans to modernize the U.S. space-based positioning, navigation, and timing infrastructure, including: (1) development, deployment, and operation of new and/or improved national security and public safety services when required and to the maximum practical extent; and (2) determining the apportionment of requirements between the Global Positioning System and its augmentations, including consideration of user equipment; Review proposals and provide recommendations to the Departments and Agencies for international cooperation, as well as spectrum management and protection issues; and Establish a space-based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Advisory Board. The board shall be comprised of experts from outside the United States Government, and shall be chartered as a Federal Advisory Committee. The Executive Committee shall establish the National Space- Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Coordination Office. This [[Page H5901]] office shall provide the staff functions for the Executive Committee. It shall be led by a full-time Director chosen by, and reporting to the Executive Committee, and shall include a cadre of full-time staff provided by Departments and Agencies represented on the Executive Committee. The Executive Committee shall determine the resources for the National Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Coordination Office, including funding, location, staffing, and composition, consistent with the direction of this policy. The National Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Coordination Office shall serve as the Secretariat for the Executive Committee and shall perform those functions delegated by the Executive Committee. Departments and Agencies shall provide appropriate information to the National Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Coordination Office to ensure interagency transparency about positioning, navigation, and timing programs, policies, budgets, and activities that might affect mutual interests or interagency dependencies. The Interagency Global Positioning System Executive Board is hereby disestablished, and the Executive Committee or the National Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Coordination Office, as appropriate, shall assume its functions as defined in the Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Executive Committee Charter, consistent with the direction provided in this policy. The Executive Committee shall advise and coordinate the interdepartmental resource allocation for the Global Positioning System and it augmentations on an annual basis. The Secretary of Defense shall have primary responsibility for providing resources for development, acquisition, operation, sustainment, and modernization of the Global Positioning System. The Secretary of Transportation shall provide resources to the Secretary of Defense for assessment, development, acquisition, implementation, operation, and sustainment of additional designated Global Positioning System civil capabilities beyond the second and third civil signals already contained in the current Global Positioning System program Global Positioning System civil signal performance monitoring, augmentations, and other unique positioning, navigation, and timing capabilities will be funded by the agency or agencies requiring those services or capabilities, including out-year procurement and operations costs. Any new technical features proposed and funded by the civil agencies shall not degrade or displace existing or planned national security functions of the system. If the Executive Committee recommends that the availability of Global Positioning System capabilities should be accelerated, the Executive Committee will make recommendations regarding the resources required to accelerate those capabilities. Resource issues will be resolved during the regular budget process. The details of the cost sharing between: (1) the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation, for the Global Positioning System; and (2) Departments and Agencies sponsoring augmentations, and/or unique or accelerated capabilities, shall be outlined in a Five-Year National Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Plan, consistent with the guidance provided in this policy. V. Foreign Access to U.S. Space-based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Capabilities Any exports of U.S. positioning, navigation, and timing capabilities covered by the United States Munitions List or the Commerce Control List will continue to be licensed pursuant to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations or the Export Administration Regulations, as appropriate, and in accordance with all existing laws and regulations. As a general guideline, export of civil or other non-United States Munitions List space-based positioning, navigation and timing capabilities that are currently available or are planned to be available in the global marketplace will continue to be considered favorably. Exports of sensitive or advanced positioning, navigation, and timing information, systems, technologies, and components will be considered on a case-by-case basis in accordance with existing laws and regulations, as well as relevant national security and foreign policy goals and considerations. In support of such reviews, the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretaries of Defense, Commerce, and Energy, the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the Director of Central Intelligence, shall modify and maintain the Sensitive Technology List directed in U.S. Commercial Remote Sensing Space Policy, dated April 25, 2003, including those technology items or areas deemed sensitive for positioning, navigation and timing applications. The Secretaries of State and Commerce shall use the list in the evaluation of requests for exports. VI.

Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Farenthold). Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill. There are a lot of good things in it for the Nation. As a former computer technician, I know there is nothing worse than a single point of failure in the network. GPS is a single point of failure for a lot of things; eLORAN is absolutely must-have. We can talk about what is not in the bill as well, but I do want to talk about a section that is specifically important to the district I represent. Section 202 grants the authority for the Coast Guard to reimburse non-Federal entities for the cost of construction to certain aids to navigation. This authority ensures these types of safety-related navigation projects can move forward in a timely fashion. We are all too aware of how slow the government can be, especially when it comes to funding projects, so we have come up with a way here where we can work with non-Federal partners to improve the safety of our navigation system. It doesn't cost the government anything. The non-Federal partners go ahead and put in the equipment up to Coast Guard standards with Coast Guard approval and get it done now; and then, when the Coast Guard gets the money, when the red tape and government machine moves through its procedure, they can get reimbursed, while our mariners can enjoin the enhanced safety and our ports can enjoy [[Page H5903]] the enhanced economic activity as a result of being able to, for instance, traverse channels in low-light conditions. It is safety. It is good for the economy. In fact, one of the problems that brought this to my attention was when there was a project in Corpus Christi, the La Quinta Channel. Somehow, the aids to navigation never got built, even though this channel has been dredged and is in use. The pilots say it is unsafe to use in low-light conditions, and it looks like it could be years before the Coast Guard gets around to funding it. Well, the Port of Corpus Christi is willing to pony up the money today. The Coast Guard says: All right; when we get it, we will give it back. This piece of legislation allows that to happen. It is good government, along with lots of other pieces of this legislation, something we need to pass, and I urge my colleagues to git-r-done. Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. We need polar icebreakers. This body is going to push; Mr. Garamendi and I are going to push and push until we have polar icebreakers and we have at least \1/140\ the capability of Russia. That is a pretty low bar that we are setting for ourselves, but we are going to set it right here, right now, in this body. Let's at least have \1/140\ of the capability or Russia, build those polar icebreakers. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support H.R. 5978. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following materials: Exelis, UrsaNav, the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Coast Guard Enter Agreement to Trial Ground-Based Position, Navigation and Timing Signal Herndon, VA, May 22, 2015.--Exelis (NYSE: XLS), UrsaNav, Inc., the Department of Homeland Security's Science and Technology Directorate (DHS S&T), and the U.S. Coast Guard have entered into a cooperative research and development agreement (CRADA) for testing and demonstration at former LORAN-C sites. These sites are the legacy ground-based radio navigation infrastructure of the decommissioned LORAN-C service that could be retained and upgraded to provide eLORAN low frequency service. The team will evaluate eLORAN as a potential complementary system to the current Global Positioning System (GPS) currently in wide use throughout the United States. The capabilities and potential utilization methods of eLORAN will be explored in depth to identify all strengths, capacities, and potential vulnerabilities of the technology. Under the CRADA, Exelis will use the former LORAN-C assets to put eLORAN signals in space for research, test and demonstration of the ability of eLORAN to meet precise positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) requirements of government and privately-owned critical infrastructure. The first station Exelis will broadcast from is located in Wildwood, NJ. The broadcast will provide a usable signal at a range up to 1000 miles. ``eLORAN is an ideal technology to complement GPS for critical, resilient and assured PNT,'' said Ed Sayadian, vice president of Civil & Aerospace Systems for Exelis. ``eLORAN is a difficult to disrupt technology that offers PNT and wide area broadcast data capabilities indoors, in underground locations and other GPS-denied environments.'' ``A preponderance of government, academic, and industry reports have concluded that eLORAN is the best independent, multi-modal solution to provide assured PNT as a complement to GPS,'' said Chuck Schue, president and CEO of UrsaNay. Exelis and UrsaNav have entered into this CRADA because they believe that low frequency signals, such as eLORAN, operate independently of GPS signals and can provide alternative timing, either standalone, or as a component of a PNT service. Exelis also believes that as a result of its wealth of experience in its PNT portfolio, that there are many civil and defense applications that require precise time and/or position in GPS-denied environments. Examples include radio frequency interference, both intentional and unintentional; signal attenuation from heavy forest canopy, terrain or buildings; and indoor and underground locations. About UsaNav: UrsaNav, Inc. is a Veteran-Owned and Service- Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business focused on delivering innovative engineering and information solutions, and associated professional services to government and commercial clients worldwide.

Dear Congressman DeFazio: Thank you for your August 31, 2015, letter regarding the importance of the Global Positioning System (GPS) and the need for a complementary positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) capability for the nation. We share your concerns regarding the importance of GPS to our critical infrastructure and security requirements. Seeking to implement the guidance from National Security Presidential Directive 39, the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Transportation established an interagency process in 2014 to assess those information sources that are complementary to GPS and that could be used to ensure the continuity of PNT services to critical infrastructure. Through this interagency process, the National Space-Based PNT Executive Committee (EXCOM) reviewed several potential solutions and assessed that an enhanced Loran (eLoran) network could be a viable nationwide complementary capability for GPS applications in U.S. critical infrastructure. The EXCOM also assessed that a timing-focused network could be implemented in the near term with properly scoped specifications, costs, and cost sharing arrangements. As you stated, there may be opportunities to work with private and commercial entities to initiate these complementary capabilities. The EXCOM met on September 3, 2015, and agreed to a two- fold strategy for activities to explore a national complementary capability to GPS: pursue potential near-term opportunities to leverage public and private sector capabilities and resources to support a timing-focused eLoran network, while also documenting the requirements for a more comprehensive complementary PNT capability for the nation's critical infrastructure. The EXCOM acknowledges the challenges associated with this undertaking, especially given the fact that no government- wide set of requirements has been established for such a complementary capability. However, sufficient data exists from previous studies to produce initial cost estimates and basic system specifications to determine the appropriate scope of the effort. We are building on these data and estimates to develop a more detailed approach for an initial timing-focused eLoran capability. This initial timing network could provide a near-term solution while we continue our efforts to prescribe a complete set of requirements necessary to support a full complementary PNT capability for the nation. We look forward to working with you as we continue our efforts to provide a complementary PNT capability for U.S. critical infrastructure. We have sent a similar response to each cosigner of your letter. Sincerely, Victor M. Mendez, Deputy Secretary of Transportation, Co-Chair, National Executive Committee for Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing. Robert O. Work, Deputy Secretary of Defense, Co-Chair, National Executive Committee for Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing. ____ [From the DHS Science & Technology Press Office, Apr. 20, 2016] DHS S&T Demonstrates Precision Timing Technology at the New York Stock Exchange Washington.--The Department of Homeland security, Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) announced today the successful demonstration of the Enhanced Loren (eLoran), a precision-timing technology for financial transactions at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). eLoran is a low-frequency, high-power radio navigation signal that is broadcasted by ground-based transmission stations, allowing the signal to penetrate through buildings and provide precision timing indoors and throughout urban environments. ``Accurate position, navigation, and timing is necessary for the function and integrity of many critical infrastructure sectors, such as the electric grid, communication networks, and financial institutions,'' said DHS Under Secretary for Science and Technology Dr. Reginald Brothers. ``Ensuring the continuous and uninterrupted availability of critical information ensures our national security.'' [[Page H5904]] DHS S&T, U.S. Coast Guard, UrsaNav, Inc., and Harris Corporation study eLoran through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement for applicability to provide timing information for critical infrastructure applications. The demonstration at the NYSE was hosted by Juniper Networks on April 19 and presented to technical representatives from the financial services, energy, and communication sectors. We are constantly working with critical infrastructure partners like the financial sector to help build their capabilities and resilience to a variety of hazards, including space weather and other cyber or physical threats to the system's continuity,'' stated DHS Assistant Secretary for Infrastructure Protection Caitlin Durkovich. Precise and synchronized timing of financial transactions is critical to markets worldwide and is mandated by regulation in the European Union and is increasingly required in the United States. Today, precision timing capabilities are provided primarily by satellite-based Global Positioning System (GPS). However, GPS's space-based signals are low- power and susceptible to possible disruptions. GPS signals are also difficult to receive indoors and in urban canyons. ``During the technology demonstration inside the NYSE building, we were able to not only provide signals indoors but also provide timing information to within 30 nanoseconds of our UTC reference,'' said Sarah Mahmood, S&T program manager for the eLoran cooperation agreement. Recognizing the challenges of space-based signals and the importance of having multiple timing-sources, eLoran is one technology being considered to provide a complementary timing solution to existing GPS technology. ____ [From the Atlantic, June 13, 2016] What Happens If GPS Fails? (By Dan Glass) It only took thirteen millionths of a second to cause a whole lot of problems. Last January, as the U.S. Air Force was taking one satellite in the country's constellation of GPS satellites offline, an incorrect time was accidentally uploaded to several others, making them out of sync by less time than it takes for the sound of a gunshot to leave the chamber. The minute error disrupted GPS-dependent timing equipment around the world for more than 12 hours. While the problem went unnoticed by many people thanks to short-term backup systems, panicked engineers in Europe called equipment makers to help resolve things before global telecommunications networks began to fail. In parts of the U.S and Canada, police, fire, and EMS radio equipment stopped functioning. BBC digital radio was out for two days in many areas, and the anomaly was even detected in electrical power grids. Despite its name, the Global Positioning System is not about maps; it's about time. Each satellite in the constellation (24 are needed, plus the U.S. has several spares) has multiple atomic clocks on board, synchronized with each other and to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)--the time standard used across the world--down to the nanosecond. The satellites continually broadcast their time and position information down to Earth, where GPS receivers in equipment from iPhones to automated tractors acquire signals and use the minuscule differences in their arrival time to determine an exact position. While GPS was initially conceived to aid navigation, globally synchronized time is now a much more critical function of the system. Telecom networks rely on GPS clocks to keep cell towers synchronized so calls can be passed between them. Many electrical power grids use the clocks in equipment that fine-tunes current flow in overloaded networks. The finance sector uses GPS-derived timing systems to timestamp ATM, credit card, and high-speed market transactions. Computer network synchronization, digital television and radio, Doppler radar weather reporting, seismic monitoring, even multi-camera sequencing for film production--GPS clocks have a hand in all. But last January's system failure brings up an often- ignored question: What if all these flying clock radios were wiped out, and everything on the ground started blinking 12:00? According to Mike Lombardi, a metrologist at the National Institute for Standards and Technology, ``Nobody knows exactly what would happen.'' Since so many of these technologies were designed specifically with GPS in mind, the unsettling truth, he says, is ``there's no backup.'' This isn't a secret. Concern for the consequences of the country's reliance on this invisible utility has been growing among industry and government workers for more than 15 years, after the Department of Transportation issued a report on the need for a backup navigation system, in 2001. But while the means to create one has existed since, a winding bureaucratic path has kept it from actually being implemented. And that leaves many of the everyday tools society depends on vulnerable until one is. There are plenty of reasons GPS could fail. Intentional attack is one, as emphasized by a declassified 2012 risk estimate by the Department of Homeland Security. One of the system's most basic problems is its signals are weak enough to be easily obstructed. Truckers with cheap jamming devices designed to elude employer tracking have unintentionally interfered with airport systems; criminals thwarting GPS tags on stolen goods in shipping containers have accidentally shut down port operations. On a grander scale, North Korea has tormented South Korea with waves of jamming attacks. (jamming devices are now illegal in the U.S., but not difficult to obtain illicitly.) A few steps up from jamming devices in both complexity and damage are spoofers: systems that get GPS receivers to lock on to mimicked signal. Spoofers don't trigger equipment alarms, and deliver altered time and position information to unaware users. It's been suggested that Iran used this tactic to lead astray two U.S. Navy patrol boats captured in the Gulf last January. A plausible worst-case attack scenario would look something like this: Spoofers feed erroneous data to electrical substation equipment in a metro area, which could overheat power lines and transformers, causing widespread outages. Meanwhile, multiple hidden jammers could cripple cellphone service, and also force fire, police, and emergency medicine departments to revert to old, single-frequency channels. Supplies in this scenario could only be bought in many places with cash, which would be limited without ATM service. According to the DHS report, it could take 30 days or more before the malicious devices are located and disabled. The longer it took, the more systems that would be compromised. As for unintentional threats to GPS, the DHS risk estimate lists space debris, space weather, defective software, and good old-fashioned human mistakes, among other things. Of these threats, space weather is the most potentially catastrophic, according to Norwegian geophysicist Pal Brekke, whose country was hardest hit by the January outage. Eruptions of high energy radiation from the sun (known as solar flares) and ejections of electrically charged gases have disabled satellites in the past. With satellites and the chips inside them getting smaller as technology progresses, ``one particle from the sun that penetrates a satellite can ruin things,'' Brekke says. ``It wouldn't take that large of an event to take out all GPS.'' So far, mitigating the loss of GPS signals has involved two approaches. One is interoperability with other global navigation satellite systems like Russia's GLONASS (which also failed due to a ground control error in 2014) or the European and Chinese systems, both of which are expected to be up by 2020. The other is better clocks, says Lombardi, the NIST metrologist, who's published numerous articles on the topic. ``The typical cell tower clock has an oscillator similar to that of a wristwatch,'' he says, ``and can drift out of tolerance in minutes without a signal.'' How long a clock can maintain time on its own, called ``holdover,'' also affects electrical grids, many of which rely on GPS-dependent devices called synchrophasors used to precisely regulate current flow, as well as help locate faults in the network. A lack of such timing technology was the reason it took some Canadian technicians three months to locate failures after the infamous blackout of 2003. Chip-scale atomic clocks the size of a penny are a promising new technology that can hold time for about a day, but are currently too expensive to deploy widely. Moreover, hedging and holdover still aren't backups for when space- based signals are simply unavailable. The bulk of a more promising, comprehensive backup system already exists, right here on the ground. After the sextant but before GPS, navigators around the world used Long Range Aids to Navigation, or ``LORAN,'' a terrestrial system of transmitters and receiving equipment first developed during WWII. By the mid-1990s, Loran ``tower chains'' provided coverage for North America, Europe, and other regions in the Northern Hemisphere. Its use declined in favor of the much finer accuracy of GPS after it became available for civil use in 1995, but the U.S. Coast Guard continued working on an improved system using the existing infrastructure. If adopted, ``Enhanced'' LORAN, or eLoran, could provide positioning accuracy comparable to GPS. Broadcast at hundreds of thousands of watts, the signal is virtually un-jammable, and unlike GPS, can even be received indoors, underwater, and in urban or natural canyons. It also turns out that eLoran can provide a UTC time signal with sub-microsecond time resolution across a large geographical area. The technology is available--the Coast Guard demonstrated a working prototype last year--so why isn't America using it? John Garamendi, a California congressman, asked this question at a July 2015 congressional hearing on the Federal Radionavigation Plan, the nation's primary planning document for position, navigation, and timing (PNT). ``There are two kinds of time,'' he opened, ``real time . . . and then federal time, which seems to be the forever time. The e-Loran system was identified as a backup 15 years ago, and here we are, federal time, not yet done.'' Cost doesn't seem to be a problem. A complete alternate PNT system is estimated at $350 million to $400 million; it costs $1 billion yearly to maintain GPS. And science and industry appears to share a consensus that eLoran is the solution. Even the Air Force Colonel and engineer who created GPS, Brad Parkinson, had been on record for years saying ``eLoran is the only cost-effective backup for national needs.'' In a 2004, a presidential directive tasked DHS and DOT with creating a backup to the GPS system. In 2008, the DHS issued a press [[Page H5905]] release that it was committing to the system and transferred control from the Coast Guard to its National Protection and Programs Directorate. But push and pull between DHS and the Coast Guard appears to have slowed progress. After this year's satellite error, many European officials who had previously followed America's reluctance to adopt eLoran stepped up development. Meanwhile, pressure from Garamendi, who argued in his address that ``without an eLoran system in place ASAP, this country is in serious, serious jeopardy,'' prompted a letter to him from the Deputy Secretaries of Defense and Transportation informing that the PNT Executive Committee has agreed that an eLoran-based timing network ``could provide a near term solution'' (if private entities bore some of the cost) while they ``continue [their] efforts to prescribe a complete set of requirements necessary to support a full complementary PNT capability for the nation.'' In other words, it seems: federal time. Why is the sense of urgency among decision-makers so out of sync? Could some of it be similar to why people delay backing up our computers even though they've been telling themselves to for weeks? How do we decide, when presented a risk with unknown odds, when it's time to sacrifice time and resources to prevent it? Now is a critically important time to answer that question, as the world actually been given odds on another, even more catastrophic risk than GPS failure: destruction of the electrical power infrastructure itself. On July 23, 2012, a billion-ton cloud of electrified gases blasted off the far side of the sun at over six million miles per hour. According to professor Daniel Baker at University of Colorado, this coronal mass ejection (CME) ``was in all respects at least as strong as the 1859 Carrington Event,'' referring to the strongest solar storm ever recorded, which set fire to telegraph stations and caused auroras down to Cuba. As was widely reported two years ago, if the 2012 CME had occurred one week later, it would have hit Earth. Space Katrina would be biblically catastrophic. Power could be out for years while electrical transformers were repaired, if the resources are even available to do so. ``Collateral effects of a longer-term outage would likely include disruption of the transportation, communication, banking, and finance systems, and government services; the breakdown of the distribution of potable water owing to pump failure; and the loss of perishable foods and medications because of lack of refrigeration,'' reads a 2008 National Academy of Sciences report. In 2014, physicist from San Diego calculated the likelihood of a Carrington-level event in the next decade. The odds he came up with were 12 percent. The predicament of events like this is not that they're occurring more frequently, but that the rapid development of technology is opening the tools on which humanity depends to an increasingly wide variety of rare but potentially destructive cosmic threats. In the span of a century, we've transferred much of the weight of modern society to global infrastructures with wobbly legs. If they collapse, time will very quickly appear to move backward. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5978, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter). General Leave Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 5978. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, before we talk about H.R. 5978, I would like to talk about what is not in this bill, which is probably one of the most important things that is my duty, Mr. Garamendi's duty, and the Coast Guard's duty to get done--and that is build a polar icebreaker. Let me tell you why there is no polar icebreaker in this bill: the CBO couldn't get their act together in time to score this one way or another. So, again, this body is held ransom by the Congressional Budget Office not scoring something one way or another, whether it is good to go or not. The reason it is so important that we have more polar icebreakers and that we included the language that passed the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee last week is this: we do not have 24/7, 365- day polar icebreaking ability for the Arctic. The Russians have over 40 polar icebreakers. That is over 40, some of which are even nuclear. China has got more than 20 now. The United States only has one that is capable of crushing heavy ice, and even that is not available 24/7, 365. The High Latitude Region Mission Analysis revealed the following Coast Guard missions--defense readiness; ice operations; marine environmental protection; and ports, waterways, and coastal security in the Arctic--were significantly impacted by the gap in this mission performance. It is these gaps and the knowledge that, when the Polar Star reaches the end of its extended service life, we will have a period where the Coast Guard doesn't have a heavy icebreaker at all, let alone what it has now, which is limited capability in the Arctic. Progress is being made on the acquisition front. Mr. Garamendi and I and the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee granted the Coast Guard the capability to do block buys, which is what the Navy has, where you can purchase more than one vessel at a time, which saves billions of dollars. We also gave them the ability to have lead-time materials, which means they could buy the materials way in advance, which would save tens of millions of dollars. The Coast Guard now has this ability for the FRC and the OPC. We want them to have it for the icebreaker as well, but because of the CBO not scoring this, we weren't able to get the language in. Here is the specific language that is missing from H.R. 5978: ``The Commandant of the Coast Guard, subject to the availability of amounts specifically provided in advance in subsequent appropriations acts may enter into a contract for the acquisition of no less than three heavy polar icebreakers; and may enter into a contract for acquisition of additional polar icebreakers, except that the total number of icebreakers acquired under this subsection may not exceed six.'' We are talking about three. Right now we have one. ``Such acquisitions may be made through block buy contracts; may be incrementally funded; may include combined purchases, also known as economic order quantity purchases, of materials and components; and long lead time materials; and may include advance construction funding.'' This is what the Navy has for every ship that they make. This is one reason we created a joint program office between the Coast Guard and the Navy, so that the Navy can push the Coast Guard to do the right thing. The Coast Guard, let it be said, at the best, has been dragging their feet on acquiring these icebreakers. In fact, they have been pushing back against Congress every inch of the way on this. In my point of view, this is just like UAVs, or the unmanned aerial vehicles that we have now, Predators and the like. Congress earmarked those because the Air Force did not want pilotless airplanes. Then you would have to get rid of pilots. So the Air Force pushed back day and night in the late nineties and this Congress earmarked Predator drones. That is why we have Predator drones. The military pushed back against Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles, also known as MRAP vehicles, which have saved thousands of lives in Iraq and Afghanistan, also pushed by Congress, not the U.S. military. In things like this, Congress is able to see things outside the box, which the Coast Guard cannot in this case. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter) has been an extraordinary leader on trying to address a critical need that the United States has. The Arctic Ocean is opening. There is not only a Northwest Passage, but there is a Northeast Passage. And this year, just a couple of weeks ago--less than 2 weeks ago--a cruise ship passed through the Northwest Passage without the aid of an icebreaker. We absolutely have to have a polar icebreaker. As the chairman said, we have one icebreaker today, and it is going to go in for overhaul. When it does, we have no heavy icebreaker either for the North Pole or the South Pole. We are in trouble. We have to have this. The U.S. Navy has to have it. U.S. security has to have it. And certainly for the commerce in the Arctic, we have to have it. It is a reality. The Arctic Ocean is opening. Commerce will take place. And it will also need military availability in that area. The legislation that is before us today does not have the proper language in it because of CBO sitting on [[Page H5898]] their duff and doodling numbers when we know we need this language. The Senate appropriations bill has a billion dollars for icebreakers, but there is no authorization. Unfortunately, because of our rules here, we had to strip the language out. Later, we hope to put the language back in, but it is not available today. We have to have this. We go back meeting after meeting, hearing after hearing, year after year, 4 or 5 years that we have been working on this, and then, at the very last moment, CBO can't get its act together. Well, I am sorry, CBO. We ought to waive the rules and get on with what we need to do here, which is to provide the authorization. The language that the chairman has worked out with me and others would not only provide the authorization, but would do it in such a way as to give us the very best possible financial deal on the construction of icebreakers--that is a block buy--and also authorizing, should the money be available in the future, an additional three lighter icebreakers beyond the three heavy icebreakers. Not to say we are going to build it all at once, but the authorization is in the law. That then allows the Coast Guard to properly line it up for the very best deal that we can get, maybe one at a time, maybe two or three over a 5- or 10-year period of time. Unfortunately, that language had to be stripped out. So when the chairman started his explanation of this bill, he did so to call all of our attention to what is not in the bill that should have been in the bill, but for CBO and the rules that we have that require us to have CBO's accounting before we move an authorization. That is where we are today. Unfortunately, it is where we are. So we are going to move this bill along. We will probably--hopefully--come back before this session is over in the lameduck session and write this thing properly. Unfortunately, today we are not there. There is more to be said about the rest of the bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, now we are going to get back to H.R. 5978, which is a very good bill in and of itself that, once again, doesn't have the language that we tried to get in. H.R. 5978, the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Amendments Act of 2016, is a catch-all bill that addresses a number of different Coast Guard and maritime transportation issues. The bill involves improvements to the Coast Guard acquisition authorities to ensure the acquisition program keeps in mind the needs of Coast Guard operating units when acquiring assets. This provision also requires an analysis on the use of multiyear procurement and block buy authorities related to the purchase of Fast Response Cutters, Offshore Patrol Cutters, and polar icebreakers, but just a report. We already know from watching the Navy do business for the last few decades that block buys save hundreds of millions of dollars. At the request of the GAO, the bill repeals a GAO report regarding disbursements from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. The information that was collected by GAO will be incorporated into an existing Coast Guard report. Due to certain recent weather events impacting a Coast Guard pier in Wilmington, North Carolina, the Coast Guard is required to issue a one- time report detailing short- and long-term plans to replace and maintain the pier. Certain fishing industries will be assisted by the bill, including those that would be affected by a prescribed Alternative Safety Compliance Program to be issued by the Coast Guard by January 1, 2017. If the service does not issue the program by January 1, 2017, which is hopefully the case, the bill would provide a 3-year window for industry compliance from the date the Coast Guard issues the program. It has been a long-term interest for many, including Ranking Member Garamendi, who has been instrumental--and I would say more instrumental than myself--in preparing the language included in this legislation that there be a reliable land-based positioning, navigation, and timing system to complement, supplement, and back up the Global Positioning System that we now use, the GPS. We have all seen what the Chinese can do now in knocking down satellites. If our GPS goes out, there is no other way for us to navigate the oceans or to navigate land. The eLoran system does this to ensure the continuous availability of uncorrupted or non-degraded signals for military and civilian users. The bill directed the Coast Guard to establish and maintain such a backup system. {time} 1915 Aids to navigation are important tools that allow vessels to safely navigate waterways. The bill would allow the Commandant, subject to appropriations, to reimburse a non-Federal entity for costs incurred by that entity to construct and establish an aid to navigation that would otherwise be constructed by the Coast Guard. Aids to navigation facilitate safe and efficient maritime transportation on federally authorized navigation channels. Specific conditions for reimbursement are outlined. Reimbursements for a single project are limited to $5 million, and the authority expires 4 years after the date of enactment of the bill. There are concerns with the Coast Guard's Western Alaska Captain of the Port Zone approving alternate planning criteria for areas covering only a portion of the zone. This action would create two adjacent areas with different levels of prevention and response preparedness. This bill requires public notice, an economic study, and a report to Congress on the study before approval of any criteria not covering the full Western Alaska zone. Lastly, the bill makes a variety of technical changes to provisions in enacted Coast Guard Authorization Acts. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. (Mr. GARAMENDI asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I join Chairman Hunter in strong support for the legislation and to advance this new policy initiative to improve the oversight of the Coast Guard and the major acquisition programs, and also to advance the safety and security of the U.S. maritime industry. H.R. 5978, the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Amendments Act, is bipartisan legislation. We have talked about some of the provisions that are not in the bill. I will try to talk about those that are in the bill. It deserves the robust support from Members on both sides of the aisle, and I urge its quick passage, probably as early as today. I thank the gentleman, Mr. Hunter, for his unwavering support of the Coast Guard and the work that we are able to do together with the members of the committee. Of great significance, this legislation will address an overlooked and underappreciated threat to our national and economic security: the fact that GPS, Global Positioning System, it has been identified for nearly 20 years as the single point of failure, with serious implications for our national security and economy. I know we are not able to use these little machines called cell phones on the floor, but if we could, they are totally reliant on GPS. You go down to the ATM, it will not work without GPS. Our systems of navigation, including such things as positive train control, totally dependent upon GPS. In fact, Wall Street, totally dependent on GPS. It is timing, navigation, and positioning. That is GPS. We have no backup; other countries do. You might ask, why is China, why is Russia, why are they building a GLAN-based backup to GPS? Well, they know that if there is trouble, the first thing that is going to disappear is GPS. Right now, GPS can be knocked out by somebody driving down the freeway with their 18-wheeler and using an antiradar device. You might ask what happened at the Newark airport. That is exactly what happened. GPS was knocked out by somebody on Interstate 95 with a radar device. It is a very weak signal, but it is an extraordinarily important signal. So this bill provides for a backup system which has been discussed for nearly 20 [[Page H5899]] years, and we have gone round and round the Bush--I guess that is the right thing--and the Clinton, in between, without any action. So this bill would actually push this forward to give us an opportunity to establish a backup system, which is actually very old but will be updated with the enhanced LORAN system, dating back to the 1940s, which was the first navigational system that we built in the United States. Much of the system is already available; the towers, the locations, much of that is in place. This would authorize a public-private partnership to put that in place. I won't go into it anymore, but it is high time that we get on with this. The chairman laid out how it is going to be done in his talk and, hopefully, we can finally get this underway. There are many, many other pieces that are in this legislation. We have talked a little bit about the Coast Guard icebreakers. We do have a study--oh, my goodness, another study. It is the best we could do at the moment. The chairman and I talked about what we would like to accomplish with more than that with his actual authorization. The block buy, we have got to do it, and, hopefully, we will. There are other things that are in the bill that the chairman has described. I won't go into them today in any more detail but to say that, in my written statement, it will be covered. One more thing, to back up the GPS, I include in the Record about 15 years of studies by Federal Government agencies that all say we have got to have a backup system, and the eLORAN is the best. Mr. Chairman, shall we continue on and beat this for a while longer or shall we say let's pass the bill and get on with it? I am pleased to rise and join Chairman Hunter in strong support of this legislation to advance new policy initiatives to improve the oversight of the Coast Guard's major acquisition programs and to advance the safety and security of the U.S. maritime industry. H.R. 5978, the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Amendments Act of 2016, is bipartisan legislation that was developed to address issues that have arisen since the Congress passed a two-year comprehensive Coast Guard authorization bill earlier this year. This legislation is deserving of robust support from members on both sides of the aisle and I urge its quick passage by the House today so it can be sent to the other body for its consideration and passage before the 114th Congress adjourns sine die. I want to thank Chairman Hunter for his unwavering leadership and for the cooperative spirit of this excellent staff in working with me and other Democratic members to address our interests and concerns in this legislation. Of greatest significance, this legislation will address an overlooked need and under-appreciated threat to our national and economic security--the fact that the Global Positioning System, or GPS, has been identified as a single point of failure with serious implications for our national security and economy. GPS has revolutionized how we live, work, and play. Signals provided by GPS satellites ensure that literally everything that we routinely depend on not only runs, but runs with unprecedented reliability and precision. We have all benefitted from GPS: whether through the distribution of power from our electric grid; the coordination of timing signals for trains and traffic signals; or, to improve the efficiency of maritime search and rescue missions launched by the Coast Guard. There is no denying that GPS has been a tremendous technological asset. But the reality is that GPS signals are relatively weak and fairly easy to degrade, disrupt or jam. This is not a hypothetical matter; this threat is real, and it is happening now. Just last week, the Commandant of the Coast Guard, Admiral Paul Zukunft, while speaking at a National Harbor Safety Conference in Portland, Oregon, cited over 100 instances in which vessels experienced disruption to their GPS reception. There is nothing we can do to change the underlying physics of the GPS signal. We can, however, take necessary and appropriate actions now to ensure that a reliable land-based back-up system for positioning, navigation and timing signals is available when needed. Moreover, if the Russians, the Chinese, the EU, and other nations are developing land-based GPS back-up systems, the United States should have its own system as well. Since 2001 the Federal Government, notably the PNT Executive Committee, has been evaluating options. The Executive Committee concluded in December, 2014 that an enhanced LORAN, or eLORAN system, would be the most cost-effective and reliable back-up for GPS signals. What this legislation will do is force the Federal Government to finally take action on its own recommendation. The Coast Guard, which for decades operated the LORAN-C navigation system (the predecessor of GPS), would be directed to publish a request for proposals, complete a plan for the architecture of an eLORAN system, and get a system built and fully operational within three years. Make no mistake, this is a significant undertaking. But the stakes of doing nothing is a risky roll of the dice we would be well-advised to avoid. I strongly urge members on both sides to support this important provision. I am also very pleased that this legislation continues to move forward in our efforts to recapitalize the Coast Guard's legacy fleet of polar class heavy icebreakers. It is clear that we are witnessing the opening of the Arctic to maritime commerce, and with it, the creation of a whole new ocean of operational responsibility for the Coast Guard. In this most challenging of maritime environments, it is vital that the Service has the icebreaking capabilities it will need to operate safely and effectively. I must express my disappointment that we were unable to retain the ``block buy'' provision that was reported out of the Transportation Committee. Nevertheless, the analysis of multi-year procurement and block buy contracting called for in this legislation would be helpful to have on hand when the Congress ultimately does appropriate funds for the construction of these vital new national security assets. I also want to express my support for other provisions in the bill, notably language that will ensure commercial fishermen a full three years to comply with new alternative safety compliance program requirements from the date the Coast Guard publishes these requirements. Additionally, I want to express my support for the provision that would grant to the Coast Guard authority to reimburse private entities for their costs to construct a Federal navigation aid. The additional sideboards that were added have clarified the scope and intent of this new authority. I want to thank Congressman Blake Farenthold for his willingness to work to improve this provision. Mr. Speaker, I again want to express my appreciation to Chairman Hunter and his staff for their support for the Coast Guard and the U.S. Maritime industry, and for their collaboration in developing this legislation. I also want to thank the Chairman of the full Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Congressman Bill Shuster, and the Ranking Member on the full Committee, Congressman Peter DeFazio, for their leadership and support for the Committee's maritime agenda. In closing, this legislation is bipartisan and non-controversial. It deserves the full support of the House. NSPD-39: U.S. Space-Based Position, Navigation, and Timing Policy, December 15, 2004 FACT SHEET The President authorized a new national policy on December 8, 2004 that establishes guidance and implementation actions for space-based positioning, navigation, and timing programs, augmentations, and activities for U.S. national and homeland security, civil, scientific, and commercial purposes. This policy supersedes Presidential Decision Directive/National Science and Technology Council-6, U.S. Global Positioning System Policy, dated March 28, 1996. I. Scope and Definitions This policy provides guidance for: (1) development, acquisition, operation, sustainment, and modernization of the Global Positioning System and U.S.-developed, owned and/or operated systems used to augment or otherwise improve the Global Positioning System and/or other space-based positioning, navigation, and timing signals; (2) development, deployment, sustainment, and modernization of capabilities to protect U.S. and allied access to and use of the Global Positioning System for national, homeland, and economic security, and to deny adversaries access to any space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services; and (3) foreign access to the Global Positioning System and United States Government augmentations, and international cooperation with foreign space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services, including augmentations. For purposes of this document: ``Interoperable'' refers to the ability of civil U.S. and foreign space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services to be used together to provide better capabilities at the user level than would be achieved by relying solely on one service or signal; ``Compatible'' refers to the ability of U.S. and foreign space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services to be used separately or together without interfering with each individual service or signal, and without adversely affecting navigation warfare; and ``Augmentation'' refers to space and/or ground-based systems that provide users of space-based positioning, navigation, and timing signals with additional information [[Page H5900]] that enables users to obtain enhanced performance when compared to the un-augmented space-based signals alone. These improvements include better accuracy, availability, integrity, and reliability, with independent integrity monitoring and alerting capabilities for critical applications. II. Background Over the past decade, the Global Positioning System has grown into a global utility whose multiuse services are integral to U.S. national security, economic growth, transportation safety, and homeland security, and are an essential element of the worldwide economic infrastructure. In the year 2000, the United States recognized the increasing importance of the Global Positioning System to civil and commercial users by discontinuing the deliberate degradation of accuracy for non-military signals, known as Selective Availability. Since that time, commercial and civil applications of the Global Positioning System have continued to multiply and their importance has increased significantly. Services dependent on Global Positioning System information are now an engine for economic growth, enhancing economic development, and improving safety of life, and the system is a key component of multiple sectors of U.S. critical infrastructure. While the growth in civil and commercial applications continues, the positioning, navigation, and timing information provided by the Global Positioning System remains critical to U.S. national security, and its applications are integrated into virtually every facet of U.S. military operations. United States and allied military forces will continue to rely on the Global Positioning System military services for positioning, navigation, and timing services. The continuing growth of services based on the Global Positioning System presents opportunities, risks, and threats to U.S. national, homeland, and economic security. The widespread and growing dependence on the Global Positioning System of military, civil, and commercial systems and infrastructures has made many of these systems inherently vulnerable to an unexpected interruption in positioning, navigation, and/or timing services. In addition, whether designed for military capabilities or not, all positioning, navigation, and timing signals from space and their augmentations provide inherent capabilities that can be used by adversaries, including enemy military forces and terrorist groups. Finally, emerging foreign space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services could enhance or undermine the future utility of the Global Positioning System. The United States must continue to improve and maintain the Global Positioning System, augmentations, and backup capabilities to meet growing national, homeland, and economic security requirements, for civil requirements, and to meet commercial and scientific demands. In parallel, we must continue to improve capabilities to deny adversary access to all space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services, particularly including services that are openly available and can be readily used by adversaries and/or terrorists to threaten the security of the United States. In addition, the diverse requirements for and multiple applications of space- based positioning, navigation, and timing services require stable yet adaptable policies and management mechanisms. The existing management mechanisms for the Global Positioning System and its augmentations must be modified to accommodate a multi-use approach to program planning, resource allocation, system development, and operations. Therefore, the United States Government must improve the policy and management framework governing the Global Positioning System and its augmentations to support their continued ability to meet increasing and varied domestic and global requirements. III. Goals and Objectives The fundamental goal of this policy is to ensure that the United States maintains space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services, augmentation, back-up, and service denial capabilities that: (1) provide uninterrupted availability of positioning, navigation, and timing services; (2) meet growing national, homeland, economic security, and civil requirements, and scientific and commercial demands; (3) remain the pre-eminent military space-based positioning, navigation, and timing service; (4) continue to provide civil services that exceed or are competitive with foreign civil space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services and augmentation systems; (5) remain essential components of internationally accepted positioning, navigation, and timing services; and (6) promote U.S. technological leadership in applications involving space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services. To achieve this goal, the United States Government shall: Provide uninterrupted access to U.S. space-based global, precise positioning, navigation, and timing services for U.S. and allied national security systems and capabilities through the Global Positioning System, without being dependent on foreign positioning, navigation, and timing services; Provide on a continuous, worldwide basis civil space-based, positioning, navigation, and timing services free of direct user fees for civil, commercial, and scientific uses, and for homeland security through the Global Positioning System and its augmentations, and provide open, free access to information necessary to develop and build equipment to use these services; Improve capabilities to deny hostile use of any space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services, without unduly disrupting civil and commercial access to civil positioning, navigation, and timing services outside an area of military operations, or for homeland security purposes; Improve the performance of space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services, including more robust resistance to interference for, and consistent with, U.S. and allied national security purposes, homeland security, and civil, commercial, and scientific users worldwide; Maintain the Global Positioning System as a component of multiple sectors of the U.S. Critical Infrastructure, consistent with Homeland Security Presidential Directive-7, Critical Infrastructure Identification, Prioritization, and Protection, dated December 17, 2003; Encourage foreign development of positioning, navigation, and timing services and systems based on the Global Positioning System. Seek to ensure that foreign space-based positioning, navigation, and timing systems are interoperable with the civil services of the Global Positioning System and its augmentations in order to benefit civil, commercial, and scientific users worldwide. At a minimum, seek to ensure that foreign systems are compatible with the Global Positioning System and its augmentations and address mutual security concerns with foreign providers to prevent hostile use of space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services; and Promote the use of U.S. space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services and capabilities for applications at the Federal, State, and local level, to the maximum practical extent.

Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Farenthold). Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill. There are a lot of good things in it for the Nation. As a former computer technician, I know there is nothing worse than a single point of failure in the network. GPS is a single point of failure for a lot of things; eLORAN is absolutely must-have. We can talk about what is not in the bill as well, but I do want to talk about a section that is specifically important to the district I represent. Section 202 grants the authority for the Coast Guard to reimburse non-Federal entities for the cost of construction to certain aids to navigation. This authority ensures these types of safety-related navigation projects can move forward in a timely fashion. We are all too aware of how slow the government can be, especially when it comes to funding projects, so we have come up with a way here where we can work with non-Federal partners to improve the safety of our navigation system. It doesn't cost the government anything. The non-Federal partners go ahead and put in the equipment up to Coast Guard standards with Coast Guard approval and get it done now; and then, when the Coast Guard gets the money, when the red tape and government machine moves through its procedure, they can get reimbursed, while our mariners can enjoin the enhanced safety and our ports can enjoy [[Page H5903]] the enhanced economic activity as a result of being able to, for instance, traverse channels in low-light conditions. It is safety. It is good for the economy. In fact, one of the problems that brought this to my attention was when there was a project in Corpus Christi, the La Quinta Channel. Somehow, the aids to navigation never got built, even though this channel has been dredged and is in use. The pilots say it is unsafe to use in low-light conditions, and it looks like it could be years before the Coast Guard gets around to funding it. Well, the Port of Corpus Christi is willing to pony up the money today. The Coast Guard says: All right; when we get it, we will give it back. This piece of legislation allows that to happen. It is good government, along with lots of other pieces of this legislation, something we need to pass, and I urge my colleagues to git-r-done. Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. We need polar icebreakers. This body is going to push; Mr. Garamendi and I are going to push and push until we have polar icebreakers and we have at least \1/140\ the capability of Russia. That is a pretty low bar that we are setting for ourselves, but we are going to set it right here, right now, in this body. Let's at least have \1/140\ of the capability or Russia, build those polar icebreakers. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support H.R. 5978. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following materials: Exelis, UrsaNav, the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Coast Guard Enter Agreement to Trial Ground-Based Position, Navigation and Timing Signal Herndon, VA, May 22, 2015.--Exelis (NYSE: XLS), UrsaNav, Inc., the Department of Homeland Security's Science and Technology Directorate (DHS S&T), and the U.S. Coast Guard have entered into a cooperative research and development agreement (CRADA) for testing and demonstration at former LORAN-C sites. These sites are the legacy ground-based radio navigation infrastructure of the decommissioned LORAN-C service that could be retained and upgraded to provide eLORAN low frequency service. The team will evaluate eLORAN as a potential complementary system to the current Global Positioning System (GPS) currently in wide use throughout the United States. The capabilities and potential utilization methods of eLORAN will be explored in depth to identify all strengths, capacities, and potential vulnerabilities of the technology. Under the CRADA, Exelis will use the former LORAN-C assets to put eLORAN signals in space for research, test and demonstration of the ability of eLORAN to meet precise positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) requirements of government and privately-owned critical infrastructure. The first station Exelis will broadcast from is located in Wildwood, NJ. The broadcast will provide a usable signal at a range up to 1000 miles. ``eLORAN is an ideal technology to complement GPS for critical, resilient and assured PNT,'' said Ed Sayadian, vice president of Civil & Aerospace Systems for Exelis. ``eLORAN is a difficult to disrupt technology that offers PNT and wide area broadcast data capabilities indoors, in underground locations and other GPS-denied environments.'' ``A preponderance of government, academic, and industry reports have concluded that eLORAN is the best independent, multi-modal solution to provide assured PNT as a complement to GPS,'' said Chuck Schue, president and CEO of UrsaNay. Exelis and UrsaNav have entered into this CRADA because they believe that low frequency signals, such as eLORAN, operate independently of GPS signals and can provide alternative timing, either standalone, or as a component of a PNT service. Exelis also believes that as a result of its wealth of experience in its PNT portfolio, that there are many civil and defense applications that require precise time and/or position in GPS-denied environments. Examples include radio frequency interference, both intentional and unintentional; signal attenuation from heavy forest canopy, terrain or buildings; and indoor and underground locations.

Dear Congressman DeFazio: Thank you for your August 31, 2015, letter regarding the importance of the Global Positioning System (GPS) and the need for a complementary positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) capability for the nation. We share your concerns regarding the importance of GPS to our critical infrastructure and security requirements. Seeking to implement the guidance from National Security Presidential Directive 39, the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Transportation established an interagency process in 2014 to assess those information sources that are complementary to GPS and that could be used to ensure the continuity of PNT services to critical infrastructure. Through this interagency process, the National Space-Based PNT Executive Committee (EXCOM) reviewed several potential solutions and assessed that an enhanced Loran (eLoran) network could be a viable nationwide complementary capability for GPS applications in U.S. critical infrastructure. The EXCOM also assessed that a timing-focused network could be implemented in the near term with properly scoped specifications, costs, and cost sharing arrangements. As you stated, there may be opportunities to work with private and commercial entities to initiate these complementary capabilities. The EXCOM met on September 3, 2015, and agreed to a two- fold strategy for activities to explore a national complementary capability to GPS: pursue potential near-term opportunities to leverage public and private sector capabilities and resources to support a timing-focused eLoran network, while also documenting the requirements for a more comprehensive complementary PNT capability for the nation's critical infrastructure. The EXCOM acknowledges the challenges associated with this undertaking, especially given the fact that no government- wide set of requirements has been established for such a complementary capability. However, sufficient data exists from previous studies to produce initial cost estimates and basic system specifications to determine the appropriate scope of the effort. We are building on these data and estimates to develop a more detailed approach for an initial timing-focused eLoran capability. This initial timing network could provide a near-term solution while we continue our efforts to prescribe a complete set of requirements necessary to support a full complementary PNT capability for the nation. We look forward to working with you as we continue our efforts to provide a complementary PNT capability for U.S. critical infrastructure. We have sent a similar response to each cosigner of your letter. Sincerely, Victor M. Mendez, Deputy Secretary of Transportation, Co-Chair, National Executive Committee for Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing. Robert O. Work, Deputy Secretary of Defense, Co-Chair, National Executive Committee for Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing. ____ [From the DHS Science & Technology Press Office, Apr. 20, 2016] DHS S&T Demonstrates Precision Timing Technology at the New York Stock Exchange Washington.--The Department of Homeland security, Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) announced today the successful demonstration of the Enhanced Loren (eLoran), a precision-timing technology for financial transactions at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). eLoran is a low-frequency, high-power radio navigation signal that is broadcasted by ground-based transmission stations, allowing the signal to penetrate through buildings and provide precision timing indoors and throughout urban environments. ``Accurate position, navigation, and timing is necessary for the function and integrity of many critical infrastructure sectors, such as the electric grid, communication networks, and financial institutions,'' said DHS Under Secretary for Science and Technology Dr. Reginald Brothers. ``Ensuring the continuous and uninterrupted availability of critical information ensures our national security.'' [[Page H5904]] DHS S&T, U.S. Coast Guard, UrsaNav, Inc., and Harris Corporation study eLoran through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement for applicability to provide timing information for critical infrastructure applications. The demonstration at the NYSE was hosted by Juniper Networks on April 19 and presented to technical representatives from the financial services, energy, and communication sectors. We are constantly working with critical infrastructure partners like the financial sector to help build their capabilities and resilience to a variety of hazards, including space weather and other cyber or physical threats to the system's continuity,'' stated DHS Assistant Secretary for Infrastructure Protection Caitlin Durkovich. Precise and synchronized timing of financial transactions is critical to markets worldwide and is mandated by regulation in the European Union and is increasingly required in the United States. Today, precision timing capabilities are provided primarily by satellite-based Global Positioning System (GPS). However, GPS's space-based signals are low- power and susceptible to possible disruptions. GPS signals are also difficult to receive indoors and in urban canyons. ``During the technology demonstration inside the NYSE building, we were able to not only provide signals indoors but also provide timing information to within 30 nanoseconds of our UTC reference,'' said Sarah Mahmood, S&T program manager for the eLoran cooperation agreement. Recognizing the challenges of space-based signals and the importance of having multiple timing-sources, eLoran is one technology being considered to provide a complementary timing solution to existing GPS technology. ____ [From the Atlantic, June 13, 2016] What Happens If GPS Fails? (By Dan Glass) It only took thirteen millionths of a second to cause a whole lot of problems. Last January, as the U.S. Air Force was taking one satellite in the country's constellation of GPS satellites offline, an incorrect time was accidentally uploaded to several others, making them out of sync by less time than it takes for the sound of a gunshot to leave the chamber. The minute error disrupted GPS-dependent timing equipment around the world for more than 12 hours. While the problem went unnoticed by many people thanks to short-term backup systems, panicked engineers in Europe called equipment makers to help resolve things before global telecommunications networks began to fail. In parts of the U.S and Canada, police, fire, and EMS radio equipment stopped functioning. BBC digital radio was out for two days in many areas, and the anomaly was even detected in electrical power grids. Despite its name, the Global Positioning System is not about maps; it's about time. Each satellite in the constellation (24 are needed, plus the U.S. has several spares) has multiple atomic clocks on board, synchronized with each other and to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)--the time standard used across the world--down to the nanosecond. The satellites continually broadcast their time and position information down to Earth, where GPS receivers in equipment from iPhones to automated tractors acquire signals and use the minuscule differences in their arrival time to determine an exact position. While GPS was initially conceived to aid navigation, globally synchronized time is now a much more critical function of the system. Telecom networks rely on GPS clocks to keep cell towers synchronized so calls can be passed between them. Many electrical power grids use the clocks in equipment that fine-tunes current flow in overloaded networks. The finance sector uses GPS-derived timing systems to timestamp ATM, credit card, and high-speed market transactions. Computer network synchronization, digital television and radio, Doppler radar weather reporting, seismic monitoring, even multi-camera sequencing for film production--GPS clocks have a hand in all. But last January's system failure brings up an often- ignored question: What if all these flying clock radios were wiped out, and everything on the ground started blinking 12:00? According to Mike Lombardi, a metrologist at the National Institute for Standards and Technology, ``Nobody knows exactly what would happen.'' Since so many of these technologies were designed specifically with GPS in mind, the unsettling truth, he says, is ``there's no backup.'' This isn't a secret. Concern for the consequences of the country's reliance on this invisible utility has been growing among industry and government workers for more than 15 years, after the Department of Transportation issued a report on the need for a backup navigation system, in 2001. But while the means to create one has existed since, a winding bureaucratic path has kept it from actually being implemented. And that leaves many of the everyday tools society depends on vulnerable until one is. There are plenty of reasons GPS could fail. Intentional attack is one, as emphasized by a declassified 2012 risk estimate by the Department of Homeland Security. One of the system's most basic problems is its signals are weak enough to be easily obstructed. Truckers with cheap jamming devices designed to elude employer tracking have unintentionally interfered with airport systems; criminals thwarting GPS tags on stolen goods in shipping containers have accidentally shut down port operations. On a grander scale, North Korea has tormented South Korea with waves of jamming attacks. (jamming devices are now illegal in the U.S., but not difficult to obtain illicitly.) A few steps up from jamming devices in both complexity and damage are spoofers: systems that get GPS receivers to lock on to mimicked signal. Spoofers don't trigger equipment alarms, and deliver altered time and position information to unaware users. It's been suggested that Iran used this tactic to lead astray two U.S. Navy patrol boats captured in the Gulf last January. A plausible worst-case attack scenario would look something like this: Spoofers feed erroneous data to electrical substation equipment in a metro area, which could overheat power lines and transformers, causing widespread outages. Meanwhile, multiple hidden jammers could cripple cellphone service, and also force fire, police, and emergency medicine departments to revert to old, single-frequency channels. Supplies in this scenario could only be bought in many places with cash, which would be limited without ATM service. According to the DHS report, it could take 30 days or more before the malicious devices are located and disabled. The longer it took, the more systems that would be compromised. As for unintentional threats to GPS, the DHS risk estimate lists space debris, space weather, defective software, and good old-fashioned human mistakes, among other things. Of these threats, space weather is the most potentially catastrophic, according to Norwegian geophysicist Pal Brekke, whose country was hardest hit by the January outage. Eruptions of high energy radiation from the sun (known as solar flares) and ejections of electrically charged gases have disabled satellites in the past. With satellites and the chips inside them getting smaller as technology progresses, ``one particle from the sun that penetrates a satellite can ruin things,'' Brekke says. ``It wouldn't take that large of an event to take out all GPS.'' So far, mitigating the loss of GPS signals has involved two approaches. One is interoperability with other global navigation satellite systems like Russia's GLONASS (which also failed due to a ground control error in 2014) or the European and Chinese systems, both of which are expected to be up by 2020. The other is better clocks, says Lombardi, the NIST metrologist, who's published numerous articles on the topic. ``The typical cell tower clock has an oscillator similar to that of a wristwatch,'' he says, ``and can drift out of tolerance in minutes without a signal.'' How long a clock can maintain time on its own, called ``holdover,'' also affects electrical grids, many of which rely on GPS-dependent devices called synchrophasors used to precisely regulate current flow, as well as help locate faults in the network. A lack of such timing technology was the reason it took some Canadian technicians three months to locate failures after the infamous blackout of 2003. Chip-scale atomic clocks the size of a penny are a promising new technology that can hold time for about a day, but are currently too expensive to deploy widely. Moreover, hedging and holdover still aren't backups for when space- based signals are simply unavailable. The bulk of a more promising, comprehensive backup system already exists, right here on the ground. After the sextant but before GPS, navigators around the world used Long Range Aids to Navigation, or ``LORAN,'' a terrestrial system of transmitters and receiving equipment first developed during WWII. By the mid-1990s, Loran ``tower chains'' provided coverage for North America, Europe, and other regions in the Northern Hemisphere. Its use declined in favor of the much finer accuracy of GPS after it became available for civil use in 1995, but the U.S. Coast Guard continued working on an improved system using the existing infrastructure. If adopted, ``Enhanced'' LORAN, or eLoran, could provide positioning accuracy comparable to GPS. Broadcast at hundreds of thousands of watts, the signal is virtually un-jammable, and unlike GPS, can even be received indoors, underwater, and in urban or natural canyons. It also turns out that eLoran can provide a UTC time signal with sub-microsecond time resolution across a large geographical area. The technology is available--the Coast Guard demonstrated a working prototype last year--so why isn't America using it? John Garamendi, a California congressman, asked this question at a July 2015 congressional hearing on the Federal Radionavigation Plan, the nation's primary planning document for position, navigation, and timing (PNT). ``There are two kinds of time,'' he opened, ``real time . . . and then federal time, which seems to be the forever time. The e-Loran system was identified as a backup 15 years ago, and here we are, federal time, not yet done.'' Cost doesn't seem to be a problem. A complete alternate PNT system is estimated at $350 million to $400 million; it costs $1 billion yearly to maintain GPS. And science and industry appears to share a consensus that eLoran is the solution. Even the Air Force Colonel and engineer who created GPS, Brad Parkinson, had been on record for years saying ``eLoran is the only cost-effective backup for national needs.'' In a 2004, a presidential directive tasked DHS and DOT with creating a backup to the GPS system. In 2008, the DHS issued a press [[Page H5905]] release that it was committing to the system and transferred control from the Coast Guard to its National Protection and Programs Directorate. But push and pull between DHS and the Coast Guard appears to have slowed progress. After this year's satellite error, many European officials who had previously followed America's reluctance to adopt eLoran stepped up development. Meanwhile, pressure from Garamendi, who argued in his address that ``without an eLoran system in place ASAP, this country is in serious, serious jeopardy,'' prompted a letter to him from the Deputy Secretaries of Defense and Transportation informing that the PNT Executive Committee has agreed that an eLoran-based timing network ``could provide a near term solution'' (if private entities bore some of the cost) while they ``continue [their] efforts to prescribe a complete set of requirements necessary to support a full complementary PNT capability for the nation.'' In other words, it seems: federal time. Why is the sense of urgency among decision-makers so out of sync? Could some of it be similar to why people delay backing up our computers even though they've been telling themselves to for weeks? How do we decide, when presented a risk with unknown odds, when it's time to sacrifice time and resources to prevent it? Now is a critically important time to answer that question, as the world actually been given odds on another, even more catastrophic risk than GPS failure: destruction of the electrical power infrastructure itself. On July 23, 2012, a billion-ton cloud of electrified gases blasted off the far side of the sun at over six million miles per hour. According to professor Daniel Baker at University of Colorado, this coronal mass ejection (CME) ``was in all respects at least as strong as the 1859 Carrington Event,'' referring to the strongest solar storm ever recorded, which set fire to telegraph stations and caused auroras down to Cuba. As was widely reported two years ago, if the 2012 CME had occurred one week later, it would have hit Earth. Space Katrina would be biblically catastrophic. Power could be out for years while electrical transformers were repaired, if the resources are even available to do so. ``Collateral effects of a longer-term outage would likely include disruption of the transportation, communication, banking, and finance systems, and government services; the breakdown of the distribution of potable water owing to pump failure; and the loss of perishable foods and medications because of lack of refrigeration,'' reads a 2008 National Academy of Sciences report. In 2014, physicist from San Diego calculated the likelihood of a Carrington-level event in the next decade. The odds he came up with were 12 percent. The predicament of events like this is not that they're occurring more frequently, but that the rapid development of technology is opening the tools on which humanity depends to an increasingly wide variety of rare but potentially destructive cosmic threats. In the span of a century, we've transferred much of the weight of modern society to global infrastructures with wobbly legs. If they collapse, time will very quickly appear to move backward. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5978, as amended.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter). General Leave Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 5978. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, before we talk about H.R. 5978, I would like to talk about what is not in this bill, which is probably one of the most important things that is my duty, Mr. Garamendi's duty, and the Coast Guard's duty to get done--and that is build a polar icebreaker. Let me tell you why there is no polar icebreaker in this bill: the CBO couldn't get their act together in time to score this one way or another. So, again, this body is held ransom by the Congressional Budget Office not scoring something one way or another, whether it is good to go or not. The reason it is so important that we have more polar icebreakers and that we included the language that passed the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee last week is this: we do not have 24/7, 365- day polar icebreaking ability for the Arctic. The Russians have over 40 polar icebreakers. That is over 40, some of which are even nuclear. China has got more than 20 now. The United States only has one that is capable of crushing heavy ice, and even that is not available 24/7, 365. The High Latitude Region Mission Analysis revealed the following Coast Guard missions--defense readiness; ice operations; marine environmental protection; and ports, waterways, and coastal security in the Arctic--were significantly impacted by the gap in this mission performance. It is these gaps and the knowledge that, when the Polar Star reaches the end of its extended service life, we will have a period where the Coast Guard doesn't have a heavy icebreaker at all, let alone what it has now, which is limited capability in the Arctic. Progress is being made on the acquisition front. Mr. Garamendi and I and the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee granted the Coast Guard the capability to do block buys, which is what the Navy has, where you can purchase more than one vessel at a time, which saves billions of dollars. We also gave them the ability to have lead-time materials, which means they could buy the materials way in advance, which would save tens of millions of dollars. The Coast Guard now has this ability for the FRC and the OPC. We want them to have it for the icebreaker as well, but because of the CBO not scoring this, we weren't able to get the language in. Here is the specific language that is missing from H.R. 5978: ``The Commandant of the Coast Guard, subject to the availability of amounts specifically provided in advance in subsequent appropriations acts may enter into a contract for the acquisition of no less than three heavy polar icebreakers; and may enter into a contract for acquisition of additional polar icebreakers, except that the total number of icebreakers acquired under this subsection may not exceed six.'' We are talking about three. Right now we have one. ``Such acquisitions may be made through block buy contracts; may be incrementally funded; may include combined purchases, also known as economic order quantity purchases, of materials and components; and long lead time materials; and may include advance construction funding.'' This is what the Navy has for every ship that they make. This is one reason we created a joint program office between the Coast Guard and the Navy, so that the Navy can push the Coast Guard to do the right thing. The Coast Guard, let it be said, at the best, has been dragging their feet on acquiring these icebreakers. In fact, they have been pushing back against Congress every inch of the way on this. In my point of view, this is just like UAVs, or the unmanned aerial vehicles that we have now, Predators and the like. Congress earmarked those because the Air Force did not want pilotless airplanes. Then you would have to get rid of pilots. So the Air Force pushed back day and night in the late nineties and this Congress earmarked Predator drones. That is why we have Predator drones. The military pushed back against Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles, also known as MRAP vehicles, which have saved thousands of lives in Iraq and Afghanistan, also pushed by Congress, not the U.S. military. In things like this, Congress is able to see things outside the box, which the Coast Guard cannot in this case. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter) has been an extraordinary leader on trying to address a critical need that the United States has. The Arctic Ocean is opening. There is not only a Northwest Passage, but there is a Northeast Passage. And this year, just a couple of weeks ago--less than 2 weeks ago--a cruise ship passed through the Northwest Passage without the aid of an icebreaker. We absolutely have to have a polar icebreaker. As the chairman said, we have one icebreaker today, and it is going to go in for overhaul. When it does, we have no heavy icebreaker either for the North Pole or the South Pole. We are in trouble. We have to have this. The U.S. Navy has to have it. U.S. security has to have it. And certainly for the commerce in the Arctic, we have to have it. It is a reality. The Arctic Ocean is opening. Commerce will take place. And it will also need military availability in that area. The legislation that is before us today does not have the proper language in it because of CBO sitting on [[Page H5898]] their duff and doodling numbers when we know we need this language. The Senate appropriations bill has a billion dollars for icebreakers, but there is no authorization. Unfortunately, because of our rules here, we had to strip the language out. Later, we hope to put the language back in, but it is not available today. We have to have this. We go back meeting after meeting, hearing after hearing, year after year, 4 or 5 years that we have been working on this, and then, at the very last moment, CBO can't get its act together. Well, I am sorry, CBO. We ought to waive the rules and get on with what we need to do here, which is to provide the authorization. The language that the chairman has worked out with me and others would not only provide the authorization, but would do it in such a way as to give us the very best possible financial deal on the construction of icebreakers--that is a block buy--and also authorizing, should the money be available in the future, an additional three lighter icebreakers beyond the three heavy icebreakers. Not to say we are going to build it all at once, but the authorization is in the law. That then allows the Coast Guard to properly line it up for the very best deal that we can get, maybe one at a time, maybe two or three over a 5- or 10-year period of time. Unfortunately, that language had to be stripped out. So when the chairman started his explanation of this bill, he did so to call all of our attention to what is not in the bill that should have been in the bill, but for CBO and the rules that we have that require us to have CBO's accounting before we move an authorization. That is where we are today. Unfortunately, it is where we are. So we are going to move this bill along. We will probably--hopefully--come back before this session is over in the lameduck session and write this thing properly. Unfortunately, today we are not there. There is more to be said about the rest of the bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, now we are going to get back to H.R. 5978, which is a very good bill in and of itself that, once again, doesn't have the language that we tried to get in. H.R. 5978, the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Amendments Act of 2016, is a catch-all bill that addresses a number of different Coast Guard and maritime transportation issues. The bill involves improvements to the Coast Guard acquisition authorities to ensure the acquisition program keeps in mind the needs of Coast Guard operating units when acquiring assets. This provision also requires an analysis on the use of multiyear procurement and block buy authorities related to the purchase of Fast Response Cutters, Offshore Patrol Cutters, and polar icebreakers, but just a report. We already know from watching the Navy do business for the last few decades that block buys save hundreds of millions of dollars. At the request of the GAO, the bill repeals a GAO report regarding disbursements from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. The information that was collected by GAO will be incorporated into an existing Coast Guard report. Due to certain recent weather events impacting a Coast Guard pier in Wilmington, North Carolina, the Coast Guard is required to issue a one- time report detailing short- and long-term plans to replace and maintain the pier. Certain fishing industries will be assisted by the bill, including those that would be affected by a prescribed Alternative Safety Compliance Program to be issued by the Coast Guard by January 1, 2017. If the service does not issue the program by January 1, 2017, which is hopefully the case, the bill would provide a 3-year window for industry compliance from the date the Coast Guard issues the program. It has been a long-term interest for many, including Ranking Member Garamendi, who has been instrumental--and I would say more instrumental than myself--in preparing the language included in this legislation that there be a reliable land-based positioning, navigation, and timing system to complement, supplement, and back up the Global Positioning System that we now use, the GPS. We have all seen what the Chinese can do now in knocking down satellites. If our GPS goes out, there is no other way for us to navigate the oceans or to navigate land. The eLoran system does this to ensure the continuous availability of uncorrupted or non-degraded signals for military and civilian users. The bill directed the Coast Guard to establish and maintain such a backup system. {time} 1915 Aids to navigation are important tools that allow vessels to safely navigate waterways. The bill would allow the Commandant, subject to appropriations, to reimburse a non-Federal entity for costs incurred by that entity to construct and establish an aid to navigation that would otherwise be constructed by the Coast Guard. Aids to navigation facilitate safe and efficient maritime transportation on federally authorized navigation channels. Specific conditions for reimbursement are outlined. Reimbursements for a single project are limited to $5 million, and the authority expires 4 years after the date of enactment of the bill. There are concerns with the Coast Guard's Western Alaska Captain of the Port Zone approving alternate planning criteria for areas covering only a portion of the zone. This action would create two adjacent areas with different levels of prevention and response preparedness. This bill requires public notice, an economic study, and a report to Congress on the study before approval of any criteria not covering the full Western Alaska zone. Lastly, the bill makes a variety of technical changes to provisions in enacted Coast Guard Authorization Acts. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. (Mr. GARAMENDI asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I join Chairman Hunter in strong support for the legislation and to advance this new policy initiative to improve the oversight of the Coast Guard and the major acquisition programs, and also to advance the safety and security of the U.S. maritime industry. H.R. 5978, the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Amendments Act, is bipartisan legislation. We have talked about some of the provisions that are not in the bill. I will try to talk about those that are in the bill. It deserves the robust support from Members on both sides of the aisle, and I urge its quick passage, probably as early as today. I thank the gentleman, Mr. Hunter, for his unwavering support of the Coast Guard and the work that we are able to do together with the members of the committee. Of great significance, this legislation will address an overlooked and underappreciated threat to our national and economic security: the fact that GPS, Global Positioning System, it has been identified for nearly 20 years as the single point of failure, with serious implications for our national security and economy. I know we are not able to use these little machines called cell phones on the floor, but if we could, they are totally reliant on GPS. You go down to the ATM, it will not work without GPS. Our systems of navigation, including such things as positive train control, totally dependent upon GPS. In fact, Wall Street, totally dependent on GPS. It is timing, navigation, and positioning. That is GPS. We have no backup; other countries do. You might ask, why is China, why is Russia, why are they building a GLAN-based backup to GPS? Well, they know that if there is trouble, the first thing that is going to disappear is GPS. Right now, GPS can be knocked out by somebody driving down the freeway with their 18-wheeler and using an antiradar device. You might ask what happened at the Newark airport. That is exactly what happened. GPS was knocked out by somebody on Interstate 95 with a radar device. It is a very weak signal, but it is an extraordinarily important signal. So this bill provides for a backup system which has been discussed for nearly 20 [[Page H5899]] years, and we have gone round and round the Bush--I guess that is the right thing--and the Clinton, in between, without any action. So this bill would actually push this forward to give us an opportunity to establish a backup system, which is actually very old but will be updated with the enhanced LORAN system, dating back to the 1940s, which was the first navigational system that we built in the United States. Much of the system is already available; the towers, the locations, much of that is in place. This would authorize a public-private partnership to put that in place. I won't go into it anymore, but it is high time that we get on with this. The chairman laid out how it is going to be done in his talk and, hopefully, we can finally get this underway. There are many, many other pieces that are in this legislation. We have talked a little bit about the Coast Guard icebreakers. We do have a study--oh, my goodness, another study. It is the best we could do at the moment. The chairman and I talked about what we would like to accomplish with more than that with his actual authorization. The block buy, we have got to do it, and, hopefully, we will. There are other things that are in the bill that the chairman has described. I won't go into them today in any more detail but to say that, in my written statement, it will be covered. One more thing, to back up the GPS, I include in the Record about 15 years of studies by Federal Government agencies that all say we have got to have a backup system, and the eLORAN is the best. Mr. Chairman, shall we continue on and beat this for a while longer or shall we say let's pass the bill and get on with it? I am pleased to rise and join Chairman Hunter in strong support of this legislation to advance new policy initiatives to improve the oversight of the Coast Guard's major acquisition programs and to advance the safety and security of the U.S. maritime industry. H.R. 5978, the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Amendments Act of 2016, is bipartisan legislation that was developed to address issues that have arisen since the Congress passed a two-year comprehensive Coast Guard authorization bill earlier this year. This legislation is deserving of robust support from members on both sides of the aisle and I urge its quick passage by the House today so it can be sent to the other body for its consideration and passage before the 114th Congress adjourns sine die. I want to thank Chairman Hunter for his unwavering leadership and for the cooperative spirit of this excellent staff in working with me and other Democratic members to address our interests and concerns in this legislation. Of greatest significance, this legislation will address an overlooked need and under-appreciated threat to our national and economic security--the fact that the Global Positioning System, or GPS, has been identified as a single point of failure with serious implications for our national security and economy. GPS has revolutionized how we live, work, and play. Signals provided by GPS satellites ensure that literally everything that we routinely depend on not only runs, but runs with unprecedented reliability and precision. We have all benefitted from GPS: whether through the distribution of power from our electric grid; the coordination of timing signals for trains and traffic signals; or, to improve the efficiency of maritime search and rescue missions launched by the Coast Guard. There is no denying that GPS has been a tremendous technological asset. But the reality is that GPS signals are relatively weak and fairly easy to degrade, disrupt or jam. This is not a hypothetical matter; this threat is real, and it is happening now. Just last week, the Commandant of the Coast Guard, Admiral Paul Zukunft, while speaking at a National Harbor Safety Conference in Portland, Oregon, cited over 100 instances in which vessels experienced disruption to their GPS reception. There is nothing we can do to change the underlying physics of the GPS signal. We can, however, take necessary and appropriate actions now to ensure that a reliable land-based back-up system for positioning, navigation and timing signals is available when needed. Moreover, if the Russians, the Chinese, the EU, and other nations are developing land-based GPS back-up systems, the United States should have its own system as well. Since 2001 the Federal Government, notably the PNT Executive Committee, has been evaluating options. The Executive Committee concluded in December, 2014 that an enhanced LORAN, or eLORAN system, would be the most cost-effective and reliable back-up for GPS signals. What this legislation will do is force the Federal Government to finally take action on its own recommendation. The Coast Guard, which for decades operated the LORAN-C navigation system (the predecessor of GPS), would be directed to publish a request for proposals, complete a plan for the architecture of an eLORAN system, and get a system built and fully operational within three years. Make no mistake, this is a significant undertaking. But the stakes of doing nothing is a risky roll of the dice we would be well-advised to avoid. I strongly urge members on both sides to support this important provision. I am also very pleased that this legislation continues to move forward in our efforts to recapitalize the Coast Guard's legacy fleet of polar class heavy icebreakers. It is clear that we are witnessing the opening of the Arctic to maritime commerce, and with it, the creation of a whole new ocean of operational responsibility for the Coast Guard. In this most challenging of maritime environments, it is vital that the Service has the icebreaking capabilities it will need to operate safely and effectively. I must express my disappointment that we were unable to retain the ``block buy'' provision that was reported out of the Transportation Committee. Nevertheless, the analysis of multi-year procurement and block buy contracting called for in this legislation would be helpful to have on hand when the Congress ultimately does appropriate funds for the construction of these vital new national security assets. I also want to express my support for other provisions in the bill, notably language that will ensure commercial fishermen a full three years to comply with new alternative safety compliance program requirements from the date the Coast Guard publishes these requirements. Additionally, I want to express my support for the provision that would grant to the Coast Guard authority to reimburse private entities for their costs to construct a Federal navigation aid. The additional sideboards that were added have clarified the scope and intent of this new authority. I want to thank Congressman Blake Farenthold for his willingness to work to improve this provision. Mr. Speaker, I again want to express my appreciation to Chairman Hunter and his staff for their support for the Coast Guard and the U.S. Maritime industry, and for their collaboration in developing this legislation. I also want to thank the Chairman of the full Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Congressman Bill Shuster, and the Ranking Member on the full Committee, Congressman Peter DeFazio, for their leadership and support for the Committee's maritime agenda. In closing, this legislation is bipartisan and non-controversial. It deserves the full support of the House. NSPD-39: U.S. Space-Based Position, Navigation, and Timing Policy, December 15, 2004 FACT SHEET The President authorized a new national policy on December 8, 2004 that establishes guidance and implementation actions for space-based positioning, navigation, and timing programs, augmentations, and activities for U.S. national and homeland security, civil, scientific, and commercial purposes. This policy supersedes Presidential Decision Directive/National Science and Technology Council-6, U.S. Global Positioning System Policy, dated March 28, 1996. I. Scope and Definitions This policy provides guidance for: (1) development, acquisition, operation, sustainment, and modernization of the Global Positioning System and U.S.-developed, owned and/or operated systems used to augment or otherwise improve the Global Positioning System and/or other space-based positioning, navigation, and timing signals; (2) development, deployment, sustainment, and modernization of capabilities to protect U.S. and allied access to and use of the Global Positioning System for national, homeland, and economic security, and to deny adversaries access to any space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services; and (3) foreign access to the Global Positioning System and United States Government augmentations, and international cooperation with foreign space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services, including augmentations. For purposes of this document: ``Interoperable'' refers to the ability of civil U.S. and foreign space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services to be used together to provide better capabilities at the user level than would be achieved by relying solely on one service or signal; ``Compatible'' refers to the ability of U.S. and foreign space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services to be used separately or together without interfering with each individual service or signal, and without adversely affecting navigation warfare; and ``Augmentation'' refers to space and/or ground-based systems that provide users of space-based positioning, navigation, and timing signals with additional information [[Page H5900]] that enables users to obtain enhanced performance when compared to the un-augmented space-based signals alone. These improvements include better accuracy, availability, integrity, and reliability, with independent integrity monitoring and alerting capabilities for critical applications. II. Background Over the past decade, the Global Positioning System has grown into a global utility whose multiuse services are integral to U.S. national security, economic growth, transportation safety, and homeland security, and are an essential element of the worldwide economic infrastructure. In the year 2000, the United States recognized the increasing importance of the Global Positioning System to civil and commercial users by discontinuing the deliberate degradation of accuracy for non-military signals, known as Selective Availability. Since that time, commercial and civil applications of the Global Positioning System have continued to multiply and their importance has increased significantly. Services dependent on Global Positioning System information are now an engine for economic growth, enhancing economic development, and improving safety of life, and the system is a key component of multiple sectors of U.S. critical infrastructure. While the growth in civil and commercial applications continues, the positioning, navigation, and timing information provided by the Global Positioning System remains critical to U.S. national security, and its applications are integrated into virtually every facet of U.S. military operations. United States and allied military forces will continue to rely on the Global Positioning System military services for positioning, navigation, and timing services. The continuing growth of services based on the Global Positioning System presents opportunities, risks, and threats to U.S. national, homeland, and economic security. The widespread and growing dependence on the Global Positioning System of military, civil, and commercial systems and infrastructures has made many of these systems inherently vulnerable to an unexpected interruption in positioning, navigation, and/or timing services. In addition, whether designed for military capabilities or not, all positioning, navigation, and timing signals from space and their augmentations provide inherent capabilities that can be used by adversaries, including enemy military forces and terrorist groups. Finally, emerging foreign space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services could enhance or undermine the future utility of the Global Positioning System. The United States must continue to improve and maintain the Global Positioning System, augmentations, and backup capabilities to meet growing national, homeland, and economic security requirements, for civil requirements, and to meet commercial and scientific demands. In parallel, we must continue to improve capabilities to deny adversary access to all space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services, particularly including services that are openly available and can be readily used by adversaries and/or terrorists to threaten the security of the United States. In addition, the diverse requirements for and multiple applications of space- based positioning, navigation, and timing services require stable yet adaptable policies and management mechanisms. The existing management mechanisms for the Global Positioning System and its augmentations must be modified to accommodate a multi-use approach to program planning, resource allocation, system development, and operations. Therefore, the United States Government must improve the policy and management framework governing the Global Positioning System and its augmentations to support their continued ability to meet increasing and varied domestic and global requirements. III. Goals and Objectives The fundamental goal of this policy is to ensure that the United States maintains space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services, augmentation, back-up, and service denial capabilities that: (1) provide uninterrupted availability of positioning, navigation, and timing services; (2) meet growing national, homeland, economic security, and civil requirements, and scientific and commercial demands; (3) remain the pre-eminent military space-based positioning, navigation, and timing service; (4) continue to provide civil services that exceed or are competitive with foreign civil space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services and augmentation systems; (5) remain essential components of internationally accepted positioning, navigation, and timing services; and (6) promote U.S. technological leadership in applications involving space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services. To achieve this goal, the United States Government shall: Provide uninterrupted access to U.S. space-based global, precise positioning, navigation, and timing services for U.S. and allied national security systems and capabilities through the Global Positioning System, without being dependent on foreign positioning, navigation, and timing services; Provide on a continuous, worldwide basis civil space-based, positioning, navigation, and timing services free of direct user fees for civil, commercial, and scientific uses, and for homeland security through the Global Positioning System and its augmentations, and provide open, free access to information necessary to develop and build equipment to use these services; Improve capabilities to deny hostile use of any space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services, without unduly disrupting civil and commercial access to civil positioning, navigation, and timing services outside an area of military operations, or for homeland security purposes; Improve the performance of space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services, including more robust resistance to interference for, and consistent with, U.S. and allied national security purposes, homeland security, and civil, commercial, and scientific users worldwide; Maintain the Global Positioning System as a component of multiple sectors of the U.S. Critical Infrastructure, consistent with Homeland Security Presidential Directive-7, Critical Infrastructure Identification, Prioritization, and Protection, dated December 17, 2003; Encourage foreign development of positioning, navigation, and timing services and systems based on the Global Positioning System. Seek to ensure that foreign space-based positioning, navigation, and timing systems are interoperable with the civil services of the Global Positioning System and its augmentations in order to benefit civil, commercial, and scientific users worldwide. At a minimum, seek to ensure that foreign systems are compatible with the Global Positioning System and its augmentations and address mutual security concerns with foreign providers to prevent hostile use of space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services; and Promote the use of U.S. space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services and capabilities for applications at the Federal, State, and local level, to the maximum practical extent. IV. Management of Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Services This policy establishes a permanent National Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Executive Committee. The Executive Committee will be co-chaired by the Deputy Secretaries of the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation or by their designated representatives. Its members will include representatives at the equivalent level from the Departments of State, Commerce, and Homeland Security, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and from other Departments and Agencies as required. Components of the Executive Office of the President, including the Office of Management and Budget, the National Security Council staff, the Homeland Security Council staff, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the National Economic Council staff, shall participate as observers to the Executive Committee. The Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission shall be invited to participate on the Executive Committee as a Liaison. The Executive Committee shall meet at least twice each year. The Secretaries of Defense and Transportation shall develop the procedures by which the Committee shall operate.

Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Farenthold). Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill. There are a lot of good things in it for the Nation. As a former computer technician, I know there is nothing worse than a single point of failure in the network. GPS is a single point of failure for a lot of things; eLORAN is absolutely must-have. We can talk about what is not in the bill as well, but I do want to talk about a section that is specifically important to the district I represent. Section 202 grants the authority for the Coast Guard to reimburse non-Federal entities for the cost of construction to certain aids to navigation. This authority ensures these types of safety-related navigation projects can move forward in a timely fashion. We are all too aware of how slow the government can be, especially when it comes to funding projects, so we have come up with a way here where we can work with non-Federal partners to improve the safety of our navigation system. It doesn't cost the government anything. The non-Federal partners go ahead and put in the equipment up to Coast Guard standards with Coast Guard approval and get it done now; and then, when the Coast Guard gets the money, when the red tape and government machine moves through its procedure, they can get reimbursed, while our mariners can enjoin the enhanced safety and our ports can enjoy [[Page H5903]] the enhanced economic activity as a result of being able to, for instance, traverse channels in low-light conditions. It is safety. It is good for the economy. In fact, one of the problems that brought this to my attention was when there was a project in Corpus Christi, the La Quinta Channel. Somehow, the aids to navigation never got built, even though this channel has been dredged and is in use. The pilots say it is unsafe to use in low-light conditions, and it looks like it could be years before the Coast Guard gets around to funding it. Well, the Port of Corpus Christi is willing to pony up the money today. The Coast Guard says: All right; when we get it, we will give it back. This piece of legislation allows that to happen. It is good government, along with lots of other pieces of this legislation, something we need to pass, and I urge my colleagues to git-r-done. Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. We need polar icebreakers. This body is going to push; Mr. Garamendi and I are going to push and push until we have polar icebreakers and we have at least \1/140\ the capability of Russia. That is a pretty low bar that we are setting for ourselves, but we are going to set it right here, right now, in this body. Let's at least have \1/140\ of the capability or Russia, build those polar icebreakers. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support H.R. 5978. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following materials: Exelis, UrsaNav, the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Coast Guard Enter Agreement to Trial Ground-Based Position, Navigation and Timing Signal Herndon, VA, May 22, 2015.--Exelis (NYSE: XLS), UrsaNav, Inc., the Department of Homeland Security's Science and Technology Directorate (DHS S&T), and the U.S. Coast Guard have entered into a cooperative research and development agreement (CRADA) for testing and demonstration at former LORAN-C sites. These sites are the legacy ground-based radio navigation infrastructure of the decommissioned LORAN-C service that could be retained and upgraded to provide eLORAN low frequency service. The team will evaluate eLORAN as a potential complementary system to the current Global Positioning System (GPS) currently in wide use throughout the United States. The capabilities and potential utilization methods of eLORAN will be explored in depth to identify all strengths, capacities, and potential vulnerabilities of the technology. Under the CRADA, Exelis will use the former LORAN-C assets to put eLORAN signals in space for research, test and demonstration of the ability of eLORAN to meet precise positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) requirements of government and privately-owned critical infrastructure. The first station Exelis will broadcast from is located in Wildwood, NJ. The broadcast will provide a usable signal at a range up to 1000 miles. ``eLORAN is an ideal technology to complement GPS for critical, resilient and assured PNT,'' said Ed Sayadian, vice president of Civil & Aerospace Systems for Exelis. ``eLORAN is a difficult to disrupt technology that offers PNT and wide area broadcast data capabilities indoors, in underground locations and other GPS-denied environments.'' ``A preponderance of government, academic, and industry reports have concluded that eLORAN is the best independent, multi-modal solution to provide assured PNT as a complement to GPS,'' said Chuck Schue, president and CEO of UrsaNay. Exelis and UrsaNav have entered into this CRADA because they believe that low frequency signals, such as eLORAN, operate independently of GPS signals and can provide alternative timing, either standalone, or as a component of a PNT service. Exelis also believes that as a result of its wealth of experience in its PNT portfolio, that there are many civil and defense applications that require precise time and/or position in GPS-denied environments. Examples include radio frequency interference, both intentional and unintentional; signal attenuation from heavy forest canopy, terrain or buildings; and indoor and underground locations. About UsaNav: UrsaNav, Inc. is a Veteran-Owned and Service- Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business focused on delivering innovative engineering and information solutions, and associated professional services to government and commercial clients worldwide.

Dear Congressman DeFazio: Thank you for your August 31, 2015, letter regarding the importance of the Global Positioning System (GPS) and the need for a complementary positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) capability for the nation. We share your concerns regarding the importance of GPS to our critical infrastructure and security requirements. Seeking to implement the guidance from National Security Presidential Directive 39, the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Transportation established an interagency process in 2014 to assess those information sources that are complementary to GPS and that could be used to ensure the continuity of PNT services to critical infrastructure. Through this interagency process, the National Space-Based PNT Executive Committee (EXCOM) reviewed several potential solutions and assessed that an enhanced Loran (eLoran) network could be a viable nationwide complementary capability for GPS applications in U.S. critical infrastructure. The EXCOM also assessed that a timing-focused network could be implemented in the near term with properly scoped specifications, costs, and cost sharing arrangements. As you stated, there may be opportunities to work with private and commercial entities to initiate these complementary capabilities. The EXCOM met on September 3, 2015, and agreed to a two- fold strategy for activities to explore a national complementary capability to GPS: pursue potential near-term opportunities to leverage public and private sector capabilities and resources to support a timing-focused eLoran network, while also documenting the requirements for a more comprehensive complementary PNT capability for the nation's critical infrastructure. The EXCOM acknowledges the challenges associated with this undertaking, especially given the fact that no government- wide set of requirements has been established for such a complementary capability. However, sufficient data exists from previous studies to produce initial cost estimates and basic system specifications to determine the appropriate scope of the effort. We are building on these data and estimates to develop a more detailed approach for an initial timing-focused eLoran capability. This initial timing network could provide a near-term solution while we continue our efforts to prescribe a complete set of requirements necessary to support a full complementary PNT capability for the nation. We look forward to working with you as we continue our efforts to provide a complementary PNT capability for U.S. critical infrastructure. We have sent a similar response to each cosigner of your letter. Sincerely, Victor M. Mendez, Deputy Secretary of Transportation, Co-Chair, National Executive Committee for Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing. Robert O. Work, Deputy Secretary of Defense, Co-Chair, National Executive Committee for Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing. ____ [From the DHS Science & Technology Press Office, Apr. 20, 2016] DHS S&T Demonstrates Precision Timing Technology at the New York Stock Exchange Washington.--The Department of Homeland security, Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) announced today the successful demonstration of the Enhanced Loren (eLoran), a precision-timing technology for financial transactions at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). eLoran is a low-frequency, high-power radio navigation signal that is broadcasted by ground-based transmission stations, allowing the signal to penetrate through buildings and provide precision timing indoors and throughout urban environments. ``Accurate position, navigation, and timing is necessary for the function and integrity of many critical infrastructure sectors, such as the electric grid, communication networks, and financial institutions,'' said DHS Under Secretary for Science and Technology Dr. Reginald Brothers. ``Ensuring the continuous and uninterrupted availability of critical information ensures our national security.'' [[Page H5904]] DHS S&T, U.S. Coast Guard, UrsaNav, Inc., and Harris Corporation study eLoran through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement for applicability to provide timing information for critical infrastructure applications. The demonstration at the NYSE was hosted by Juniper Networks on April 19 and presented to technical representatives from the financial services, energy, and communication sectors. We are constantly working with critical infrastructure partners like the financial sector to help build their capabilities and resilience to a variety of hazards, including space weather and other cyber or physical threats to the system's continuity,'' stated DHS Assistant Secretary for Infrastructure Protection Caitlin Durkovich. Precise and synchronized timing of financial transactions is critical to markets worldwide and is mandated by regulation in the European Union and is increasingly required in the United States. Today, precision timing capabilities are provided primarily by satellite-based Global Positioning System (GPS). However, GPS's space-based signals are low- power and susceptible to possible disruptions. GPS signals are also difficult to receive indoors and in urban canyons. ``During the technology demonstration inside the NYSE building, we were able to not only provide signals indoors but also provide timing information to within 30 nanoseconds of our UTC reference,'' said Sarah Mahmood, S&T program manager for the eLoran cooperation agreement. Recognizing the challenges of space-based signals and the importance of having multiple timing-sources, eLoran is one technology being considered to provide a complementary timing solution to existing GPS technology. ____ [From the Atlantic, June 13, 2016] What Happens If GPS Fails? (By Dan Glass) It only took thirteen millionths of a second to cause a whole lot of problems. Last January, as the U.S. Air Force was taking one satellite in the country's constellation of GPS satellites offline, an incorrect time was accidentally uploaded to several others, making them out of sync by less time than it takes for the sound of a gunshot to leave the chamber. The minute error disrupted GPS-dependent timing equipment around the world for more than 12 hours. While the problem went unnoticed by many people thanks to short-term backup systems, panicked engineers in Europe called equipment makers to help resolve things before global telecommunications networks began to fail. In parts of the U.S and Canada, police, fire, and EMS radio equipment stopped functioning. BBC digital radio was out for two days in many areas, and the anomaly was even detected in electrical power grids. Despite its name, the Global Positioning System is not about maps; it's about time. Each satellite in the constellation (24 are needed, plus the U.S. has several spares) has multiple atomic clocks on board, synchronized with each other and to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)--the time standard used across the world--down to the nanosecond. The satellites continually broadcast their time and position information down to Earth, where GPS receivers in equipment from iPhones to automated tractors acquire signals and use the minuscule differences in their arrival time to determine an exact position. While GPS was initially conceived to aid navigation, globally synchronized time is now a much more critical function of the system. Telecom networks rely on GPS clocks to keep cell towers synchronized so calls can be passed between them. Many electrical power grids use the clocks in equipment that fine-tunes current flow in overloaded networks. The finance sector uses GPS-derived timing systems to timestamp ATM, credit card, and high-speed market transactions. Computer network synchronization, digital television and radio, Doppler radar weather reporting, seismic monitoring, even multi-camera sequencing for film production--GPS clocks have a hand in all. But last January's system failure brings up an often- ignored question: What if all these flying clock radios were wiped out, and everything on the ground started blinking 12:00? According to Mike Lombardi, a metrologist at the National Institute for Standards and Technology, ``Nobody knows exactly what would happen.'' Since so many of these technologies were designed specifically with GPS in mind, the unsettling truth, he says, is ``there's no backup.'' This isn't a secret. Concern for the consequences of the country's reliance on this invisible utility has been growing among industry and government workers for more than 15 years, after the Department of Transportation issued a report on the need for a backup navigation system, in 2001. But while the means to create one has existed since, a winding bureaucratic path has kept it from actually being implemented. And that leaves many of the everyday tools society depends on vulnerable until one is. There are plenty of reasons GPS could fail. Intentional attack is one, as emphasized by a declassified 2012 risk estimate by the Department of Homeland Security. One of the system's most basic problems is its signals are weak enough to be easily obstructed. Truckers with cheap jamming devices designed to elude employer tracking have unintentionally interfered with airport systems; criminals thwarting GPS tags on stolen goods in shipping containers have accidentally shut down port operations. On a grander scale, North Korea has tormented South Korea with waves of jamming attacks. (jamming devices are now illegal in the U.S., but not difficult to obtain illicitly.) A few steps up from jamming devices in both complexity and damage are spoofers: systems that get GPS receivers to lock on to mimicked signal. Spoofers don't trigger equipment alarms, and deliver altered time and position information to unaware users. It's been suggested that Iran used this tactic to lead astray two U.S. Navy patrol boats captured in the Gulf last January. A plausible worst-case attack scenario would look something like this: Spoofers feed erroneous data to electrical substation equipment in a metro area, which could overheat power lines and transformers, causing widespread outages. Meanwhile, multiple hidden jammers could cripple cellphone service, and also force fire, police, and emergency medicine departments to revert to old, single-frequency channels. Supplies in this scenario could only be bought in many places with cash, which would be limited without ATM service. According to the DHS report, it could take 30 days or more before the malicious devices are located and disabled. The longer it took, the more systems that would be compromised. As for unintentional threats to GPS, the DHS risk estimate lists space debris, space weather, defective software, and good old-fashioned human mistakes, among other things. Of these threats, space weather is the most potentially catastrophic, according to Norwegian geophysicist Pal Brekke, whose country was hardest hit by the January outage. Eruptions of high energy radiation from the sun (known as solar flares) and ejections of electrically charged gases have disabled satellites in the past. With satellites and the chips inside them getting smaller as technology progresses, ``one particle from the sun that penetrates a satellite can ruin things,'' Brekke says. ``It wouldn't take that large of an event to take out all GPS.'' So far, mitigating the loss of GPS signals has involved two approaches. One is interoperability with other global navigation satellite systems like Russia's GLONASS (which also failed due to a ground control error in 2014) or the European and Chinese systems, both of which are expected to be up by 2020. The other is better clocks, says Lombardi, the NIST metrologist, who's published numerous articles on the topic. ``The typical cell tower clock has an oscillator similar to that of a wristwatch,'' he says, ``and can drift out of tolerance in minutes without a signal.'' How long a clock can maintain time on its own, called ``holdover,'' also affects electrical grids, many of which rely on GPS-dependent devices called synchrophasors used to precisely regulate current flow, as well as help locate faults in the network. A lack of such timing technology was the reason it took some Canadian technicians three months to locate failures after the infamous blackout of 2003. Chip-scale atomic clocks the size of a penny are a promising new technology that can hold time for about a day, but are currently too expensive to deploy widely. Moreover, hedging and holdover still aren't backups for when space- based signals are simply unavailable. The bulk of a more promising, comprehensive backup system already exists, right here on the ground. After the sextant but before GPS, navigators around the world used Long Range Aids to Navigation, or ``LORAN,'' a terrestrial system of transmitters and receiving equipment first developed during WWII. By the mid-1990s, Loran ``tower chains'' provided coverage for North America, Europe, and other regions in the Northern Hemisphere. Its use declined in favor of the much finer accuracy of GPS after it became available for civil use in 1995, but the U.S. Coast Guard continued working on an improved system using the existing infrastructure. If adopted, ``Enhanced'' LORAN, or eLoran, could provide positioning accuracy comparable to GPS. Broadcast at hundreds of thousands of watts, the signal is virtually un-jammable, and unlike GPS, can even be received indoors, underwater, and in urban or natural canyons. It also turns out that eLoran can provide a UTC time signal with sub-microsecond time resolution across a large geographical area. The technology is available--the Coast Guard demonstrated a working prototype last year--so why isn't America using it? John Garamendi, a California congressman, asked this question at a July 2015 congressional hearing on the Federal Radionavigation Plan, the nation's primary planning document for position, navigation, and timing (PNT). ``There are two kinds of time,'' he opened, ``real time . . . and then federal time, which seems to be the forever time. The e-Loran system was identified as a backup 15 years ago, and here we are, federal time, not yet done.'' Cost doesn't seem to be a problem. A complete alternate PNT system is estimated at $350 million to $400 million; it costs $1 billion yearly to maintain GPS. And science and industry appears to share a consensus that eLoran is the solution. Even the Air Force Colonel and engineer who created GPS, Brad Parkinson, had been on record for years saying ``eLoran is the only cost-effective backup for national needs.'' In a 2004, a presidential directive tasked DHS and DOT with creating a backup to the GPS system. In 2008, the DHS issued a press [[Page H5905]] release that it was committing to the system and transferred control from the Coast Guard to its National Protection and Programs Directorate. But push and pull between DHS and the Coast Guard appears to have slowed progress. After this year's satellite error, many European officials who had previously followed America's reluctance to adopt eLoran stepped up development. Meanwhile, pressure from Garamendi, who argued in his address that ``without an eLoran system in place ASAP, this country is in serious, serious jeopardy,'' prompted a letter to him from the Deputy Secretaries of Defense and Transportation informing that the PNT Executive Committee has agreed that an eLoran-based timing network ``could provide a near term solution'' (if private entities bore some of the cost) while they ``continue [their] efforts to prescribe a complete set of requirements necessary to support a full complementary PNT capability for the nation.'' In other words, it seems: federal time. Why is the sense of urgency among decision-makers so out of sync? Could some of it be similar to why people delay backing up our computers even though they've been telling themselves to for weeks? How do we decide, when presented a risk with unknown odds, when it's time to sacrifice time and resources to prevent it? Now is a critically important time to answer that question, as the world actually been given odds on another, even more catastrophic risk than GPS failure: destruction of the electrical power infrastructure itself. On July 23, 2012, a billion-ton cloud of electrified gases blasted off the far side of the sun at over six million miles per hour. According to professor Daniel Baker at University of Colorado, this coronal mass ejection (CME) ``was in all respects at least as strong as the 1859 Carrington Event,'' referring to the strongest solar storm ever recorded, which set fire to telegraph stations and caused auroras down to Cuba. As was widely reported two years ago, if the 2012 CME had occurred one week later, it would have hit Earth. Space Katrina would be biblically catastrophic. Power could be out for years while electrical transformers were repaired, if the resources are even available to do so. ``Collateral effects of a longer-term outage would likely include disruption of the transportation, communication, banking, and finance systems, and government services; the breakdown of the distribution of potable water owing to pump failure; and the loss of perishable foods and medications because of lack of refrigeration,'' reads a 2008 National Academy of Sciences report. In 2014, physicist from San Diego calculated the likelihood of a Carrington-level event in the next decade. The odds he came up with were 12 percent. The predicament of events like this is not that they're occurring more frequently, but that the rapid development of technology is opening the tools on which humanity depends to an increasingly wide variety of rare but potentially destructive cosmic threats. In the span of a century, we've transferred much of the weight of modern society to global infrastructures with wobbly legs. If they collapse, time will very quickly appear to move backward. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5978, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_204.csv,106058,106058,106130,"[congressional record volume 162, number 145 (monday, september 26, 2016)] [house] [pages h5894-h5905] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] coast guard and maritime transportation amendments act of 2016 mr. hunter. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 5978) to amend title 14, united states code, to clarify the functions of the chief acquisition officer of the coast guard, and for other purposes, as amended. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 5978 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title; table of contents.

speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on h.r. 5978. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from california? there was no objection. mr. hunter. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, before we talk about h.r. 5978, i would like to talk about what is not in this bill, which is probably one of the most important things that is my duty, mr. garamendi's duty, and the coast guard's duty to get done--and that is build a polar icebreaker. let me tell you why there is no polar icebreaker in this bill: the cbo couldn't get their act together in time to score this one way or another. so, again, this body is held ransom by the congressional budget office not scoring something one way or another, whether it is good to go or not. the reason it is so important that we have more polar icebreakers and that we included the language that passed the transportation and infrastructure committee last week is this: we do not have 24/7, 365- day polar icebreaking ability for the arctic. the russians have over 40 polar icebreakers. that is over 40, some of which are even nuclear. china has got more than 20 now. the united states only has one that is capable of crushing heavy ice, and even that is not available 24/7, 365. the high latitude region mission analysis revealed the following coast guard missions--defense readiness; ice operations; marine environmental protection; and ports, waterways, and coastal security in the arctic--were significantly impacted by the gap in this mission performance. it is these gaps and the knowledge that, when the polar star reaches the end of its extended service life, we will have a period where the coast guard doesn't have a heavy icebreaker at all, let alone what it has now, which is limited capability in the arctic. progress is being made on the acquisition front. mr. garamendi and i and the transportation and infrastructure committee granted the coast guard the capability to do block buys, which is what the navy has, where you can purchase more than one vessel at a time, which saves billions of dollars. we also gave them the ability to have lead-time materials, which means they could buy the materials way in advance, which would save tens of millions of dollars. the coast guard now has this ability for the frc and the opc. we want them to have it for the icebreaker as well, but because of the cbo not scoring this, we weren't able to get the language in. here is the specific language that is missing from h.r. 5978: ``the commandant of the coast guard, subject to the availability of amounts specifically provided in advance in subsequent appropriations acts may enter into a contract for the acquisition of no less than three heavy polar icebreakers; and may enter into a contract for acquisition of additional polar icebreakers, except that the total number of icebreakers acquired under this subsection may not exceed six.'' we are talking about three. right now we have one. ``such acquisitions may be made through block buy contracts; may be incrementally funded; may include combined purchases, also known as economic order quantity purchases, of materials and components; and long lead time materials; and may include advance construction funding.'' this is what the navy has for every ship that they make. this is one reason we created a joint program office between the coast guard and the navy, so that the navy can push the coast guard to do the right thing. the coast guard, let it be said, at the best, has been dragging their feet on acquiring these icebreakers. in fact, they have been pushing back against congress every inch of the way on this. in my point of view, this is just like uavs, or the unmanned aerial vehicles that we have now, predators and the like. congress earmarked those because the air force did not want pilotless airplanes. then you would have to get rid of pilots. so the air force pushed back day and night in the late nineties and this congress earmarked predator drones. that is why we have predator drones. the military pushed back against mine-resistant ambush protected vehicles, also known as mrap vehicles, which have saved thousands of lives in iraq and afghanistan, also pushed by congress, not the u.s. military. in things like this, congress is able to see things outside the box, which the coast guard cannot in this case. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. garamendi. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, the gentleman from california (mr. hunter) has been an extraordinary leader on trying to address a critical need that the united states has. the arctic ocean is opening. there is not only a northwest passage, but there is a northeast passage. and this year, just a couple of weeks ago--less than 2 weeks ago--a cruise ship passed through the northwest passage without the aid of an icebreaker. we absolutely have to have a polar icebreaker. as the chairman said, we have one icebreaker today, and it is going to go in for overhaul. when it does, we have no heavy icebreaker either for the north pole or the south pole. we are in trouble. we have to have this. the u.s. navy has to have it. u.s. security has to have it. and certainly for the commerce in the arctic, we have to have it. it is a reality. the arctic ocean is opening. commerce will take place. and it will also need military availability in that area. the legislation that is before us today does not have the proper language in it because of cbo sitting on [[page h5898]] their duff and doodling numbers when we know we need this language. the senate appropriations bill has a billion dollars for icebreakers, but there is no authorization. unfortunately, because of our rules here, we had to strip the language out. later, we hope to put the language back in, but it is not available today. we have to have this. we go back meeting after meeting, hearing after hearing, year after year, 4 or 5 years that we have been working on this, and then, at the very last moment, cbo can't get its act together. well, i am sorry, cbo. we ought to waive the rules and get on with what we need to do here, which is to provide the authorization. the language that the chairman has worked out with me and others would not only provide the authorization, but would do it in such a way as to give us the very best possible financial deal on the construction of icebreakers--that is a block buy--and also authorizing, should the money be available in the future, an additional three lighter icebreakers beyond the three heavy icebreakers. not to say we are going to build it all at once, but the authorization is in the law. that then allows the coast guard to properly line it up for the very best deal that we can get, maybe one at a time, maybe two or three over a 5- or 10-year period of time. unfortunately, that language had to be stripped out. so when the chairman started his explanation of this bill, he did so to call all of our attention to what is not in the bill that should have been in the bill, but for cbo and the rules that we have that require us to have cbo's accounting before we move an authorization. that is where we are today. unfortunately, it is where we are. so we are going to move this bill along. we will probably--hopefully--come back before this session is over in the lameduck session and write this thing properly. unfortunately, today we are not there. there is more to be said about the rest of the bill. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. hunter. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, now we are going to get back to h.r. 5978, which is a very good bill in and of itself that, once again, doesn't have the language that we tried to get in. h.r. 5978, the coast guard and maritime transportation amendments act of 2016, is a catch-all bill that addresses a number of different coast guard and maritime transportation issues. the bill involves improvements to the coast guard acquisition authorities to ensure the acquisition program keeps in mind the needs of coast guard operating units when acquiring assets. this provision also requires an analysis on the use of multiyear procurement and block buy authorities related to the purchase of fast response cutters, offshore patrol cutters, and polar icebreakers, but just a report. we already know from watching the navy do business for the last few decades that block buys save hundreds of millions of dollars. at the request of the gao, the bill repeals a gao report regarding disbursements from the oil spill liability trust fund. the information that was collected by gao will be incorporated into an existing coast guard report. due to certain recent weather events impacting a coast guard pier in wilmington, north carolina, the coast guard is required to issue a one- time report detailing short- and long-term plans to replace and maintain the pier. certain fishing industries will be assisted by the bill, including those that would be affected by a prescribed alternative safety compliance program to be issued by the coast guard by january 1, 2017. if the service does not issue the program by january 1, 2017, which is hopefully the case, the bill would provide a 3-year window for industry compliance from the date the coast guard issues the program. it has been a long-term interest for many, including ranking member garamendi, who has been instrumental--and i would say more instrumental than myself--in preparing the language included in this legislation that there be a reliable land-based positioning, navigation, and timing system to complement, supplement, and back up the global positioning system that we now use, the gps. we have all seen what the chinese can do now in knocking down satellites. if our gps goes out, there is no other way for us to navigate the oceans or to navigate land. the eloran system does this to ensure the continuous availability of uncorrupted or non-degraded signals for military and civilian users. the bill directed the coast guard to establish and maintain such a backup system. {time} 1915 aids to navigation are important tools that allow vessels to safely navigate waterways. the bill would allow the commandant, subject to appropriations, to reimburse a non-federal entity for costs incurred by that entity to construct and establish an aid to navigation that would otherwise be constructed by the coast guard. aids to navigation facilitate safe and efficient maritime transportation on federally authorized navigation channels. specific conditions for reimbursement are outlined. reimbursements for a single project are limited to $5 million, and the authority expires 4 years after the date of enactment of the bill. there are concerns with the coast guard's western alaska captain of the port zone approving alternate planning criteria for areas covering only a portion of the zone. this action would create two adjacent areas with different levels of prevention and response preparedness. this bill requires public notice, an economic study, and a report to congress on the study before approval of any criteria not covering the full western alaska zone. lastly, the bill makes a variety of technical changes to provisions in enacted coast guard authorization acts. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. garamendi. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. (mr. garamendi asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) mr. garamendi. mr. speaker, i join chairman hunter in strong support for the legislation and to advance this new policy initiative to improve the oversight of the coast guard and the major acquisition programs, and also to advance the safety and security of the u.s. maritime industry. h.r. 5978, the coast guard and maritime transportation amendments act, is bipartisan legislation. we have talked about some of the provisions that are not in the bill. i will try to talk about those that are in the bill. it deserves the robust support from members on both sides of the aisle, and i urge its quick passage, probably as early as today. i thank the gentleman, mr. hunter, for his unwavering support of the coast guard and the work that we are able to do together with the members of the committee. of great significance, this legislation will address an overlooked and underappreciated threat to our national and economic security: the fact that gps, global positioning system, it has been identified for nearly 20 years as the single point of failure, with serious implications for our national security and economy. i know we are not able to use these little machines called cell phones on the floor, but if we could, they are totally reliant on gps. you go down to the atm, it will not work without gps. our systems of navigation, including such things as positive train control, totally dependent upon gps. in fact, wall street, totally dependent on gps. it is timing, navigation, and positioning. that is gps. we have no backup; other countries do. you might ask, why is china, why is russia, why are they building a glan-based backup to gps? well, they know that if there is trouble, the first thing that is going to disappear is gps. right now, gps can be knocked out by somebody driving down the freeway with their 18-wheeler and using an antiradar device. you might ask what happened at the newark airport. that is exactly what happened. gps was knocked out by somebody on interstate 95 with a radar device. it is a very weak signal, but it is an extraordinarily important signal. so this bill provides for a backup system which has been discussed for nearly 20 [[page h5899]] years, and we have gone round and round the bush--i guess that is the right thing--and the clinton, in between, without any action. so this bill would actually push this forward to give us an opportunity to establish a backup system, which is actually very old but will be updated with the enhanced loran system, dating back to the 1940s, which was the first navigational system that we built in the united states. much of the system is already available; the towers, the locations, much of that is in place. this would authorize a public-private partnership to put that in place. i won't go into it anymore, but it is high time that we get on with this. the chairman laid out how it is going to be done in his talk and, hopefully, we can finally get this underway. there are many, many other pieces that are in this legislation. we have talked a little bit about the coast guard icebreakers. we do have a study--oh, my goodness, another study. it is the best we could do at the moment. the chairman and i talked about what we would like to accomplish with more than that with his actual authorization. the block buy, we have got to do it, and, hopefully, we will. there are other things that are in the bill that the chairman has described. i won't go into them today in any more detail but to say that, in my written statement, it will be covered. one more thing, to back up the gps, i include in the record about 15 years of studies by federal government agencies that all say we have got to have a backup system, and the eloran is the best. mr. chairman, shall we continue on and beat this for a while longer or shall we say let's pass the bill and get on with it? i am pleased to rise and join chairman hunter in strong support of this legislation to advance new policy initiatives to improve the oversight of the coast guard's major acquisition programs and to advance the safety and security of the u.s. maritime industry. h.r. 5978, the coast guard and maritime transportation amendments act of 2016, is bipartisan legislation that was developed to address issues that have arisen since the congress passed a two-year comprehensive coast guard authorization bill earlier this year. this legislation is deserving of robust support from members on both sides of the aisle and i urge its quick passage by the house today so it can be sent to the other body for its consideration and passage before the 114th congress adjourns sine die. i want to thank chairman hunter for his unwavering leadership and for the cooperative spirit of this excellent staff in working with me and other democratic members to address our interests and concerns in this legislation. of greatest significance, this legislation will address an overlooked need and under-appreciated threat to our national and economic security--the fact that the global positioning system, or gps, has been identified as a single point of failure with serious implications for our national security and economy. gps has revolutionized how we live, work, and play. signals provided by gps satellites ensure that literally everything that we routinely depend on not only runs, but runs with unprecedented reliability and precision. we have all benefitted from gps: whether through the distribution of power from our electric grid; the coordination of timing signals for trains and traffic signals; or, to improve the efficiency of maritime search and rescue missions launched by the coast guard. there is no denying that gps has been a tremendous technological asset. but the reality is that gps signals are relatively weak and fairly easy to degrade, disrupt or jam. this is not a hypothetical matter; this threat is real, and it is happening now. just last week, the commandant of the coast guard, admiral paul zukunft, while speaking at a national harbor safety conference in portland, oregon, cited over 100 instances in which vessels experienced disruption to their gps reception. there is nothing we can do to change the underlying physics of the gps signal. we can, however, take necessary and appropriate actions now to ensure that a reliable land-based back-up system for positioning, navigation and timing signals is available when needed. moreover, if the russians, the chinese, the eu, and other nations are developing land-based gps back-up systems, the united states should have its own system as well. since 2001 the federal government, notably the pnt executive committee, has been evaluating options. the executive committee concluded in december, 2014 that an enhanced loran, or eloran system, would be the most cost-effective and reliable back-up for gps signals. what this legislation will do is force the federal government to finally take action on its own recommendation. the coast guard, which for decades operated the loran-c navigation system (the predecessor of gps), would be directed to publish a request for proposals, complete a plan for the architecture of an eloran system, and get a system built and fully operational within three years. make no mistake, this is a significant undertaking. but the stakes of doing nothing is a risky roll of the dice we would be well-advised to avoid. i strongly urge members on both sides to support this important provision. i am also very pleased that this legislation continues to move forward in our efforts to recapitalize the coast guard's legacy fleet of polar class heavy icebreakers. it is clear that we are witnessing the opening of the arctic to maritime commerce, and with it, the creation of a whole new ocean of operational responsibility for the coast guard. in this most challenging of maritime environments, it is vital that the service has the icebreaking capabilities it will need to operate safely and effectively. i must express my disappointment that we were unable to retain the ``block buy'' provision that was reported out of the transportation committee. nevertheless, the analysis of multi-year procurement and block buy contracting called for in this legislation would be helpful to have on hand when the congress ultimately does appropriate funds for the construction of these vital new national security assets. i also want to express my support for other provisions in the bill, notably language that will ensure commercial fishermen a full three years to comply with new alternative safety compliance program requirements from the date the coast guard publishes these requirements. additionally, i want to express my support for the provision that would grant to the coast guard authority to reimburse private entities for their costs to construct a federal navigation aid. the additional sideboards that were added have clarified the scope and intent of this new authority. i want to thank congressman blake farenthold for his willingness to work to improve this provision. mr. speaker, i again want to express my appreciation to chairman hunter and his staff for their support for the coast guard and the u.s. maritime industry, and for their collaboration in developing this legislation. i also want to thank the chairman of the full transportation and infrastructure committee, congressman bill shuster, and the ranking member on the full committee, congressman peter defazio, for their leadership and support for the committee's maritime agenda. in closing, this legislation is bipartisan and non-controversial. it deserves the full support of the house. nspd-39: u.s. space-based position, navigation, and timing policy, december 15, 2004 fact sheet the president authorized a new national policy on december 8, 2004 that establishes guidance and implementation actions for space-based positioning, navigation, and timing programs, augmentations, and activities for u.s. national and homeland security, civil, scientific, and commercial purposes. this policy supersedes presidential decision directive/national science and technology council-6, u.s. global positioning system policy, dated march 28, 1996. i. scope and definitions this policy provides guidance for: (1) development, acquisition, operation, sustainment, and modernization of the global positioning system and u.s.-developed, owned and/or operated systems used to augment or otherwise improve the global positioning system and/or other space-based positioning, navigation, and timing signals; (2) development, deployment, sustainment, and modernization of capabilities to protect u.s. and allied access to and use of the global positioning system for national, homeland, and economic security, and to deny adversaries access to any space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services; and (3) foreign access to the global positioning system and united states government augmentations, and international cooperation with foreign space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services, including augmentations. for purposes of this document: ``interoperable'' refers to the ability of civil u.s. and foreign space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services to be used together to provide better capabilities at the user level than would be achieved by relying solely on one service or signal; ``compatible'' refers to the ability of u.s. and foreign space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services to be used separately or together without interfering with each individual service or signal, and without adversely affecting navigation warfare; and ``augmentation'' refers to space and/or ground-based systems that provide users of space-based positioning, navigation, and timing signals with additional information [[page h5900]] that enables users to obtain enhanced performance when compared to the un-augmented space-based signals alone. these improvements include better accuracy, availability, integrity, and reliability, with independent integrity monitoring and alerting capabilities for critical applications. ii. background over the past decade, the global positioning system has grown into a global utility whose multiuse services are integral to u.s. national security, economic growth, transportation safety, and homeland security, and are an essential element of the worldwide economic infrastructure. in the year 2000, the united states recognized the increasing importance of the global positioning system to civil and commercial users by discontinuing the deliberate degradation of accuracy for non-military signals, known as selective availability. since that time, commercial and civil applications of the global positioning system have continued to multiply and their importance has increased significantly. services dependent on global positioning system information are now an engine for economic growth, enhancing economic development, and improving safety of life, and the system is a key component of multiple sectors of u.s. critical infrastructure. while the growth in civil and commercial applications continues, the positioning, navigation, and timing information provided by the global positioning system remains critical to u.s. national security, and its applications are integrated into virtually every facet of u.s. military operations. united states and allied military forces will continue to rely on the global positioning system military services for positioning, navigation, and timing services. the continuing growth of services based on the global positioning system presents opportunities, risks, and threats to u.s. national, homeland, and economic security. the widespread and growing dependence on the global positioning system of military, civil, and commercial systems and infrastructures has made many of these systems inherently vulnerable to an unexpected interruption in positioning, navigation, and/or timing services. in addition, whether designed for military capabilities or not, all positioning, navigation, and timing signals from space and their augmentations provide inherent capabilities that can be used by adversaries, including enemy military forces and terrorist groups. finally, emerging foreign space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services could enhance or undermine the future utility of the global positioning system. the united states must continue to improve and maintain the global positioning system, augmentations, and backup capabilities to meet growing national, homeland, and economic security requirements, for civil requirements, and to meet commercial and scientific demands. in parallel, we must continue to improve capabilities to deny adversary access to all space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services, particularly including services that are openly available and can be readily used by adversaries and/or terrorists to threaten the security of the united states. in addition, the diverse requirements for and multiple applications of space- based positioning, navigation, and timing services require stable yet adaptable policies and management mechanisms. the existing management mechanisms for the global positioning system and its augmentations must be modified to accommodate a multi-use approach to program planning, resource allocation, system development, and operations. therefore, the united states government must improve the policy and management framework governing the global positioning system and its augmentations to support their continued ability to meet increasing and varied domestic and global requirements. iii. goals and objectives the fundamental goal of this policy is to ensure that the united states maintains space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services, augmentation, back-up, and service denial capabilities that: (1) provide uninterrupted availability of positioning, navigation, and timing services; (2) meet growing national, homeland, economic security, and civil requirements, and scientific and commercial demands; (3) remain the pre-eminent military space-based positioning, navigation, and timing service; (4) continue to provide civil services that exceed or are competitive with foreign civil space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services and augmentation systems; (5) remain essential components of internationally accepted positioning, navigation, and timing services; and (6) promote u.s. technological leadership in applications involving space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services. to achieve this goal, the united states government shall: provide uninterrupted access to u.s. space-based global, precise positioning, navigation, and timing services for u.s. and allied national security systems and capabilities through the global positioning system, without being dependent on foreign positioning, navigation, and timing services; provide on a continuous, worldwide basis civil space-based, positioning, navigation, and timing services free of direct user fees for civil, commercial, and scientific uses, and for homeland security through the global positioning system and its augmentations, and provide open, free access to information necessary to develop and build equipment to use these services; improve capabilities to deny hostile use of any space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services, without unduly disrupting civil and commercial access to civil positioning, navigation, and timing services outside an area of military operations, or for homeland security purposes; improve the performance of space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services, including more robust resistance to interference for, and consistent with, u.s. and allied national security purposes, homeland security, and civil, commercial, and scientific users worldwide; maintain the global positioning system as a component of multiple sectors of the u.s. critical infrastructure, consistent with homeland security presidential directive-7, critical infrastructure identification, prioritization, and protection, dated december 17, 2003; encourage foreign development of positioning, navigation, and timing services and systems based on the global positioning system. seek to ensure that foreign space-based positioning, navigation, and timing systems are interoperable with the civil services of the global positioning system and its augmentations in order to benefit civil, commercial, and scientific users worldwide. at a minimum, seek to ensure that foreign systems are compatible with the global positioning system and its augmentations and address mutual security concerns with foreign providers to prevent hostile use of space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services; and promote the use of u.s. space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services and capabilities for applications at the federal, state, and local level, to the maximum practical extent. iv. management of space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services this policy establishes a permanent national space-based positioning, navigation, and timing executive committee. the executive committee will be co-chaired by the deputy secretaries of the department of defense and the department of transportation or by their designated representatives. its members will include representatives at the equivalent level from the departments of state, commerce, and homeland security, the joint chiefs of staff, the national aeronautics and space administration, and from other departments and agencies as required. components of the executive office of the president, including the office of management and budget, the national security council staff, the homeland security council staff, the office of science and technology policy, and the national economic council staff, shall participate as observers to the executive committee. the chairman of the federal communications commission shall be invited to participate on the executive committee as a liaison. the executive committee shall meet at least twice each year. the secretaries of defense and transportation shall develop the procedures by which the committee shall operate. the executive committee shall make recommendations to its member departments and agencies, and to the president through the representatives of the executive office of the president. in addition, the executive committee will advise and coordinate with and among the departments and agencies responsible for the strategic decisions regarding policies, architectures, requirements, and resource allocation for maintaining and improving u.s. space-based positioning, navigation, and timing infrastructures, including the global positioning system, its augmentations, security for these services, and relationships with foreign positioning, navigation, and timing services. specifically, the executive committee shall: ensure that national security, homeland security, and civil requirements receive full and appropriate consideration in the decision-making process and facilitate the integration and de-confliction of these requirements for space-based positioning, navigation, and timing capabilities, as required; coordinate individual departments' and agencies' positioning, navigation, and timing program plans, requirements, budgets, and policies, and assess the adequacy of funding and schedules to meet validated requirements in a timely manner; ensure that the utility of civil services exceeds, or is at least equivalent to, those routinely provided by foreign space-based positioning, navigation, and timing services; promote plans to modernize the u.s. space-based positioning, navigation, and timing infrastructure, including: (1) development, deployment, and operation of new and/or improved national security and public safety services when required and to the maximum practical extent; and (2) determining the apportionment of requirements between the global positioning system and its augmentations, including consideration of user equipment; review proposals and provide recommendations to the departments and agencies for international cooperation, as well as spectrum management and protection issues; and establish a space-based positioning, navigation, and timing advisory board. the board shall be comprised of experts from outside the united states government, and shall be chartered as a federal advisory committee. the executive committee shall establish the national space- based positioning, navigation, and timing coordination office. this [[page h5901]] office shall provide the staff functions for the executive committee. it shall be led by a full-time director chosen by, and reporting to the executive committee, and shall include a cadre of full-time staff provided by departments and agencies represented on the executive committee. the executive committee shall determine the resources for the national space-based positioning, navigation, and timing coordination office, including funding, location, staffing, and composition, consistent with the direction of this policy. the national space-based positioning, navigation, and timing coordination office shall serve as the secretariat for the executive committee and shall perform those functions delegated by the executive committee. departments and agencies shall provide appropriate information to the national space-based positioning, navigation, and timing coordination office to ensure interagency transparency about positioning, navigation, and timing programs, policies, budgets, and activities that might affect mutual interests or interagency dependencies. the interagency global positioning system executive board is hereby disestablished, and the executive committee or the national space-based positioning, navigation, and timing coordination office, as appropriate, shall assume its functions as defined in the positioning, navigation, and timing executive committee charter, consistent with the direction provided in this policy. the executive committee shall advise and coordinate the interdepartmental resource allocation for the global positioning system and it augmentations on an annual basis. the secretary of defense shall have primary responsibility for providing resources for development, acquisition, operation, sustainment, and modernization of the global positioning system. the secretary of transportation shall provide resources to the secretary of defense for assessment, development, acquisition, implementation, operation, and sustainment of additional designated global positioning system civil capabilities beyond the second and third civil signals already contained in the current global positioning system program global positioning system civil signal performance monitoring, augmentations, and other unique positioning, navigation, and timing capabilities will be funded by the agency or agencies requiring those services or capabilities, including out-year procurement and operations costs. any new technical features proposed and funded by the civil agencies shall not degrade or displace existing or planned national security functions of the system. if the executive committee recommends that the availability of global positioning system capabilities should be accelerated, the executive committee will make recommendations regarding the resources required to accelerate those capabilities. resource issues will be resolved during the regular budget process. the details of the cost sharing between: (1) the department of defense and the department of transportation, for the global positioning system; and (2) departments and agencies sponsoring augmentations, and/or unique or accelerated capabilities, shall be outlined in a five-year national space-based positioning, navigation, and timing plan, consistent with the guidance provided in this policy. v. foreign access to u.s. space-based positioning, navigation, and timing capabilities any exports of u.s. positioning, navigation, and timing capabilities covered by the united states munitions list or the commerce control list will continue to be licensed pursuant to the international traffic in arms regulations or the export administration regulations, as appropriate, and in accordance with all existing laws and regulations. as a general guideline, export of civil or other non-united states munitions list space-based positioning, navigation and timing capabilities that are currently available or are planned to be available in the global marketplace will continue to be considered favorably. exports of sensitive or advanced positioning, navigation, and timing information, systems, technologies, and components will be considered on a case-by-case basis in accordance with existing laws and regulations, as well as relevant national security and foreign policy goals and considerations. in support of such reviews, the secretary of state, in consultation with the secretaries of defense, commerce, and energy, the administrator of the national aeronautics and space administration, and the director of central intelligence, shall modify and maintain the sensitive technology list directed in u.s. commercial remote sensing space policy, dated april 25, 2003, including those technology items or areas deemed sensitive for positioning, navigation and timing applications. the secretaries of state and commerce shall use the list in the evaluation of requests for exports. vi. agency roles and responsibilities departments and agencies shall allocate the resources required to fulfill the objectives of this policy. nothing in this policy shall diminish the operational and budgetary authorities of the departments and agencies. the secretary of defense shall: have responsibility for development, acquisition, operation, security, and continued modernization of the global positioning system, while facilitating appropriate civil and homeland security department and agency representation and participation in these activities, and any decisions that affect civil and homeland security equities;

eloran is absolutely must-have. we can talk about what is not in the bill as well, but i do want to talk about a section that is specifically important to the district i represent. section 202 grants the authority for the coast guard to reimburse non-federal entities for the cost of construction to certain aids to navigation. this authority ensures these types of safety-related navigation projects can move forward in a timely fashion. we are all too aware of how slow the government can be, especially when it comes to funding projects, so we have come up with a way here where we can work with non-federal partners to improve the safety of our navigation system. it doesn't cost the government anything. the non-federal partners go ahead and put in the equipment up to coast guard standards with coast guard approval and get it done now; and then, when the coast guard gets the money, when the red tape and government machine moves through its procedure, they can get reimbursed, while our mariners can enjoin the enhanced safety and our ports can enjoy [[page h5903]] the enhanced economic activity as a result of being able to, for instance, traverse channels in low-light conditions. it is safety. it is good for the economy. in fact, one of the problems that brought this to my attention was when there was a project in corpus christi, the la quinta channel. somehow, the aids to navigation never got built, even though this channel has been dredged and is in use. the pilots say it is unsafe to use in low-light conditions, and it looks like it could be years before the coast guard gets around to funding it. well, the port of corpus christi is willing to pony up the money today. the coast guard says: all right; when we get it, we will give it back. this piece of legislation allows that to happen. it is good government, along with lots of other pieces of this legislation, something we need to pass, and i urge my colleagues to git-r-done. mr. hunter. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. we need polar icebreakers. this body is going to push; mr. garamendi and i are going to push and push until we have polar icebreakers and we have at least \1/140\ the capability of russia. that is a pretty low bar that we are setting for ourselves, but we are going to set it right here, right now, in this body. let's at least have \1/140\ of the capability or russia, build those polar icebreakers. mr. speaker, i urge all members to support h.r. 5978. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. garamendi. mr. speaker, i include in the record the following materials: exelis, ursanav, the department of homeland security and the u.s. coast guard enter agreement to trial ground-based position, navigation and timing signal herndon, va, may 22, 2015.--exelis (nyse: xls), ursanav, inc., the department of homeland security's science and technology directorate (dhs s&t), and the u.s. coast guard have entered into a cooperative research and development agreement (crada) for testing and demonstration at former loran-c sites. these sites are the legacy ground-based radio navigation infrastructure of the decommissioned loran-c service that could be retained and upgraded to provide eloran low frequency service. the team will evaluate eloran as a potential complementary system to the current global positioning system (gps) currently in wide use throughout the united states. the capabilities and potential utilization methods of eloran will be explored in depth to identify all strengths, capacities, and potential vulnerabilities of the technology. under the crada, exelis will use the former loran-c assets to put eloran signals in space for research, test and demonstration of the ability of eloran to meet precise positioning, navigation and timing (pnt) requirements of government and privately-owned critical infrastructure. the first station exelis will broadcast from is located in wildwood, nj. the broadcast will provide a usable signal at a range up to 1000 miles. ``eloran is an ideal technology to complement gps for critical, resilient and assured pnt,'' said ed sayadian, vice president of civil & aerospace systems for exelis. ``eloran is a difficult to disrupt technology that offers pnt and wide area broadcast data capabilities indoors, in underground locations and other gps-denied environments.'' ``a preponderance of government, academic, and industry reports have concluded that eloran is the best independent, multi-modal solution to provide assured pnt as a complement to gps,'' said chuck schue, president and ceo of ursanay. exelis and ursanav have entered into this crada because they believe that low frequency signals, such as eloran, operate independently of gps signals and can provide alternative timing, either standalone, or as a component of a pnt service. exelis also believes that as a result of its wealth of experience in its pnt portfolio, that there are many civil and defense applications that require precise time and/or position in gps-denied environments. examples include radio frequency interference, both intentional and unintentional; signal attenuation from heavy forest canopy, terrain or buildings; and indoor and underground locations. about usanav: ursanav, inc. is a veteran-owned and service- disabled veteran-owned small business focused on delivering innovative engineering and information solutions, and associated professional services to government and commercial clients worldwide. ursanav is the world's leading supplier of eloran technology, equipment, and services with deep experience in the design, development, and deployment of pnt systems. for more information, visit our website at www.ursanay.com. about exelis: exelis is a diversified, top-tier global aerospace, defense, information and services company that leverages a greater than 50-year legacy of deep customer knowledge and technical expertise to deliver affordable, mission-critical solutions for global customers. exelis is a leader in positioning and navigation, sensors, air traffic management solutions, image processing and distribution, communications and information systems;

[[page h5904]] dhs s&t, u.s. coast guard, ursanav, inc., and harris corporation study eloran through a cooperative research and development agreement for applicability to provide timing information for critical infrastructure applications. the demonstration at the nyse was hosted by juniper networks on april 19 and presented to technical representatives from the financial services, energy, and communication sectors. we are constantly working with critical infrastructure partners like the financial sector to help build their capabilities and resilience to a variety of hazards, including space weather and other cyber or physical threats to the system's continuity,'' stated dhs assistant secretary for infrastructure protection caitlin durkovich. precise and synchronized timing of financial transactions is critical to markets worldwide and is mandated by regulation in the european union and is increasingly required in the united states. today, precision timing capabilities are provided primarily by satellite-based global positioning system (gps). however, gps's space-based signals are low- power and susceptible to possible disruptions. gps signals are also difficult to receive indoors and in urban canyons. ``during the technology demonstration inside the nyse building, we were able to not only provide signals indoors but also provide timing information to within 30 nanoseconds of our utc reference,'' said sarah mahmood, s&t program manager for the eloran cooperation agreement. recognizing the challenges of space-based signals and the importance of having multiple timing-sources, eloran is one technology being considered to provide a complementary timing solution to existing gps technology. ____ [from the atlantic, june 13, 2016] what happens if gps fails? (by dan glass) it only took thirteen millionths of a second to cause a whole lot of problems. last january, as the u.s. air force was taking one satellite in the country's constellation of gps satellites offline, an incorrect time was accidentally uploaded to several others, making them out of sync by less time than it takes for the sound of a gunshot to leave the chamber. the minute error disrupted gps-dependent timing equipment around the world for more than 12 hours. while the problem went unnoticed by many people thanks to short-term backup systems, panicked engineers in europe called equipment makers to help resolve things before global telecommunications networks began to fail. in parts of the u.s and canada, police, fire, and ems radio equipment stopped functioning. bbc digital radio was out for two days in many areas, and the anomaly was even detected in electrical power grids. despite its name, the global positioning system is not about maps; it's about time. each satellite in the constellation (24 are needed, plus the u.s. has several spares) has multiple atomic clocks on board, synchronized with each other and to coordinated universal time (utc)--the time standard used across the world--down to the nanosecond. the satellites continually broadcast their time and position information down to earth, where gps receivers in equipment from iphones to automated tractors acquire signals and use the minuscule differences in their arrival time to determine an exact position. while gps was initially conceived to aid navigation, globally synchronized time is now a much more critical function of the system. telecom networks rely on gps clocks to keep cell towers synchronized so calls can be passed between them. many electrical power grids use the clocks in equipment that fine-tunes current flow in overloaded networks. the finance sector uses gps-derived timing systems to timestamp atm, credit card, and high-speed market transactions. computer network synchronization, digital television and radio, doppler radar weather reporting, seismic monitoring, even multi-camera sequencing for film production--gps clocks have a hand in all. but last january's system failure brings up an often- ignored question: what if all these flying clock radios were wiped out, and everything on the ground started blinking 12:00? according to mike lombardi, a metrologist at the national institute for standards and technology, ``nobody knows exactly what would happen.'' since so many of these technologies were designed specifically with gps in mind, the unsettling truth, he says, is ``there's no backup.'' this isn't a secret. concern for the consequences of the country's reliance on this invisible utility has been growing among industry and government workers for more than 15 years, after the department of transportation issued a report on the need for a backup navigation system, in 2001. but while the means to create one has existed since, a winding bureaucratic path has kept it from actually being implemented. and that leaves many of the everyday tools society depends on vulnerable until one is. there are plenty of reasons gps could fail. intentional attack is one, as emphasized by a declassified 2012 risk estimate by the department of homeland security. one of the system's most basic problems is its signals are weak enough to be easily obstructed. truckers with cheap jamming devices designed to elude employer tracking have unintentionally interfered with airport systems; criminals thwarting gps tags on stolen goods in shipping containers have accidentally shut down port operations. on a grander scale, north korea has tormented south korea with waves of jamming attacks. (jamming devices are now illegal in the u.s., but not difficult to obtain illicitly.) a few steps up from jamming devices in both complexity and damage are spoofers: systems that get gps receivers to lock on to mimicked signal. spoofers don't trigger equipment alarms, and deliver altered time and position information to unaware users. it's been suggested that iran used this tactic to lead astray two u.s. navy patrol boats captured in the gulf last january. a plausible worst-case attack scenario would look something like this: spoofers feed erroneous data to electrical substation equipment in a metro area, which could overheat power lines and transformers, causing widespread outages. meanwhile, multiple hidden jammers could cripple cellphone service, and also force fire, police, and emergency medicine departments to revert to old, single-frequency channels. supplies in this scenario could only be bought in many places with cash, which would be limited without atm service. according to the dhs report, it could take 30 days or more before the malicious devices are located and disabled. the longer it took, the more systems that would be compromised. as for unintentional threats to gps, the dhs risk estimate lists space debris, space weather, defective software, and good old-fashioned human mistakes, among other things. of these threats, space weather is the most potentially catastrophic, according to norwegian geophysicist pal brekke, whose country was hardest hit by the january outage. eruptions of high energy radiation from the sun (known as solar flares) and ejections of electrically charged gases have disabled satellites in the past. with satellites and the chips inside them getting smaller as technology progresses, ``one particle from the sun that penetrates a satellite can ruin things,'' brekke says. ``it wouldn't take that large of an event to take out all gps.'' so far, mitigating the loss of gps signals has involved two approaches. one is interoperability with other global navigation satellite systems like russia's glonass (which also failed due to a ground control error in 2014) or the european and chinese systems, both of which are expected to be up by 2020. the other is better clocks, says lombardi, the nist metrologist, who's published numerous articles on the topic. ``the typical cell tower clock has an oscillator similar to that of a wristwatch,'' he says, ``and can drift out of tolerance in minutes without a signal.'' how long a clock can maintain time on its own, called ``holdover,'' also affects electrical grids, many of which rely on gps-dependent devices called synchrophasors used to precisely regulate current flow, as well as help locate faults in the network. a lack of such timing technology was the reason it took some canadian technicians three months to locate failures after the infamous blackout of 2003. chip-scale atomic clocks the size of a penny are a promising new technology that can hold time for about a day, but are currently too expensive to deploy widely. moreover, hedging and holdover still aren't backups for when space- based signals are simply unavailable. the bulk of a more promising, comprehensive backup system already exists, right here on the ground. after the sextant but before gps, navigators around the world used long range aids to navigation, or ``loran,'' a terrestrial system of transmitters and receiving equipment first developed during wwii. by the mid-1990s, loran ``tower chains'' provided coverage for north america, europe, and other regions in the northern hemisphere. its use declined in favor of the much finer accuracy of gps after it became available for civil use in 1995, but the u.s. coast guard continued working on an improved system using the existing infrastructure. if adopted, ``enhanced'' loran, or eloran, could provide positioning accuracy comparable to gps. broadcast at hundreds of thousands of watts, the signal is virtually un-jammable, and unlike gps, can even be received indoors, underwater, and in urban or natural canyons. it also turns out that eloran can provide a utc time signal with sub-microsecond time resolution across a large geographical area. the technology is available--the coast guard demonstrated a working prototype last year--so why isn't america using it? john garamendi, a california congressman, asked this question at a july 2015 congressional hearing on the federal radionavigation plan, the nation's primary planning document for position, navigation, and timing (pnt). ``there are two kinds of time,'' he opened, ``real time . . . and then federal time, which seems to be the forever time. the e-loran system was identified as a backup 15 years ago, and here we are, federal time, not yet done.'' cost doesn't seem to be a problem. a complete alternate pnt system is estimated at $350 million to $400 million; it costs $1 billion yearly to maintain gps. and science and industry appears to share a consensus that eloran is the solution. even the air force colonel and engineer who created gps, brad parkinson, had been on record for years saying ``eloran is the only cost-effective backup for national needs.'' in a 2004, a presidential directive tasked dhs and dot with creating a backup to the gps system. in 2008, the dhs issued a press [[page h5905]] release that it was committing to the system and transferred control from the coast guard to its national protection and programs directorate. but push and pull between dhs and the coast guard appears to have slowed progress. after this year's satellite error, many european officials who had previously followed america's reluctance to adopt eloran stepped up development. meanwhile, pressure from garamendi, who argued in his address that ``without an eloran system in place asap, this country is in serious, serious jeopardy,'' prompted a letter to him from the deputy secretaries of defense and transportation informing that the pnt executive committee has agreed that an eloran-based timing network ``could provide a near term solution'' (if private entities bore some of the cost) while they ``continue [their] efforts to prescribe a complete set of requirements necessary to support a full complementary pnt capability for the nation.'' in other words, it seems: federal time. why is the sense of urgency among decision-makers so out of sync? could some of it be similar to why people delay backing up our computers even though they've been telling themselves to for weeks? how do we decide, when presented a risk with unknown odds, when it's time to sacrifice time and resources to prevent it? now is a critically important time to answer that question, as the world actually been given odds on another, even more catastrophic risk than gps failure: destruction of the electrical power infrastructure itself. on july 23, 2012, a billion-ton cloud of electrified gases blasted off the far side of the sun at over six million miles per hour. according to professor daniel baker at university of colorado, this coronal mass ejection (cme) ``was in all respects at least as strong as the 1859 carrington event,'' referring to the strongest solar storm ever recorded, which set fire to telegraph stations and caused auroras down to cuba. as was widely reported two years ago, if the 2012 cme had occurred one week later, it would have hit earth. space katrina would be biblically catastrophic. power could be out for years while electrical transformers were repaired, if the resources are even available to do so. ``collateral effects of a longer-term outage would likely include disruption of the transportation, communication, banking, and finance systems, and government services; the breakdown of the distribution of potable water owing to pump failure; and the loss of perishable foods and medications because of lack of refrigeration,'' reads a 2008 national academy of sciences report. in 2014, physicist from san diego calculated the likelihood of a carrington-level event in the next decade. the odds he came up with were 12 percent. the predicament of events like this is not that they're occurring more frequently, but that the rapid development of technology is opening the tools on which humanity depends to an increasingly wide variety of rare but potentially destructive cosmic threats. in the span of a century, we've transferred much of the weight of modern society to global infrastructures with wobbly legs. if they collapse, time will very quickly appear to move backward. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from california (mr. hunter) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 5978, as amended. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",106058

Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, as a proud Jayhawk, I rise today to recognize a great leader for the State of Kansas who has made a positive impact on the lives of many fellow Kansans--KU Chancellor Bernadette Gray- Little. Last week, Chancellor Gray-Little announced her retirement in 2017, and I wanted to recognize some of the major accomplishments during her tenure at KU. From day one, she set aggressive goals through her Bold Aspirations initiative to advance the university into the 21st century as a leader in education and research. It was a great success, leading to KU being designated as a National Cancer Institute and working towards a Comprehensive Cancer Center designation. The KU Alzheimer's Disease Center also received national designation from the National Institute on Aging.

CREC-2016-09-26-pt1-PgH5907-4,CREC-2016-09-26,114,AMERICA HAS NOT FORGOTTEN YOU,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [House] [Pages H5907-H5911] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 1945 AMERICA HAS NOT FORGOTTEN YOU The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, a friend of mine works part time in a hardware store. He is retired from several other careers, but he continues to enjoy helping people in a retail-service environment. Recently, he kindly gave me, as we were talking about gardening, some hosta plants that he had grown. As I drove through his neighborhood looking for his house, I suspected his home was the one flying the large American flag. I knew that Mike, my friend, had served in Vietnam, but, as we spent some time digging up the plants and visiting around his garden, I learned a lot more about his harrowing experience as a marine. You see, Mr. Speaker, Mike's squad was assigned to protect an area in the northern part of south Vietnam. They were a pesky bunch, as Mike put it, and the north Vietnamese grew tired of the constant haranguing, so they launched a counterassault. Mike's squad was outnumbered 10 to 1, and they were hit pretty hard. A call went out for help, but the first helicopter to arrive was blown apart. Mike sustained severe wounds. A bullet to the chest collapsed his lung, shrapnel tore through a foot and a leg, and another bullet grazed his head. To breathe, Mike had to keep clearing his throat with his finger to remove the gurgling blood. And at the point where he could no longer physically fight, he crawled to a slightly more secure place and propped himself up on a sack. Mike told me he remembered two things-- the wind blowing through his hair and his mother. Who would tell her that he had died? Only three Americans survived that battle. Fortunately, another helicopter quickly landed and a corpsman came to Mike's rescue, stabilized him, and helped return him to safety. A doctor performed quick and precision surgery, and the medical personnel nursed him back to health, for which Mike was always grateful. But something always nagged him. He never got a chance to thank the corpsman who risked his own life to save him. And, finally, in 2001, he went online, did some research, and found the man 30 years later. Mike wrote to him and said: I have not forgotten you. [[Page H5908]] Now, Mr. Speaker, it is no secret that our country's economic, political, and cultural settlement is straining under a number of very harsh realities. Concentration of economic and political power, coupled with signs of social collapse, are contributing to a growing sense of vulnerability and anxiety in our society. Amid a divisive and disorienting political season, terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, Orlando, Minnesota, and New York have reminded us of the grave threats to life and our cherished liberties. Take a moment, Mr. Speaker, to notice how many Nebraskans and how many Americans like Mike fly our flag. It means something. The flag stands for an ideal, for a value, for the proposition that all persons have dignity. And when that dignity is safeguarded, a people can flourish. That is America. But I think more people need to hear, Mr. Speaker, that we have not forgotten you. The fundamental questions right now before us are, who are we as a Nation, where are we going as a people, and how will we find our greatness again? Yesterday, Mr. Speaker, I had an extraordinary privilege. I would like to share the story with you and the body. I was invited to attend the dedication of a new veterans memorial in a small town in the heart of the Great Plains north of Lincoln, Nebraska, where I live. This town is called Wahoo. It was actually made famous because in the old David Letterman show he named it as the hometown office. But Wahoo is more than a late night show's joke. It is a place where a community lives, works, and has a deep sense of interconnectedness and well-being. It is a place of extraordinary greatness. In this small town, about 500 people from the entire county came and gathered right there at the courthouse for the dedication of a new memorial honoring the 101 servicemembers who had been killed from the small farming community and the surrounding area--soldiers, troops, military personnel from World War I to our present day. All of their names were read in an honor roll, many having Czech and German names, who were such an important part of the original settlement of that area, as well as the Swedish. When I approached the microphone to say a few words, I recalled the old movie ``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' based upon the old novel. Mr. Speaker, as you will recall, in that movie, the lawyer Atticus Finch gives a defense of a man who is unjustly accused of a crime. The community from which that man had come had to sit in the upper balcony of the courtroom because of the prejudice of that time. And as Atticus Finch was getting ready to leave the courtroom, the reverend, who was in the midst of that community in the gallery, says to his young child, the lawyer's young child: ``Stand up, your father's passing.'' At that beautiful ceremony right there in the Great Plains, it started with the public high school choir and the Catholic high school choir singing our national anthem. When that occurred, no one sat on a bench, no one took a knee. We all stood because it was not about us, it was about them, the men and women before us, living and dead, who had answered the call to service. And whether they had cooked or cleaned or computed or were in the worst conceivable firefight, nonetheless, they said: yes, I will serve, I will sacrifice, for the meaning of our Nation. We live in a time, Mr. Speaker, when our world is screaming for meaning. What we are really searching for is not an answer that can be found here in this body. We have an important role to debate the most pressing issues of the day, whether those are national security, economic security, and even cultural security. The most important answers aren't found necessarily down the street in the White House. They are not going to be answered necessarily in the great debate that is about to occur moments from now on the television. The answer is found in the debate about meaning itself. When we find things that bind us, like this extraordinary ceremony yesterday nestled in the heart of America, where people young and old came to honor our veterans, when we look back to those who came before us, giving them their due in a memorial that appropriately honors them, we bind ourselves in a noble idea that sacrifice for one another, sacrifice, even for a nation, is sometimes not only necessary, but it is worthy of the fullness of the call in the human heart. But we still have hard questions before us. So what should we do? The first pathway, Mr. Speaker, to finding solutions is to adequately identify the problem. And in one word, I believe the problem is fragmentation. What do I mean by that? It is a creeping separateness, whether in economic affairs, government affairs, foreign affairs, or our own basic exchanges in local community life. People are feeling alone, isolated. In many cases, they feel like they lack control over the most basic things, the simple things in their own life. Far remote systems seem to be the new governing order. Informative institutions that used to provide the continuity of tradition and nest people into an ongoing desire and pathway toward hope by giving them the gifts of that tradition and the responsibility nested within community, as well as the accountability, have all become fragmented. These burdens press upon our people in a most profound way, and, in particular, in regards to their own economic well-being. These days, economic measures are on everyone's mind. There is a tremendous amount of anxiety, even hopelessness, in our uncertain times. And while the stock market has certainly rebounded and corporate profits have soured, many families are facing downward mobility, stagnant wages, decreased opportunity, the feeling of disenfranchisement, and the inability to achieve financial security. Part of our problem is our country's damaged micro-enterprise sector, that entrepreneurial space where most new jobs in the country are actually created. And we are not even talking about corporations that are 100 to 500 employees. We are talking about shops that are 1 to 5 people. This morning, I made a phone call as I was getting on the plane to return here from Nebraska because, Mr. Speaker, I received this in the mail. This is a flyer announcing a doors-closing sale from a small business called Havelock Furniture. This furniture company anchors the north end of a little community called Havelock, which is now subsumed into the greater community of Lincoln, Nebraska. It distressed me when I received this. At first, I thought they might be another victim of corporate consolidation, an inability to compete as a small furniture store in a sector that might be, again, increasing the concentration into fewer and fewer hands. So I just picked up the phone, and I called Sue. Now, this is an advertisement for a closing-business sale, and it is giving me a discount if I want to come there and buy something. But Sue lays out, in very heartfelt terms, the reality of their circumstances: The family has been in business for 61 years, and now I am retiring forever. She goes on to say: And I am offering our friends and employees and preferred customers a special discount. Well, I can't ever recall if I have met Sue. And, by the way, at the top of this, Mr. Speaker--I don't know if you can see it--is a picture of the founder, Mel Everson, and it says: In loving memory. As I recall, Sue is his daughter. I called Sue just to find out what was going on, and also to express my thanks for their willingness to be in business this long, carry on an important tradition for an important part of our town, and be an integrated part of an old Main Street that still occupies a unique part of the community where I live. We talked a little bit about what happened. And, fortunately, it wasn't the result of any type of pressure coming from outside economic forces that were beyond her control, it was simply the necessary decision that had to be made for family reasons. But, nonetheless, I felt a heartfelt loss. And why? Because on a deeper level, Sue's business is the loss of a symbol of community mutuality and economic affairs, a gathering place where human interaction reinforces social vibrancy. Mr. Speaker, our country needs a 21st century vision of what economic success can look like. Benign competition with a robust small business sector creates the conditions for a sustainable dynamism, a humane economy that prioritizes personal relationships and [[Page H5909]] community ties, fosters stronger entrepreneurialism, forges better consumer products, and creates more jobs for persons who need them. {time} 2000 Just as a healthy society and the principle of self-responsibility are the preconditions for prosperity, properly ordered markets support social cohesion. Markets at their best are driven by startup innovation and sustained by widespread ownership. The return of small business, with a new participatory economy, can extend the dignity and just rewards of meaningful work. It will help us fight poverty and help us to rebuild our economy in this century. Now, what are some good examples of this economic mutuality I am referring to where no person or no thing is thrown away? I recently saw a presentation by a CEO of a major corporation. He threw up a PowerPoint on the screen, and I thought we were getting ready to look at some boring quarterly earnings projections or something like that; but instead of rolling out the PowerPoints and graphs, the CEO showed a simple picture. It was a picture of a young woman on her wedding day, a bride on her father's arm. The CEO then said this: ``Everyone is someone's daughter. Everyone is someone's son.'' In other words, persons matter--persons matter in a society; persons matter in a business; persons matter as we debate the great public policy issues before us because, ultimately, that is the purpose, the well-being of persons. The point was powerfully made. The understanding of work and the workplace--the proper understanding of work as nested within the workplace--are essential to human dignity and to human happiness; and this CEO of a very large corporation said he believed business could be the greatest force for good in the world. That is a strong and proper perspective. Mr. Speaker, as I was recently looking around my garage, looking to clean out a few things, I came upon an old, antiquated pickax. It is really a substantial piece of hardware. I bought this years ago and used it numbers of times in my yard. Then the handle finally broke, and I had a hard time throwing it away--it is a bad habit I have, I guess. But it sat there in my garage, a substantial piece of iron. So, instead of throwing it away, I took it with me to the local hardware store, and then I went to look at some new ones. I asked the clerk: ``What do you think? Do you sell handles?'' He said: ``No, we do not sell new handles.'' He said: ``You are probably better off buying a new one and putting this one on the wall in the man cave.'' So I went and looked at a new one and toyed with the idea; but then the clerk said: ``Well, look. Let me do a little research for you, and I will get back to you.'' So he did. He went out and found a company in America that made pickax handles out of hickory. He took it a little further. He went ahead and ordered the handle for me, and he replaced it himself. When I went to the store about week later, there it was--a piece of old, old hardware, ready to be put back to work with a replacement handle proudly made in America and made of hickory. If you had done a straight analysis of the cost involved in this repair project, it was not worth it. I only saved about $10 by repairing versus buying a new one. I had to wait a week or so, and I had to go to the store twice, but there are unmeasured benefits here. Let's talk about those. First of all, an old piece of iron is not in a landfill; a renewable resource of hickory wood was deployed; an American company made a little profit; and the hardware store's clerk had the satisfaction of a hand-built opportunity. I will tell you, I must say, I am pretty proud of my refreshed, repurposed pickax, and I put it right to work on some old bushes I had in the yard. More importantly, Mr. Speaker, if we are going to rebuild our economy, thinking about how we manufacture, how we maintain, and how we rebuild what is still useful can unlock the benefits of a well- functioning market system. This small act of taking something old but solid and getting it back into useful service provides some insights on how to better secure economic well-being. The disposable nature of so many goods as they are now manufactured, with the intended life expectancy ever more narrowed, decreases costs in the short term--but cheaper isn't always best. The ability to repair and recycle and to repurpose--to keep the useful life of a resource as long as possible-- is smart economics. It is a fundamental principle of conservation, and it is a key to reviving the small business service sector. Perhaps, Mr. Speaker, this is an emerging trend. I was watching the Olympics. During it, I noticed a commercial in which a major retailer gave a subtle message about cheap imports. During the commercial, as the song ``Dream On'' built up steadily in the background, the commercial featured people waking up, going about the routine of life, getting their kids to school, and making their way to a factory, where they used their hands to make things--tough and gritty work, but connected to a deeper meaning. At the end of the commercial, the company stated it will invest $250 billion in American manufacturing in the years to come. Maybe we are on the front end of a trend, Mr. Speaker. I certainly hope so. An economic model that chases more and more output alone is not a valid measure of value. Our country's economic reboot requires a return to a humane economy--one focused on quality, durability, and the work of human hands and, as much as we can, made in America. Without this focus, we will forever chase that which we cannot find, and perhaps more and more people are realizing that we should shift to what is dependable, not disposable; to what is fixable, not forgettable; to what is reparable and not just replaceable. Using my repurposed hickory-handled, American-made pickax gives me a great deal of time to think about these things, Mr. Speaker. It also gives me a pretty good workout--a winner all the way around. Mr. Speaker, I want to reference something else that I happened to see. There is a show--I am not sure if it is still on--that is called ``Undercover Boss,'' and I have seen it a few times. I find the program to be quite engaging and very, very human. The premise of the show is that the CEO, the chief executive officer, of a major company goes undercover as an employee. Then, from there, he participates in the gritty work of building things, of cleaning up, of working the phones, and of performing basic administrative tasks. During this particular episode that I saw, the boss spent some time out in the field, repairing a broken sewer line. Then he was in an office, answering calls, and was at a manufacturing plant where the equipment was crafted. The CEO was assigned to one of the company's top welders for training at the manufacturing facility. As part of his disguise, he wore safety glasses and a do-rag. The first mistake that the CEO made was that of burning a hole through the metal that he was supposed to be joining. After the welder who was supervising him gently corrected his technique, they took a break, and the conversation turned to job security. The middle-aged welder, who was a long-time, dedicated employee and a team leader at that corporation, told the boss about the worry that he has and that he overhears at the manufacturing plant. Would they just show up one day and see a ``closed'' sign hanging on the cyclone fence? Given what is going on in America, no one knows for sure whether the company would just pack up and move overseas like so many others have. The simple conversation in the break room in middle America captured what so many Americans are justifiably concerned about. Although the government's aggregate statistics show an overall unemployment rate of about 5 percent, the numbers hide a disturbing reality. For too many people, the rhetoric of free markets has not translated into better opportunity or security. As I mentioned, stagnant wages and downward mobility, staggering student loan debt, job insecurity, and the increased cost of living are all real difficulties marking the new normal for an increasing number of families in our society. In another segment of the television show, the disguised CEO had to work on a home drainage system. The elderly woman who lived in the well-kept [[Page H5910]] but very simple house was told that the bill to fix the problem was $1,200. She responded in a very worried voice about her many doctor bills and about how much medicine she had to buy. The employee who was supervising the CEO then paused, considered the situation, and gently spoke back to the elderly woman and said to her: ``Well, how about $500?'' The employee, as it turns out, had taken it upon himself to cut his own commission in order to help this elderly, vulnerable person, all while his undercover boss watched. After several other meaningful encounters with his employees, the show concluded with the CEO's revealing his true identity and commending everyone with whom he had interacted. He made some poignant points about his experiences--how deeply they had touched his life and how they would now impact his management style. To the welder, he said: ``I want you to take the message back: `We are staying in America.' Give them that assurance from me.'' To the man who reduced the bill at the cost of his own salary, he rewarded him for his compassion and dedication. Business can be a force for great good, Mr. Speaker. The true potential of companies depends upon their people for their greatness. In this case, the CEO was willing to do a self-evaluation of his own leadership style and of the very fundamental purpose of the company, itself. Perhaps a scorecard should be kept to feature businesses that do the right thing: trying to keep the best jobs in America, consistently innovating, and paying just salaries to persons who work hard to support themselves and their families. In order to discover--to discover, perhaps, something about himself, to discover the true meaning of work, to discover the true value of the persons under his authority--the CEO went undercover. By doing so, he found what he had not seen: a properly functioning market economy that genuinely works for both profits and persons, repairing fractures in our society, and enhancing community interdependency. That is the point, Mr. Speaker: community interdependency is the true source of our Nation's strength. When I was a much younger man, I owned a rear-wheel drive Ford Bronco II. They don't make them anymore. I loved that little truck. I sold it shortly after I was married. That little truck was great for that time in my life, but navigating winter conditions could be a bit tough. One night, while traveling on an interstate during really forboding weather, I came over the crest of a hill, and what lay before me was surreal. It must have happened just seconds before. A large 18-wheeler truck had jackknifed. Cars were spun in every direction, flung into the median. There was a clear sheet of ice that no one had expected. {time} 2015 In an instant, my reality changed. In an instant, everything changed. I had to make a choice. I rapidly decreased my speed, gripped the wheel, and focused my total attention on the road before me only just barely navigating the treachery. Mr. Speaker, many Americans feel that they have been tossed around in a bewildering unpredictability of our current policy, economic, and political dynamics. Many Americans are looking for new leadership that offers a compelling, inspirational, and stable vision that can restore the true security of our Nation. If we so choose, one of the strengths of the American system of government is its capacity for constant replenishment. In the midst of an unpredictable government transition season, it may sound a bit peculiar to speak of opportunity. But could this moment give us the chance, as a people, to reassess and realign? Perhaps so, if we so choose. As we began this conversation, Mr. Speaker, I talked about pointing to the problems in order to understand solutions. I think a stronger America might be glimpsed through four mutually supporting principles: government decentralization, economic patriotism, foreign policy realism, and social conservation. Mr. Speaker, just like every football game has four quarters, let's think of our solutions as our four-quarter game plan: government decentralization, economic patriotism, foreign policy realism, and social conservation. What do I mean? First, a return to a more decentralized form of government will restore an important source of America's strength. I, in no way, wish to belittle the essential important debates that occur in this body and elsewhere in the Federal Government. We have a role. We have a role to create the conditions so that the rest of society can flourish. The ultimate role we have is to seek justice and the just structures that can bring about order for persons and communities to flourish. When the Federal Government grows beyond its effectiveness, it infringes upon basic liberties, it stifles innovation, it crushes creativity, and it also takes away the responsibility that we have for one another. A creeping tendency to nationalize every conceivable type of problem erodes community resolve. Now, while the Federal Government does have a central role in maintaining the guardrails for stability, the rule of law, and a fair opportunity economy, America's governing system is designed to operate most effectively at different levels. Those close to an opportunity or a problem ought to have the first authority to seize the opportunity or solve the problem. I find it notable that the veterans memorial ceremony that I went to just yesterday did not include any government funds. It was made up of community resolve and community sacrifice. As a quick civics lesson, as an aside, the Rules Committee on which the gentleman from Georgia sits is still working tonight, trying to craft the structure for the debate that will occur on certain pieces of legislation to come before us in short order. Let me return to something I said, Mr. Speaker. Just like every football game has four quarters, I believe we ought to think of our solutions as a four-quarter game plan. The first is returning to a healthy concept of decentralized government, a healthy Federalism where those closest to a responsibility or opportunity have first-order priority in taking responsibility or seizing that opportunity, again, not to denigrate the very essential role that the Federal Government plays in creating the conditions for stability and rule of law and a just playing field, particularly in the economy, as well as national security, but other levels of governance are essential to community well-being. Second, economic inclusion or economic patriotism should help America recover from an arthritic economy. As I mentioned earlier, although the government's aggregate statistics show an overall unemployment rate at about 5 percent, these numbers continue to hide certain realities. There are stagnant wages and downward mobility making life very difficult for a number of families. Mr. Speaker, it is sad to say this, but this Washington-Wall Street axis, which promotes the transnational corporation as the new ruling entity for society, cannot secure the well-being of our economy. They cannot. Instead of a globalized supply-side elitism, America needs a vibrant marketplace of her own that expands the space for constructive interdependency and community dynamism which will fight poverty and drive innovation, at the heart of which, again, is small business. Small business is the key, along with a fair regulatory environment and the right type of healthcare reform that will actually end up decreasing cost, while protecting vulnerable persons and reset the architecture so that we have a 21st century healthcare system that is truly just, that is fair, that is actually going to achieve the conditions for creativity and innovation in the marketplace. What we have now is a healthcare system that is an increasing drag on the small business sector; and, therefore, the number of jobs that we see created are going down. We are living in an entrepreneurial winter--the number of jobs being created are less from small businesses, are less than the number of small businesses that are actually dying. We are in an entrepreneurial winter. This has never happened before in the history of our country. So, focusing on the small business sector and returning to, again, a fair regulatory environment and appropriately addressing a new architecture for health care, which doesn't simply shift costs but, at its heart, protects vulnerable persons, improves [[Page H5911]] healthcare outcomes and reduces cost is a key to restoring the small business sector. Third key is foreign policy realism. What do I mean? Foreign policy realism charts a course between overinterventionalism and isolationism. America has an important role to play on the global stage today. However, many Americans are alarmed at an exhausted, drifting, and often counterproductive foreign policy. The posture of foreign policy adventurism, sometimes coupled with naive assumptions about democracy promotion, requires a recalibration. Leveraging American strength through strategic international relationships and authentic friendships will help us navigate the 21st century marked by a changing geopolitical framework. Mr. Speaker, I believe in the three Ds: strong defense, smart diplomacy, sustainable development. That is the right balance in our foreign policy considerations. Fourth key is social conservation. Social conservation provides the conditions for order, opportunity, and happiness. We usually don't put those together, social and conservation. We think of conservation as the important protection of our land and water and the air we breathe, not throwing things away unnecessarily. Thinking of the ideals of the ecosystem where all things are interdependent, or looking out into the vast horizons of nature and letting it pull ourselves to a higher realm of that which is beautiful, even that which is divine, we have all had that experience. We know it in nature. We see it. Could we possibly see the idea of an ecosystem of community where we actually think that it is more than politics for the promotion of sustainable values? As society has become more fragmented, it is harder and harder for us to craft policies that meet society's needs. Washington cannot spend enough fast enough to fix the deep wounds in our culture, Mr. Speaker. Social conservation recognizes that family life, faith life, and civic life provide a continuity of tradition, giving meaning to life and creating stability, particularly for children. Those of us who have had the scarring experience of coming from broken situations, we know this intuitively. Those of us who struggled with the deep scars of having what you know and what keeps you safe torn from you, we know that the formative institutions that preserve the good are invaluable to opportunities later in life. Our sense of well-being, the strength of our Nation ultimately does depend upon the strength of the formative institutions that give rise to family life, faith life, and civic life. That is the strength of America. We are confronting intensifying struggles about the direction of our country, and the fault lines are, sadly, widened. I think there are things that still bind us. I would like to think that what I am saying speaks to every Member of Congress here, that it transcends the superficial political boundaries that we set up that are, yes, based upon the different philosophical perspectives on the nature of what Washington ought to be and not. But I would like to think, again, that this rises above, because they are binding elements of the human heart. It is what we all long for: to be nested, to be secure within a community of loving persons around us who care enough to hold us accountable, who care enough to demand that we take responsibility for them and with them. Although we are encountering rough weather in our country, we can choose to rediscover this best sense of ourselves. We can choose to rediscover commonsense governance, which will uphold these ideals and be built upon them. We can choose right-sized economic models. We can choose to rediscover universal foundational values that are consistent with the desire of all persons' hearts. This is how the greatness can be restored again. This is how we make America great again. This is how we find ourselves and find one another and find a vision that binds us together and makes us all proud to stand as America's flag is flown. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [House] [Pages H5907-H5911] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 1945 AMERICA HAS NOT FORGOTTEN YOU The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, a friend of mine works part time in a hardware store. He is retired from several other careers, but he continues to enjoy helping people in a retail-service environment. Recently, he kindly gave me, as we were talking about gardening, some hosta plants that he had grown. As I drove through his neighborhood looking for his house, I suspected his home was the one flying the large American flag. I knew that Mike, my friend, had served in Vietnam, but, as we spent some time digging up the plants and visiting around his garden, I learned a lot more about his harrowing experience as a marine. You see, Mr. Speaker, Mike's squad was assigned to protect an area in the northern part of south Vietnam. They were a pesky bunch, as Mike put it, and the north Vietnamese grew tired of the constant haranguing, so they launched a counterassault. Mike's squad was outnumbered 10 to 1, and they were hit pretty hard. A call went out for help, but the first helicopter to arrive was blown apart. Mike sustained severe wounds. A bullet to the chest collapsed his lung, shrapnel tore through a foot and a leg, and another bullet grazed his head. To breathe, Mike had to keep clearing his throat with his finger to remove the gurgling blood. And at the point where he could no longer physically fight, he crawled to a slightly more secure place and propped himself up on a sack. Mike told me he remembered two things-- the wind blowing through his hair and his mother. Who would tell her that he had died? Only three Americans survived that battle. Fortunately, another helicopter quickly landed and a corpsman came to Mike's rescue, stabilized him, and helped return him to safety. A doctor performed quick and precision surgery, and the medical personnel nursed him back to health, for which Mike was always grateful. But something always nagged him. He never got a chance to thank the corpsman who risked his own life to save him. And, finally, in 2001, he went online, did some research, and found the man 30 years later. Mike wrote to him and said: I have not forgotten you. [[Page H5908]] Now, Mr. Speaker, it is no secret that our country's economic, political, and cultural settlement is straining under a number of very harsh realities. Concentration of economic and political power, coupled with signs of social collapse, are contributing to a growing sense of vulnerability and anxiety in our society. Amid a divisive and disorienting political season, terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, Orlando, Minnesota, and New York have reminded us of the grave threats to life and our cherished liberties. Take a moment, Mr. Speaker, to notice how many Nebraskans and how many Americans like Mike fly our flag. It means something. The flag stands for an ideal, for a value, for the proposition that all persons have dignity. And when that dignity is safeguarded, a people can flourish. That is America. But I think more people need to hear, Mr. Speaker, that we have not forgotten you. The fundamental questions right now before us are, who are we as a Nation, where are we going as a people, and how will we find our greatness again? Yesterday, Mr. Speaker, I had an extraordinary privilege. I would like to share the story with you and the body. I was invited to attend the dedication of a new veterans memorial in a small town in the heart of the Great Plains north of Lincoln, Nebraska, where I live. This town is called Wahoo. It was actually made famous because in the old David Letterman show he named it as the hometown office. But Wahoo is more than a late night show's joke. It is a place where a community lives, works, and has a deep sense of interconnectedness and well-being. It is a place of extraordinary greatness. In this small town, about 500 people from the entire county came and gathered right there at the courthouse for the dedication of a new memorial honoring the 101 servicemembers who had been killed from the small farming community and the surrounding area--soldiers, troops, military personnel from World War I to our present day. All of their names were read in an honor roll, many having Czech and German names, who were such an important part of the original settlement of that area, as well as the Swedish. When I approached the microphone to say a few words, I recalled the old movie ``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' based upon the old novel. Mr. Speaker, as you will recall, in that movie, the lawyer Atticus Finch gives a defense of a man who is unjustly accused of a crime. The community from which that man had come had to sit in the upper balcony of the courtroom because of the prejudice of that time. And as Atticus Finch was getting ready to leave the courtroom, the reverend, who was in the midst of that community in the gallery, says to his young child, the lawyer's young child: ``Stand up, your father's passing.'' At that beautiful ceremony right there in the Great Plains, it started with the public high school choir and the Catholic high school choir singing our national anthem. When that occurred, no one sat on a bench, no one took a knee. We all stood because it was not about us, it was about them, the men and women before us, living and dead, who had answered the call to service. And whether they had cooked or cleaned or computed or were in the worst conceivable firefight, nonetheless, they said: yes, I will serve, I will sacrifice, for the meaning of our Nation. We live in a time, Mr. Speaker, when our world is screaming for meaning. What we are really searching for is not an answer that can be found here in this body. We have an important role to debate the most pressing issues of the day, whether those are national security, economic security, and even cultural security. The most important answers aren't found necessarily down the street in the White House. They are not going to be answered necessarily in the great debate that is about to occur moments from now on the television. The answer is found in the debate about meaning itself. When we find things that bind us, like this extraordinary ceremony yesterday nestled in the heart of America, where people young and old came to honor our veterans, when we look back to those who came before us, giving them their due in a memorial that appropriately honors them, we bind ourselves in a noble idea that sacrifice for one another, sacrifice, even for a nation, is sometimes not only necessary, but it is worthy of the fullness of the call in the human heart. But we still have hard questions before us. So what should we do? The first pathway, Mr. Speaker, to finding solutions is to adequately identify the problem. And in one word, I believe the problem is fragmentation. What do I mean by that? It is a creeping separateness, whether in economic affairs, government affairs, foreign affairs, or our own basic exchanges in local community life. People are feeling alone, isolated. In many cases, they feel like they lack control over the most basic things, the simple things in their own life. Far remote systems seem to be the new governing order. Informative institutions that used to provide the continuity of tradition and nest people into an ongoing desire and pathway toward hope by giving them the gifts of that tradition and the responsibility nested within community, as well as the accountability, have all become fragmented. These burdens press upon our people in a most profound way, and, in particular, in regards to their own economic well-being. These days, economic measures are on everyone's mind. There is a tremendous amount of anxiety, even hopelessness, in our uncertain times. And while the stock market has certainly rebounded and corporate profits have soured, many families are facing downward mobility, stagnant wages, decreased opportunity, the feeling of disenfranchisement, and the inability to achieve financial security. Part of our problem is our country's damaged micro-enterprise sector, that entrepreneurial space where most new jobs in the country are actually created. And we are not even talking about corporations that are 100 to 500 employees. We are talking about shops that are 1 to 5 people. This morning, I made a phone call as I was getting on the plane to return here from Nebraska because, Mr. Speaker, I received this in the mail. This is a flyer announcing a doors-closing sale from a small business called Havelock Furniture. This furniture company anchors the north end of a little community called Havelock, which is now subsumed into the greater community of Lincoln, Nebraska. It distressed me when I received this. At first, I thought they might be another victim of corporate consolidation, an inability to compete as a small furniture store in a sector that might be, again, increasing the concentration into fewer and fewer hands. So I just picked up the phone, and I called Sue. Now, this is an advertisement for a closing-business sale, and it is giving me a discount if I want to come there and buy something. But Sue lays out, in very heartfelt terms, the reality of their circumstances: The family has been in business for 61 years, and now I am retiring forever. She goes on to say: And I am offering our friends and employees and preferred customers a special discount. Well, I can't ever recall if I have met Sue. And, by the way, at the top of this, Mr. Speaker--I don't know if you can see it--is a picture of the founder, Mel Everson, and it says: In loving memory. As I recall, Sue is his daughter. I called Sue just to find out what was going on, and also to express my thanks for their willingness to be in business this long, carry on an important tradition for an important part of our town, and be an integrated part of an old Main Street that still occupies a unique part of the community where I live. We talked a little bit about what happened. And, fortunately, it wasn't the result of any type of pressure coming from outside economic forces that were beyond her control, it was simply the necessary decision that had to be made for family reasons. But, nonetheless, I felt a heartfelt loss. And why? Because on a deeper level, Sue's business is the loss of a symbol of community mutuality and economic affairs, a gathering place where human interaction reinforces social vibrancy. Mr. Speaker, our country needs a 21st century vision of what economic success can look like. Benign competition with a robust small business sector creates the conditions for a sustainable dynamism, a humane economy that prioritizes personal relationships and [[Page H5909]] community ties, fosters stronger entrepreneurialism, forges better consumer products, and creates more jobs for persons who need them. {time} 2000 Just as a healthy society and the principle of self-responsibility are the preconditions for prosperity, properly ordered markets support social cohesion. Markets at their best are driven by startup innovation and sustained by widespread ownership. The return of small business, with a new participatory economy, can extend the dignity and just rewards of meaningful work. It will help us fight poverty and help us to rebuild our economy in this century. Now, what are some good examples of this economic mutuality I am referring to where no person or no thing is thrown away? I recently saw a presentation by a CEO of a major corporation. He threw up a PowerPoint on the screen, and I thought we were getting ready to look at some boring quarterly earnings projections or something like that; but instead of rolling out the PowerPoints and graphs, the CEO showed a simple picture. It was a picture of a young woman on her wedding day, a bride on her father's arm. The CEO then said this: ``Everyone is someone's daughter. Everyone is someone's son.'' In other words, persons matter--persons matter in a society; persons matter in a business; persons matter as we debate the great public policy issues before us because, ultimately, that is the purpose, the well-being of persons. The point was powerfully made. The understanding of work and the workplace--the proper understanding of work as nested within the workplace--are essential to human dignity and to human happiness; and this CEO of a very large corporation said he believed business could be the greatest force for good in the world. That is a strong and proper perspective. Mr. Speaker, as I was recently looking around my garage, looking to clean out a few things, I came upon an old, antiquated pickax. It is really a substantial piece of hardware. I bought this years ago and used it numbers of times in my yard. Then the handle finally broke, and I had a hard time throwing it away--it is a bad habit I have, I guess. But it sat there in my garage, a substantial piece of iron. So, instead of throwing it away, I took it with me to the local hardware store, and then I went to look at some new ones. I asked the clerk: ``What do you think? Do you sell handles?'' He said: ``No, we do not sell new handles.'' He said: ``You are probably better off buying a new one and putting this one on the wall in the man cave.'' So I went and looked at a new one and toyed with the idea; but then the clerk said: ``Well, look. Let me do a little research for you, and I will get back to you.'' So he did. He went out and found a company in America that made pickax handles out of hickory. He took it a little further. He went ahead and ordered the handle for me, and he replaced it himself. When I went to the store about week later, there it was--a piece of old, old hardware, ready to be put back to work with a replacement handle proudly made in America and made of hickory. If you had done a straight analysis of the cost involved in this repair project, it was not worth it. I only saved about $10 by repairing versus buying a new one. I had to wait a week or so, and I had to go to the store twice, but there are unmeasured benefits here. Let's talk about those. First of all, an old piece of iron is not in a landfill; a renewable resource of hickory wood was deployed; an American company made a little profit; and the hardware store's clerk had the satisfaction of a hand-built opportunity. I will tell you, I must say, I am pretty proud of my refreshed, repurposed pickax, and I put it right to work on some old bushes I had in the yard. More importantly, Mr. Speaker, if we are going to rebuild our economy, thinking about how we manufacture, how we maintain, and how we rebuild what is still useful can unlock the benefits of a well- functioning market system. This small act of taking something old but solid and getting it back into useful service provides some insights on how to better secure economic well-being. The disposable nature of so many goods as they are now manufactured, with the intended life expectancy ever more narrowed, decreases costs in the short term--but cheaper isn't always best. The ability to repair and recycle and to repurpose--to keep the useful life of a resource as long as possible-- is smart economics. It is a fundamental principle of conservation, and it is a key to reviving the small business service sector. Perhaps, Mr. Speaker, this is an emerging trend. I was watching the Olympics. During it, I noticed a commercial in which a major retailer gave a subtle message about cheap imports. During the commercial, as the song ``Dream On'' built up steadily in the background, the commercial featured people waking up, going about the routine of life, getting their kids to school, and making their way to a factory, where they used their hands to make things--tough and gritty work, but connected to a deeper meaning. At the end of the commercial, the company stated it will invest $250 billion in American manufacturing in the years to come. Maybe we are on the front end of a trend, Mr. Speaker. I certainly hope so. An economic model that chases more and more output alone is not a valid measure of value. Our country's economic reboot requires a return to a humane economy--one focused on quality, durability, and the work of human hands and, as much as we can, made in America. Without this focus, we will forever chase that which we cannot find, and perhaps more and more people are realizing that we should shift to what is dependable, not disposable; to what is fixable, not forgettable; to what is reparable and not just replaceable. Using my repurposed hickory-handled, American-made pickax gives me a great deal of time to think about these things, Mr. Speaker. It also gives me a pretty good workout--a winner all the way around. Mr. Speaker, I want to reference something else that I happened to see. There is a show--I am not sure if it is still on--that is called ``Undercover Boss,'' and I have seen it a few times. I find the program to be quite engaging and very, very human. The premise of the show is that the CEO, the chief executive officer, of a major company goes undercover as an employee. Then, from there, he participates in the gritty work of building things, of cleaning up, of working the phones, and of performing basic administrative tasks. During this particular episode that I saw, the boss spent some time out in the field, repairing a broken sewer line. Then he was in an office, answering calls, and was at a manufacturing plant where the equipment was crafted. The CEO was assigned to one of the company's top welders for training at the manufacturing facility. As part of his disguise, he wore safety glasses and a do-rag. The first mistake that the CEO made was that of burning a hole through the metal that he was supposed to be joining. After the welder who was supervising him gently corrected his technique, they took a break, and the conversation turned to job security. The middle-aged welder, who was a long-time, dedicated employee and a team leader at that corporation, told the boss about the worry that he has and that he overhears at the manufacturing plant. Would they just show up one day and see a ``closed'' sign hanging on the cyclone fence? Given what is going on in America, no one knows for sure whether the company would just pack up and move overseas like so many others have. The simple conversation in the break room in middle America captured what so many Americans are justifiably concerned about. Although the government's aggregate statistics show an overall unemployment rate of about 5 percent, the numbers hide a disturbing reality. For too many people, the rhetoric of free markets has not translated into better opportunity or security. As I mentioned, stagnant wages and downward mobility, staggering student loan debt, job insecurity, and the increased cost of living are all real difficulties marking the new normal for an increasing number of families in our society. In another segment of the television show, the disguised CEO had to work on a home drainage system. The elderly woman who lived in the well-kept [[Page H5910]] but very simple house was told that the bill to fix the problem was $1,200. She responded in a very worried voice about her many doctor bills and about how much medicine she had to buy. The employee who was supervising the CEO then paused, considered the situation, and gently spoke back to the elderly woman and said to her: ``Well, how about $500?'' The employee, as it turns out, had taken it upon himself to cut his own commission in order to help this elderly, vulnerable person, all while his undercover boss watched. After several other meaningful encounters with his employees, the show concluded with the CEO's revealing his true identity and commending everyone with whom he had interacted. He made some poignant points about his experiences--how deeply they had touched his life and how they would now impact his management style. To the welder, he said: ``I want you to take the message back: `We are staying in America.' Give them that assurance from me.'' To the man who reduced the bill at the cost of his own salary, he rewarded him for his compassion and dedication. Business can be a force for great good, Mr. Speaker. The true potential of companies depends upon their people for their greatness. In this case, the CEO was willing to do a self-evaluation of his own leadership style and of the very fundamental purpose of the company, itself. Perhaps a scorecard should be kept to feature businesses that do the right thing: trying to keep the best jobs in America, consistently innovating, and paying just salaries to persons who work hard to support themselves and their families. In order to discover--to discover, perhaps, something about himself, to discover the true meaning of work, to discover the true value of the persons under his authority--the CEO went undercover. By doing so, he found what he had not seen: a properly functioning market economy that genuinely works for both profits and persons, repairing fractures in our society, and enhancing community interdependency. That is the point, Mr. Speaker: community interdependency is the true source of our Nation's strength. When I was a much younger man, I owned a rear-wheel drive Ford Bronco II. They don't make them anymore. I loved that little truck. I sold it shortly after I was married. That little truck was great for that time in my life, but navigating winter conditions could be a bit tough. One night, while traveling on an interstate during really forboding weather, I came over the crest of a hill, and what lay before me was surreal. It must have happened just seconds before. A large 18-wheeler truck had jackknifed. Cars were spun in every direction, flung into the median. There was a clear sheet of ice that no one had expected. {time} 2015 In an instant, my reality changed. In an instant, everything changed. I had to make a choice. I rapidly decreased my speed, gripped the wheel, and focused my total attention on the road before me only just barely navigating the treachery. Mr. Speaker, many Americans feel that they have been tossed around in a bewildering unpredictability of our current policy, economic, and political dynamics. Many Americans are looking for new leadership that offers a compelling, inspirational, and stable vision that can restore the true security of our Nation. If we so choose, one of the strengths of the American system of government is its capacity for constant replenishment. In the midst of an unpredictable government transition season, it may sound a bit peculiar to speak of opportunity. But could this moment give us the chance, as a people, to reassess and realign? Perhaps so, if we so choose. As we began this conversation, Mr. Speaker, I talked about pointing to the problems in order to understand solutions. I think a stronger America might be glimpsed through four mutually supporting principles: government decentralization, economic patriotism, foreign policy realism, and social conservation. Mr. Speaker, just like every football game has four quarters, let's think of our solutions as our four-quarter game plan: government decentralization, economic patriotism, foreign policy realism, and social conservation. What do I mean? First, a return to a more decentralized form of government will restore an important source of America's strength. I, in no way, wish to belittle the essential important debates that occur in this body and elsewhere in the Federal Government. We have a role. We have a role to create the conditions so that the rest of society can flourish. The ultimate role we have is to seek justice and the just structures that can bring about order for persons and communities to flourish. When the Federal Government grows beyond its effectiveness, it infringes upon basic liberties, it stifles innovation, it crushes creativity, and it also takes away the responsibility that we have for one another. A creeping tendency to nationalize every conceivable type of problem erodes community resolve. Now, while the Federal Government does have a central role in maintaining the guardrails for stability, the rule of law, and a fair opportunity economy, America's governing system is designed to operate most effectively at different levels. Those close to an opportunity or a problem ought to have the first authority to seize the opportunity or solve the problem. I find it notable that the veterans memorial ceremony that I went to just yesterday did not include any government funds. It was made up of community resolve and community sacrifice. As a quick civics lesson, as an aside, the Rules Committee on which the gentleman from Georgia sits is still working tonight, trying to craft the structure for the debate that will occur on certain pieces of legislation to come before us in short order. Let me return to something I said, Mr. Speaker. Just like every football game has four quarters, I believe we ought to think of our solutions as a four-quarter game plan. The first is returning to a healthy concept of decentralized government, a healthy Federalism where those closest to a responsibility or opportunity have first-order priority in taking responsibility or seizing that opportunity, again, not to denigrate the very essential role that the Federal Government plays in creating the conditions for stability and rule of law and a just playing field, particularly in the economy, as well as national security, but other levels of governance are essential to community well-being. Second, economic inclusion or economic patriotism should help America recover from an arthritic economy. As I mentioned earlier, although the government's aggregate statistics show an overall unemployment rate at about 5 percent, these numbers continue to hide certain realities. There are stagnant wages and downward mobility making life very difficult for a number of families. Mr. Speaker, it is sad to say this, but this Washington-Wall Street axis, which promotes the transnational corporation as the new ruling entity for society, cannot secure the well-being of our economy. They cannot. Instead of a globalized supply-side elitism, America needs a vibrant marketplace of her own that expands the space for constructive interdependency and community dynamism which will fight poverty and drive innovation, at the heart of which, again, is small business. Small business is the key, along with a fair regulatory environment and the right type of healthcare reform that will actually end up decreasing cost, while protecting vulnerable persons and reset the architecture so that we have a 21st century healthcare system that is truly just, that is fair, that is actually going to achieve the conditions for creativity and innovation in the marketplace. What we have now is a healthcare system that is an increasing drag on the small business sector; and, therefore, the number of jobs that we see created are going down. We are living in an entrepreneurial winter--the number of jobs being created are less from small businesses, are less than the number of small businesses that are actually dying. We are in an entrepreneurial winter. This has never happened before in the history of our country. So, focusing on the small business sector and returning to, again, a fair regulatory environment and appropriately addressing a new architecture for health care, which doesn't simply shift costs but, at its heart, protects vulnerable persons, improves [[Page H5911]] healthcare outcomes and reduces cost is a key to restoring the small business sector. Third key is foreign policy realism. What do I mean? Foreign policy realism charts a course between overinterventionalism and isolationism. America has an important role to play on the global stage today. However, many Americans are alarmed at an exhausted, drifting, and often counterproductive foreign policy. The posture of foreign policy adventurism, sometimes coupled with naive assumptions about democracy promotion, requires a recalibration. Leveraging American strength through strategic international relationships and authentic friendships will help us navigate the 21st century marked by a changing geopolitical framework. Mr. Speaker, I believe in the three Ds: strong defense, smart diplomacy, sustainable development. That is the right balance in our foreign policy considerations. Fourth key is social conservation. Social conservation provides the conditions for order, opportunity, and happiness. We usually don't put those together, social and conservation. We think of conservation as the important protection of our land and water and the air we breathe, not throwing things away unnecessarily. Thinking of the ideals of the ecosystem where all things are interdependent, or looking out into the vast horizons of nature and letting it pull ourselves to a higher realm of that which is beautiful, even that which is divine, we have all had that experience. We know it in nature. We see it. Could we possibly see the idea of an ecosystem of community where we actually think that it is more than politics for the promotion of sustainable values? As society has become more fragmented, it is harder and harder for us to craft policies that meet society's needs. Washington cannot spend enough fast enough to fix the deep wounds in our culture, Mr. Speaker. Social conservation recognizes that family life, faith life, and civic life provide a continuity of tradition, giving meaning to life and creating stability, particularly for children. Those of us who have had the scarring experience of coming from broken situations, we know this intuitively. Those of us who struggled with the deep scars of having what you know and what keeps you safe torn from you, we know that the formative institutions that preserve the good are invaluable to opportunities later in life. Our sense of well-being, the strength of our Nation ultimately does depend upon the strength of the formative institutions that give rise to family life, faith life, and civic life. That is the strength of America. We are confronting intensifying struggles about the direction of our country, and the fault lines are, sadly, widened. I think there are things that still bind us. I would like to think that what I am saying speaks to every Member of Congress here, that it transcends the superficial political boundaries that we set up that are, yes, based upon the different philosophical perspectives on the nature of what Washington ought to be and not. But I would like to think, again, that this rises above, because they are binding elements of the human heart. It is what we all long for: to be nested, to be secure within a community of loving persons around us who care enough to hold us accountable, who care enough to demand that we take responsibility for them and with them. Although we are encountering rough weather in our country, we can choose to rediscover this best sense of ourselves. We can choose to rediscover commonsense governance, which will uphold these ideals and be built upon them. We can choose right-sized economic models. We can choose to rediscover universal foundational values that are consistent with the desire of all persons' hearts. This is how the greatness can be restored again. This is how we make America great again. This is how we find ourselves and find one another and find a vision that binds us together and makes us all proud to stand as America's flag is flown. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [House] [Pages H5907-H5911] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 1945 AMERICA HAS NOT FORGOTTEN YOU The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, a friend of mine works part time in a hardware store. He is retired from several other careers, but he continues to enjoy helping people in a retail-service environment. Recently, he kindly gave me, as we were talking about gardening, some hosta plants that he had grown. As I drove through his neighborhood looking for his house, I suspected his home was the one flying the large American flag. I knew that Mike, my friend, had served in Vietnam, but, as we spent some time digging up the plants and visiting around his garden, I learned a lot more about his harrowing experience as a marine. You see, Mr. Speaker, Mike's squad was assigned to protect an area in the northern part of south Vietnam. They were a pesky bunch, as Mike put it, and the north Vietnamese grew tired of the constant haranguing, so they launched a counterassault. Mike's squad was outnumbered 10 to 1, and they were hit pretty hard. A call went out for help, but the first helicopter to arrive was blown apart. Mike sustained severe wounds. A bullet to the chest collapsed his lung, shrapnel tore through a foot and a leg, and another bullet grazed his head. To breathe, Mike had to keep clearing his throat with his finger to remove the gurgling blood. And at the point where he could no longer physically fight, he crawled to a slightly more secure place and propped himself up on a sack. Mike told me he remembered two things-- the wind blowing through his hair and his mother. Who would tell her that he had died? Only three Americans survived that battle. Fortunately, another helicopter quickly landed and a corpsman came to Mike's rescue, stabilized him, and helped return him to safety. A doctor performed quick and precision surgery, and the medical personnel nursed him back to health, for which Mike was always grateful. But something always nagged him. He never got a chance to thank the corpsman who risked his own life to save him. And, finally, in 2001, he went online, did some research, and found the man 30 years later. Mike wrote to him and said: I have not forgotten you. [[Page H5908]] Now, Mr. Speaker, it is no secret that our country's economic, political, and cultural settlement is straining under a number of very harsh realities. Concentration of economic and political power, coupled with signs of social collapse, are contributing to a growing sense of vulnerability and anxiety in our society. Amid a divisive and disorienting political season, terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, Orlando, Minnesota, and New York have reminded us of the grave threats to life and our cherished liberties. Take a moment, Mr. Speaker, to notice how many Nebraskans and how many Americans like Mike fly our flag. It means something. The flag stands for an ideal, for a value, for the proposition that all persons have dignity. And when that dignity is safeguarded, a people can flourish. That is America. But I think more people need to hear, Mr. Speaker, that we have not forgotten you. The fundamental questions right now before us are, who are we as a Nation, where are we going as a people, and how will we find our greatness again? Yesterday, Mr. Speaker, I had an extraordinary privilege. I would like to share the story with you and the body. I was invited to attend the dedication of a new veterans memorial in a small town in the heart of the Great Plains north of Lincoln, Nebraska, where I live. This town is called Wahoo. It was actually made famous because in the old David Letterman show he named it as the hometown office. But Wahoo is more than a late night show's joke. It is a place where a community lives, works, and has a deep sense of interconnectedness and well-being. It is a place of extraordinary greatness. In this small town, about 500 people from the entire county came and gathered right there at the courthouse for the dedication of a new memorial honoring the 101 servicemembers who had been killed from the small farming community and the surrounding area--soldiers, troops, military personnel from World War I to our present day. All of their names were read in an honor roll, many having Czech and German names, who were such an important part of the original settlement of that area, as well as the Swedish. When I approached the microphone to say a few words, I recalled the old movie ``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' based upon the old novel. Mr. Speaker, as you will recall, in that movie, the lawyer Atticus Finch gives a defense of a man who is unjustly accused of a crime. The community from which that man had come had to sit in the upper balcony of the courtroom because of the prejudice of that time. And as Atticus Finch was getting ready to leave the courtroom, the reverend, who was in the midst of that community in the gallery, says to his young child, the lawyer's young child: ``Stand up, your father's passing.'' At that beautiful ceremony right there in the Great Plains, it started with the public high school choir and the Catholic high school choir singing our national anthem. When that occurred, no one sat on a bench, no one took a knee. We all stood because it was not about us, it was about them, the men and women before us, living and dead, who had answered the call to service. And whether they had cooked or cleaned or computed or were in the worst conceivable firefight, nonetheless, they said: yes, I will serve, I will sacrifice, for the meaning of our Nation. We live in a time, Mr. Speaker, when our world is screaming for meaning. What we are really searching for is not an answer that can be found here in this body. We have an important role to debate the most pressing issues of the day, whether those are national security, economic security, and even cultural security. The most important answers aren't found necessarily down the street in the White House. They are not going to be answered necessarily in the great debate that is about to occur moments from now on the television. The answer is found in the debate about meaning itself. When we find things that bind us, like this extraordinary ceremony yesterday nestled in the heart of America, where people young and old came to honor our veterans, when we look back to those who came before us, giving them their due in a memorial that appropriately honors them, we bind ourselves in a noble idea that sacrifice for one another, sacrifice, even for a nation, is sometimes not only necessary, but it is worthy of the fullness of the call in the human heart. But we still have hard questions before us. So what should we do? The first pathway, Mr. Speaker, to finding solutions is to adequately identify the problem. And in one word, I believe the problem is fragmentation. What do I mean by that? It is a creeping separateness, whether in economic affairs, government affairs, foreign affairs, or our own basic exchanges in local community life. People are feeling alone, isolated. In many cases, they feel like they lack control over the most basic things, the simple things in their own life. Far remote systems seem to be the new governing order. Informative institutions that used to provide the continuity of tradition and nest people into an ongoing desire and pathway toward hope by giving them the gifts of that tradition and the responsibility nested within community, as well as the accountability, have all become fragmented. These burdens press upon our people in a most profound way, and, in particular, in regards to their own economic well-being. These days, economic measures are on everyone's mind. There is a tremendous amount of anxiety, even hopelessness, in our uncertain times. And while the stock market has certainly rebounded and corporate profits have soured, many families are facing downward mobility, stagnant wages, decreased opportunity, the feeling of disenfranchisement, and the inability to achieve financial security. Part of our problem is our country's damaged micro-enterprise sector, that entrepreneurial space where most new jobs in the country are actually created. And we are not even talking about corporations that are 100 to 500 employees. We are talking about shops that are 1 to 5 people. This morning, I made a phone call as I was getting on the plane to return here from Nebraska because, Mr. Speaker, I received this in the mail. This is a flyer announcing a doors-closing sale from a small business called Havelock Furniture. This furniture company anchors the north end of a little community called Havelock, which is now subsumed into the greater community of Lincoln, Nebraska. It distressed me when I received this. At first, I thought they might be another victim of corporate consolidation, an inability to compete as a small furniture store in a sector that might be, again, increasing the concentration into fewer and fewer hands. So I just picked up the phone, and I called Sue. Now, this is an advertisement for a closing-business sale, and it is giving me a discount if I want to come there and buy something. But Sue lays out, in very heartfelt terms, the reality of their circumstances: The family has been in business for 61 years, and now I am retiring forever. She goes on to say: And I am offering our friends and employees and preferred customers a special discount. Well, I can't ever recall if I have met Sue. And, by the way, at the top of this, Mr. Speaker--I don't know if you can see it--is a picture of the founder, Mel Everson, and it says: In loving memory. As I recall, Sue is his daughter. I called Sue just to find out what was going on, and also to express my thanks for their willingness to be in business this long, carry on an important tradition for an important part of our town, and be an integrated part of an old Main Street that still occupies a unique part of the community where I live. We talked a little bit about what happened. And, fortunately, it wasn't the result of any type of pressure coming from outside economic forces that were beyond her control, it was simply the necessary decision that had to be made for family reasons. But, nonetheless, I felt a heartfelt loss. And why? Because on a deeper level, Sue's business is the loss of a symbol of community mutuality and economic affairs, a gathering place where human interaction reinforces social vibrancy. Mr. Speaker, our country needs a 21st century vision of what economic success can look like. Benign competition with a robust small business sector creates the conditions for a sustainable dynamism, a humane economy that prioritizes personal relationships and [[Page H5909]] community ties, fosters stronger entrepreneurialism, forges better consumer products, and creates more jobs for persons who need them. {time} 2000 Just as a healthy society and the principle of self-responsibility are the preconditions for prosperity, properly ordered markets support social cohesion. Markets at their best are driven by startup innovation and sustained by widespread ownership. The return of small business, with a new participatory economy, can extend the dignity and just rewards of meaningful work. It will help us fight poverty and help us to rebuild our economy in this century. Now, what are some good examples of this economic mutuality I am referring to where no person or no thing is thrown away? I recently saw a presentation by a CEO of a major corporation. He threw up a PowerPoint on the screen, and I thought we were getting ready to look at some boring quarterly earnings projections or something like that; but instead of rolling out the PowerPoints and graphs, the CEO showed a simple picture. It was a picture of a young woman on her wedding day, a bride on her father's arm. The CEO then said this: ``Everyone is someone's daughter. Everyone is someone's son.'' In other words, persons matter--persons matter in a society; persons matter in a business; persons matter as we debate the great public policy issues before us because, ultimately, that is the purpose, the well-being of persons. The point was powerfully made. The understanding of work and the workplace--the proper understanding of work as nested within the workplace--are essential to human dignity and to human happiness; and this CEO of a very large corporation said he believed business could be the greatest force for good in the world. That is a strong and proper perspective. Mr. Speaker, as I was recently looking around my garage, looking to clean out a few things, I came upon an old, antiquated pickax. It is really a substantial piece of hardware. I bought this years ago and used it numbers of times in my yard. Then the handle finally broke, and I had a hard time throwing it away--it is a bad habit I have, I guess. But it sat there in my garage, a substantial piece of iron. So, instead of throwing it away, I took it with me to the local hardware store, and then I went to look at some new ones. I asked the clerk: ``What do you think? Do you sell handles?'' He said: ``No, we do not sell new handles.'' He said: ``You are probably better off buying a new one and putting this one on the wall in the man cave.'' So I went and looked at a new one and toyed with the idea; but then the clerk said: ``Well, look. Let me do a little research for you, and I will get back to you.'' So he did. He went out and found a company in America that made pickax handles out of hickory. He took it a little further. He went ahead and ordered the handle for me, and he replaced it himself. When I went to the store about week later, there it was--a piece of old, old hardware, ready to be put back to work with a replacement handle proudly made in America and made of hickory. If you had done a straight analysis of the cost involved in this repair project, it was not worth it. I only saved about $10 by repairing versus buying a new one. I had to wait a week or so, and I had to go to the store twice, but there are unmeasured benefits here. Let's talk about those. First of all, an old piece of iron is not in a landfill; a renewable resource of hickory wood was deployed; an American company made a little profit; and the hardware store's clerk had the satisfaction of a hand-built opportunity. I will tell you, I must say, I am pretty proud of my refreshed, repurposed pickax, and I put it right to work on some old bushes I had in the yard. More importantly, Mr. Speaker, if we are going to rebuild our economy, thinking about how we manufacture, how we maintain, and how we rebuild what is still useful can unlock the benefits of a well- functioning market system. This small act of taking something old but solid and getting it back into useful service provides some insights on how to better secure economic well-being. The disposable nature of so many goods as they are now manufactured, with the intended life expectancy ever more narrowed, decreases costs in the short term--but cheaper isn't always best. The ability to repair and recycle and to repurpose--to keep the useful life of a resource as long as possible-- is smart economics. It is a fundamental principle of conservation, and it is a key to reviving the small business service sector. Perhaps, Mr. Speaker, this is an emerging trend. I was watching the Olympics. During it, I noticed a commercial in which a major retailer gave a subtle message about cheap imports. During the commercial, as the song ``Dream On'' built up steadily in the background, the commercial featured people waking up, going about the routine of life, getting their kids to school, and making their way to a factory, where they used their hands to make things--tough and gritty work, but connected to a deeper meaning. At the end of the commercial, the company stated it will invest $250 billion in American manufacturing in the years to come. Maybe we are on the front end of a trend, Mr. Speaker. I certainly hope so. An economic model that chases more and more output alone is not a valid measure of value. Our country's economic reboot requires a return to a humane economy--one focused on quality, durability, and the work of human hands and, as much as we can, made in America. Without this focus, we will forever chase that which we cannot find, and perhaps more and more people are realizing that we should shift to what is dependable, not disposable; to what is fixable, not forgettable; to what is reparable and not just replaceable. Using my repurposed hickory-handled, American-made pickax gives me a great deal of time to think about these things, Mr. Speaker. It also gives me a pretty good workout--a winner all the way around. Mr. Speaker, I want to reference something else that I happened to see. There is a show--I am not sure if it is still on--that is called ``Undercover Boss,'' and I have seen it a few times. I find the program to be quite engaging and very, very human. The premise of the show is that the CEO, the chief executive officer, of a major company goes undercover as an employee. Then, from there, he participates in the gritty work of building things, of cleaning up, of working the phones, and of performing basic administrative tasks. During this particular episode that I saw, the boss spent some time out in the field, repairing a broken sewer line. Then he was in an office, answering calls, and was at a manufacturing plant where the equipment was crafted. The CEO was assigned to one of the company's top welders for training at the manufacturing facility. As part of his disguise, he wore safety glasses and a do-rag. The first mistake that the CEO made was that of burning a hole through the metal that he was supposed to be joining. After the welder who was supervising him gently corrected his technique, they took a break, and the conversation turned to job security. The middle-aged welder, who was a long-time, dedicated employee and a team leader at that corporation, told the boss about the worry that he has and that he overhears at the manufacturing plant. Would they just show up one day and see a ``closed'' sign hanging on the cyclone fence? Given what is going on in America, no one knows for sure whether the company would just pack up and move overseas like so many others have. The simple conversation in the break room in middle America captured what so many Americans are justifiably concerned about. Although the government's aggregate statistics show an overall unemployment rate of about 5 percent, the numbers hide a disturbing reality. For too many people, the rhetoric of free markets has not translated into better opportunity or security. As I mentioned, stagnant wages and downward mobility, staggering student loan debt, job insecurity, and the increased cost of living are all real difficulties marking the new normal for an increasing number of families in our society. In another segment of the television show, the disguised CEO had to work on a home drainage system. The elderly woman who lived in the well-kept [[Page H5910]] but very simple house was told that the bill to fix the problem was $1,200. She responded in a very worried voice about her many doctor bills and about how much medicine she had to buy. The employee who was supervising the CEO then paused, considered the situation, and gently spoke back to the elderly woman and said to her: ``Well, how about $500?'' The employee, as it turns out, had taken it upon himself to cut his own commission in order to help this elderly, vulnerable person, all while his undercover boss watched. After several other meaningful encounters with his employees, the show concluded with the CEO's revealing his true identity and commending everyone with whom he had interacted. He made some poignant points about his experiences--how deeply they had touched his life and how they would now impact his management style. To the welder, he said: ``I want you to take the message back: `We are staying in America.' Give them that assurance from me.'' To the man who reduced the bill at the cost of his own salary, he rewarded him for his compassion and dedication. Business can be a force for great good, Mr. Speaker. The true potential of companies depends upon their people for their greatness. In this case, the CEO was willing to do a self-evaluation of his own leadership style and of the very fundamental purpose of the company, itself. Perhaps a scorecard should be kept to feature businesses that do the right thing: trying to keep the best jobs in America, consistently innovating, and paying just salaries to persons who work hard to support themselves and their families. In order to discover--to discover, perhaps, something about himself, to discover the true meaning of work, to discover the true value of the persons under his authority--the CEO went undercover. By doing so, he found what he had not seen: a properly functioning market economy that genuinely works for both profits and persons, repairing fractures in our society, and enhancing community interdependency. That is the point, Mr. Speaker: community interdependency is the true source of our Nation's strength. When I was a much younger man, I owned a rear-wheel drive Ford Bronco II. They don't make them anymore. I loved that little truck. I sold it shortly after I was married. That little truck was great for that time in my life, but navigating winter conditions could be a bit tough. One night, while traveling on an interstate during really forboding weather, I came over the crest of a hill, and what lay before me was surreal. It must have happened just seconds before. A large 18-wheeler truck had jackknifed. Cars were spun in every direction, flung into the median. There was a clear sheet of ice that no one had expected. {time} 2015 In an instant, my reality changed. In an instant, everything changed. I had to make a choice. I rapidly decreased my speed, gripped the wheel, and focused my total attention on the road before me only just barely navigating the treachery. Mr. Speaker, many Americans feel that they have been tossed around in a bewildering unpredictability of our current policy, economic, and political dynamics. Many Americans are looking for new leadership that offers a compelling, inspirational, and stable vision that can restore the true security of our Nation. If we so choose, one of the strengths of the American system of government is its capacity for constant replenishment. In the midst of an unpredictable government transition season, it may sound a bit peculiar to speak of opportunity. But could this moment give us the chance, as a people, to reassess and realign? Perhaps so, if we so choose. As we began this conversation, Mr. Speaker, I talked about pointing to the problems in order to understand solutions. I think a stronger America might be glimpsed through four mutually supporting principles: government decentralization, economic patriotism, foreign policy realism, and social conservation. Mr. Speaker, just like every football game has four quarters, let's think of our solutions as our four-quarter game plan: government decentralization, economic patriotism, foreign policy realism, and social conservation. What do I mean? First, a return to a more decentralized form of government will restore an important source of America's strength. I, in no way, wish to belittle the essential important debates that occur in this body and elsewhere in the Federal Government. We have a role. We have a role to create the conditions so that the rest of society can flourish. The ultimate role we have is to seek justice and the just structures that can bring about order for persons and communities to flourish. When the Federal Government grows beyond its effectiveness, it infringes upon basic liberties, it stifles innovation, it crushes creativity, and it also takes away the responsibility that we have for one another. A creeping tendency to nationalize every conceivable type of problem erodes community resolve. Now, while the Federal Government does have a central role in maintaining the guardrails for stability, the rule of law, and a fair opportunity economy, America's governing system is designed to operate most effectively at different levels. Those close to an opportunity or a problem ought to have the first authority to seize the opportunity or solve the problem. I find it notable that the veterans memorial ceremony that I went to just yesterday did not include any government funds. It was made up of community resolve and community sacrifice. As a quick civics lesson, as an aside, the Rules Committee on which the gentleman from Georgia sits is still working tonight, trying to craft the structure for the debate that will occur on certain pieces of legislation to come before us in short order. Let me return to something I said, Mr. Speaker. Just like every football game has four quarters, I believe we ought to think of our solutions as a four-quarter game plan. The first is returning to a healthy concept of decentralized government, a healthy Federalism where those closest to a responsibility or opportunity have first-order priority in taking responsibility or seizing that opportunity, again, not to denigrate the very essential role that the Federal Government plays in creating the conditions for stability and rule of law and a just playing field, particularly in the economy, as well as national security, but other levels of governance are essential to community well-being. Second, economic inclusion or economic patriotism should help America recover from an arthritic economy. As I mentioned earlier, although the government's aggregate statistics show an overall unemployment rate at about 5 percent, these numbers continue to hide certain realities. There are stagnant wages and downward mobility making life very difficult for a number of families. Mr. Speaker, it is sad to say this, but this Washington-Wall Street axis, which promotes the transnational corporation as the new ruling entity for society, cannot secure the well-being of our economy. They cannot. Instead of a globalized supply-side elitism, America needs a vibrant marketplace of her own that expands the space for constructive interdependency and community dynamism which will fight poverty and drive innovation, at the heart of which, again, is small business. Small business is the key, along with a fair regulatory environment and the right type of healthcare reform that will actually end up decreasing cost, while protecting vulnerable persons and reset the architecture so that we have a 21st century healthcare system that is truly just, that is fair, that is actually going to achieve the conditions for creativity and innovation in the marketplace. What we have now is a healthcare system that is an increasing drag on the small business sector; and, therefore, the number of jobs that we see created are going down. We are living in an entrepreneurial winter--the number of jobs being created are less from small businesses, are less than the number of small businesses that are actually dying. We are in an entrepreneurial winter. This has never happened before in the history of our country. So, focusing on the small business sector and returning to, again, a fair regulatory environment and appropriately addressing a new architecture for health care, which doesn't simply shift costs but, at its heart, protects vulnerable persons, improves [[Page H5911]] healthcare outcomes and reduces cost is a key to restoring the small business sector. Third key is foreign policy realism. What do I mean? Foreign policy realism charts a course between overinterventionalism and isolationism. America has an important role to play on the global stage today. However, many Americans are alarmed at an exhausted, drifting, and often counterproductive foreign policy. The posture of foreign policy adventurism, sometimes coupled with naive assumptions about democracy promotion, requires a recalibration. Leveraging American strength through strategic international relationships and authentic friendships will help us navigate the 21st century marked by a changing geopolitical framework. Mr. Speaker, I believe in the three Ds: strong defense, smart diplomacy, sustainable development. That is the right balance in our foreign policy considerations. Fourth key is social conservation. Social conservation provides the conditions for order, opportunity, and happiness. We usually don't put those together, social and conservation. We think of conservation as the important protection of our land and water and the air we breathe, not throwing things away unnecessarily. Thinking of the ideals of the ecosystem where all things are interdependent, or looking out into the vast horizons of nature and letting it pull ourselves to a higher realm of that which is beautiful, even that which is divine, we have all had that experience. We know it in nature. We see it. Could we possibly see the idea of an ecosystem of community where we actually think that it is more than politics for the promotion of sustainable values? As society has become more fragmented, it is harder and harder for us to craft policies that meet society's needs. Washington cannot spend enough fast enough to fix the deep wounds in our culture, Mr. Speaker. Social conservation recognizes that family life, faith life, and civic life provide a continuity of tradition, giving meaning to life and creating stability, particularly for children. Those of us who have had the scarring experience of coming from broken situations, we know this intuitively. Those of us who struggled with the deep scars of having what you know and what keeps you safe torn from you, we know that the formative institutions that preserve the good are invaluable to opportunities later in life. Our sense of well-being, the strength of our Nation ultimately does depend upon the strength of the formative institutions that give rise to family life, faith life, and civic life. That is the strength of America. We are confronting intensifying struggles about the direction of our country, and the fault lines are, sadly, widened. I think there are things that still bind us. I would like to think that what I am saying speaks to every Member of Congress here, that it transcends the superficial political boundaries that we set up that are, yes, based upon the different philosophical perspectives on the nature of what Washington ought to be and not. But I would like to think, again, that this rises above, because they are binding elements of the human heart. It is what we all long for: to be nested, to be secure within a community of loving persons around us who care enough to hold us accountable, who care enough to demand that we take responsibility for them and with them. Although we are encountering rough weather in our country, we can choose to rediscover this best sense of ourselves. We can choose to rediscover commonsense governance, which will uphold these ideals and be built upon them. We can choose right-sized economic models. We can choose to rediscover universal foundational values that are consistent with the desire of all persons' hearts. This is how the greatness can be restored again. This is how we make America great again. This is how we find ourselves and find one another and find a vision that binds us together and makes us all proud to stand as America's flag is flown. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",package_114_204.csv,31871,31871,31943,"[congressional record volume 162, number 145 (monday, september 26, 2016)] [house] [pages h5907-h5911] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 1945 america has not forgotten you the speaker pro tempore. under the speaker's announced policy of january 6, 2015, the gentleman from nebraska (mr. fortenberry) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. mr. fortenberry. mr. speaker, a friend of mine works part time in a hardware store. he is retired from several other careers, but he continues to enjoy helping people in a retail-service environment. recently, he kindly gave me, as we were talking about gardening, some hosta plants that he had grown. as i drove through his neighborhood looking for his house, i suspected his home was the one flying the large american flag. i knew that mike, my friend, had served in vietnam, but, as we spent some time digging up the plants and visiting around his garden, i learned a lot more about his harrowing experience as a marine. you see, mr. speaker, mike's squad was assigned to protect an area in the northern part of south vietnam. they were a pesky bunch, as mike put it, and the north vietnamese grew tired of the constant haranguing, so they launched a counterassault. mike's squad was outnumbered 10 to 1, and they were hit pretty hard. a call went out for help, but the first helicopter to arrive was blown apart. mike sustained severe wounds. a bullet to the chest collapsed his lung, shrapnel tore through a foot and a leg, and another bullet grazed his head. to breathe, mike had to keep clearing his throat with his finger to remove the gurgling blood. and at the point where he could no longer physically fight, he crawled to a slightly more secure place and propped himself up on a sack. mike told me he remembered two things-- the wind blowing through his hair and his mother. who would tell her that he had died? only three americans survived that battle. fortunately, another helicopter quickly landed and a corpsman came to mike's rescue, stabilized him, and helped return him to safety. a doctor performed quick and precision surgery, and the medical personnel nursed him back to health, for which mike was always grateful. but something always nagged him. he never got a chance to thank the corpsman who risked his own life to save him. and, finally, in 2001, he went online, did some research, and found the man 30 years later. mike wrote to him and said: i have not forgotten you. [[page h5908]] now, mr. speaker, it is no secret that our country's economic, political, and cultural settlement is straining under a number of very harsh realities. concentration of economic and political power, coupled with signs of social collapse, are contributing to a growing sense of vulnerability and anxiety in our society. amid a divisive and disorienting political season, terrorist attacks in san bernardino, orlando, minnesota, and new york have reminded us of the grave threats to life and our cherished liberties. take a moment, mr. speaker, to notice how many nebraskans and how many americans like mike fly our flag. it means something. the flag stands for an ideal, for a value, for the proposition that all persons have dignity. and when that dignity is safeguarded, a people can flourish. that is america. but i think more people need to hear, mr. speaker, that we have not forgotten you. the fundamental questions right now before us are, who are we as a nation, where are we going as a people, and how will we find our greatness again? yesterday, mr. speaker, i had an extraordinary privilege. i would like to share the story with you and the body. i was invited to attend the dedication of a new veterans memorial in a small town in the heart of the great plains north of lincoln, nebraska, where i live. this town is called wahoo. it was actually made famous because in the old david letterman show he named it as the hometown office. but wahoo is more than a late night show's joke. it is a place where a community lives, works, and has a deep sense of interconnectedness and well-being. it is a place of extraordinary greatness. in this small town, about 500 people from the entire county came and gathered right there at the courthouse for the dedication of a new memorial honoring the 101 servicemembers who had been killed from the small farming community and the surrounding area--soldiers, troops, military personnel from world war i to our present day. all of their names were read in an honor roll, many having czech and german names, who were such an important part of the original settlement of that area, as well as the swedish. when i approached the microphone to say a few words, i recalled the old movie ``to kill a mockingbird,'' based upon the old novel. mr. speaker, as you will recall, in that movie, the lawyer atticus finch gives a defense of a man who is unjustly accused of a crime. the community from which that man had come had to sit in the upper balcony of the courtroom because of the prejudice of that time. and as atticus finch was getting ready to leave the courtroom, the reverend, who was in the midst of that community in the gallery, says to his young child, the lawyer's young child: ``stand up, your father's passing.'' at that beautiful ceremony right there in the great plains, it started with the public high school choir and the catholic high school choir singing our national anthem. when that occurred, no one sat on a bench, no one took a knee. we all stood because it was not about us, it was about them, the men and women before us, living and dead, who had answered the call to service. and whether they had cooked or cleaned or computed or were in the worst conceivable firefight, nonetheless, they said: yes, i will serve, i will sacrifice, for the meaning of our nation. we live in a time, mr. speaker, when our world is screaming for meaning. what we are really searching for is not an answer that can be found here in this body. we have an important role to debate the most pressing issues of the day, whether those are national security, economic security, and even cultural security. the most important answers aren't found necessarily down the street in the white house. they are not going to be answered necessarily in the great debate that is about to occur moments from now on the television. the answer is found in the debate about meaning itself. when we find things that bind us, like this extraordinary ceremony yesterday nestled in the heart of america, where people young and old came to honor our veterans, when we look back to those who came before us, giving them their due in a memorial that appropriately honors them, we bind ourselves in a noble idea that sacrifice for one another, sacrifice, even for a nation, is sometimes not only necessary, but it is worthy of the fullness of the call in the human heart. but we still have hard questions before us. so what should we do? the first pathway, mr. speaker, to finding solutions is to adequately identify the problem. and in one word, i believe the problem is fragmentation. what do i mean by that? it is a creeping separateness, whether in economic affairs, government affairs, foreign affairs, or our own basic exchanges in local community life. people are feeling alone, isolated. in many cases, they feel like they lack control over the most basic things, the simple things in their own life. far remote systems seem to be the new governing order. informative institutions that used to provide the continuity of tradition and nest people into an ongoing desire and pathway toward hope by giving them the gifts of that tradition and the responsibility nested within community, as well as the accountability, have all become fragmented. these burdens press upon our people in a most profound way, and, in particular, in regards to their own economic well-being. these days, economic measures are on everyone's mind. there is a tremendous amount of anxiety, even hopelessness, in our uncertain times. and while the stock market has certainly rebounded and corporate profits have soured, many families are facing downward mobility, stagnant wages, decreased opportunity, the feeling of disenfranchisement, and the inability to achieve financial security. part of our problem is our country's damaged micro-enterprise sector, that entrepreneurial space where most new jobs in the country are actually created. and we are not even talking about corporations that are 100 to 500 employees. we are talking about shops that are 1 to 5 people. this morning, i made a phone call as i was getting on the plane to return here from nebraska because, mr. speaker, i received this in the mail. this is a flyer announcing a doors-closing sale from a small business called havelock furniture. this furniture company anchors the north end of a little community called havelock, which is now subsumed into the greater community of lincoln, nebraska. it distressed me when i received this. at first, i thought they might be another victim of corporate consolidation, an inability to compete as a small furniture store in a sector that might be, again, increasing the concentration into fewer and fewer hands. so i just picked up the phone, and i called sue. now, this is an advertisement for a closing-business sale, and it is giving me a discount if i want to come there and buy something. but sue lays out, in very heartfelt terms, the reality of their circumstances: the family has been in business for 61 years, and now i am retiring forever. she goes on to say: and i am offering our friends and employees and preferred customers a special discount. well, i can't ever recall if i have met sue. and, by the way, at the top of this, mr. speaker--i don't know if you can see it--is a picture of the founder, mel everson, and it says: in loving memory. as i recall, sue is his daughter. i called sue just to find out what was going on, and also to express my thanks for their willingness to be in business this long, carry on an important tradition for an important part of our town, and be an integrated part of an old main street that still occupies a unique part of the community where i live. we talked a little bit about what happened. and, fortunately, it wasn't the result of any type of pressure coming from outside economic forces that were beyond her control, it was simply the necessary decision that had to be made for family reasons. but, nonetheless, i felt a heartfelt loss. and why? because on a deeper level, sue's business is the loss of a symbol of community mutuality and economic affairs, a gathering place where human interaction reinforces social vibrancy. mr. speaker, our country needs a 21st century vision of what economic success can look like. benign competition with a robust small business sector creates the conditions for a sustainable dynamism, a humane economy that prioritizes personal relationships and [[page h5909]] community ties, fosters stronger entrepreneurialism, forges better consumer products, and creates more jobs for persons who need them. {time} 2000 just as a healthy society and the principle of self-responsibility are the preconditions for prosperity, properly ordered markets support social cohesion. markets at their best are driven by startup innovation and sustained by widespread ownership. the return of small business, with a new participatory economy, can extend the dignity and just rewards of meaningful work. it will help us fight poverty and help us to rebuild our economy in this century. now, what are some good examples of this economic mutuality i am referring to where no person or no thing is thrown away? i recently saw a presentation by a ceo of a major corporation. he threw up a powerpoint on the screen, and i thought we were getting ready to look at some boring quarterly earnings projections or something like that; but instead of rolling out the powerpoints and graphs, the ceo showed a simple picture. it was a picture of a young woman on her wedding day, a bride on her father's arm. the ceo then said this: ``everyone is someone's daughter. everyone is someone's son.'' in other words, persons matter--persons matter in a society; persons matter in a business; persons matter as we debate the great public policy issues before us because, ultimately, that is the purpose, the well-being of persons. the point was powerfully made. the understanding of work and the workplace--the proper understanding of work as nested within the workplace--are essential to human dignity and to human happiness; and this ceo of a very large corporation said he believed business could be the greatest force for good in the world. that is a strong and proper perspective. mr. speaker, as i was recently looking around my garage, looking to clean out a few things, i came upon an old, antiquated pickax. it is really a substantial piece of hardware. i bought this years ago and used it numbers of times in my yard. then the handle finally broke, and i had a hard time throwing it away--it is a bad habit i have, i guess. but it sat there in my garage, a substantial piece of iron. so, instead of throwing it away, i took it with me to the local hardware store, and then i went to look at some new ones. i asked the clerk: ``what do you think? do you sell handles?'' he said: ``no, we do not sell new handles.'' he said: ``you are probably better off buying a new one and putting this one on the wall in the man cave.'' so i went and looked at a new one and toyed with the idea; but then the clerk said: ``well, look. let me do a little research for you, and i will get back to you.'' so he did. he went out and found a company in america that made pickax handles out of hickory. he took it a little further. he went ahead and ordered the handle for me, and he replaced it himself. when i went to the store about week later, there it was--a piece of old, old hardware, ready to be put back to work with a replacement handle proudly made in america and made of hickory. if you had done a straight analysis of the cost involved in this repair project, it was not worth it. i only saved about $10 by repairing versus buying a new one. i had to wait a week or so, and i had to go to the store twice, but there are unmeasured benefits here. let's talk about those. first of all, an old piece of iron is not in a landfill; a renewable resource of hickory wood was deployed; an american company made a little profit; and the hardware store's clerk had the satisfaction of a hand-built opportunity. i will tell you, i must say, i am pretty proud of my refreshed, repurposed pickax, and i put it right to work on some old bushes i had in the yard. more importantly, mr. speaker, if we are going to rebuild our economy, thinking about how we manufacture, how we maintain, and how we rebuild what is still useful can unlock the benefits of a well- functioning market system. this small act of taking something old but solid and getting it back into useful service provides some insights on how to better secure economic well-being. the disposable nature of so many goods as they are now manufactured, with the intended life expectancy ever more narrowed, decreases costs in the short term--but cheaper isn't always best. the ability to repair and recycle and to repurpose--to keep the useful life of a resource as long as possible-- is smart economics. it is a fundamental principle of conservation, and it is a key to reviving the small business service sector. perhaps, mr. speaker, this is an emerging trend. i was watching the olympics. during it, i noticed a commercial in which a major retailer gave a subtle message about cheap imports. during the commercial, as the song ``dream on'' built up steadily in the background, the commercial featured people waking up, going about the routine of life, getting their kids to school, and making their way to a factory, where they used their hands to make things--tough and gritty work, but connected to a deeper meaning. at the end of the commercial, the company stated it will invest $250 billion in american manufacturing in the years to come. maybe we are on the front end of a trend, mr. speaker. i certainly hope so. an economic model that chases more and more output alone is not a valid measure of value. our country's economic reboot requires a return to a humane economy--one focused on quality, durability, and the work of human hands and, as much as we can, made in america. without this focus, we will forever chase that which we cannot find, and perhaps more and more people are realizing that we should shift to what is dependable, not disposable; to what is fixable, not forgettable; to what is reparable and not just replaceable. using my repurposed hickory-handled, american-made pickax gives me a great deal of time to think about these things, mr. speaker. it also gives me a pretty good workout--a winner all the way around. mr. speaker, i want to reference something else that i happened to see. there is a show--i am not sure if it is still on--that is called ``undercover boss,'' and i have seen it a few times. i find the program to be quite engaging and very, very human. the premise of the show is that the ceo, the chief executive officer, of a major company goes undercover as an employee. then, from there, he participates in the gritty work of building things, of cleaning up, of working the phones, and of performing basic administrative tasks. during this particular episode that i saw, the boss spent some time out in the field, repairing a broken sewer line. then he was in an office, answering calls, and was at a manufacturing plant where the equipment was crafted. the ceo was assigned to one of the company's top welders for training at the manufacturing facility. as part of his disguise, he wore safety glasses and a do-rag. the first mistake that the ceo made was that of burning a hole through the metal that he was supposed to be joining. after the welder who was supervising him gently corrected his technique, they took a break, and the conversation turned to job security. the middle-aged welder, who was a long-time, dedicated employee and a team leader at that corporation, told the boss about the worry that he has and that he overhears at the manufacturing plant. would they just show up one day and see a ``closed'' sign hanging on the cyclone fence? given what is going on in america, no one knows for sure whether the company would just pack up and move overseas like so many others have. the simple conversation in the break room in middle america captured what so many americans are justifiably concerned about. although the government's aggregate statistics show an overall unemployment rate of about 5 percent, the numbers hide a disturbing reality. for too many people, the rhetoric of free markets has not translated into better opportunity or security. as i mentioned, stagnant wages and downward mobility, staggering student loan debt, job insecurity, and the increased cost of living are all real difficulties marking the new normal for an increasing number of families in our society. in another segment of the television show, the disguised ceo had to work on a home drainage system. the elderly woman who lived in the well-kept [[page h5910]] but very simple house was told that the bill to fix the problem was $1,200. she responded in a very worried voice about her many doctor bills and about how much medicine she had to buy. the employee who was supervising the ceo then paused, considered the situation, and gently spoke back to the elderly woman and said to her: ``well, how about $500?'' the employee, as it turns out, had taken it upon himself to cut his own commission in order to help this elderly, vulnerable person, all while his undercover boss watched. after several other meaningful encounters with his employees, the show concluded with the ceo's revealing his true identity and commending everyone with whom he had interacted. he made some poignant points about his experiences--how deeply they had touched his life and how they would now impact his management style. to the welder, he said: ``i want you to take the message back: `we are staying in america.' give them that assurance from me.'' to the man who reduced the bill at the cost of his own salary, he rewarded him for his compassion and dedication. business can be a force for great good, mr. speaker. the true potential of companies depends upon their people for their greatness. in this case, the ceo was willing to do a self-evaluation of his own leadership style and of the very fundamental purpose of the company, itself. perhaps a scorecard should be kept to feature businesses that do the right thing: trying to keep the best jobs in america, consistently innovating, and paying just salaries to persons who work hard to support themselves and their families. in order to discover--to discover, perhaps, something about himself, to discover the true meaning of work, to discover the true value of the persons under his authority--the ceo went undercover. by doing so, he found what he had not seen: a properly functioning market economy that genuinely works for both profits and persons, repairing fractures in our society, and enhancing community interdependency. that is the point, mr. speaker: community interdependency is the true source of our nation's strength. when i was a much younger man, i owned a rear-wheel drive ford bronco ii. they don't make them anymore. i loved that little truck. i sold it shortly after i was married. that little truck was great for that time in my life, but navigating winter conditions could be a bit tough. one night, while traveling on an interstate during really forboding weather, i came over the crest of a hill, and what lay before me was surreal. it must have happened just seconds before. a large 18-wheeler truck had jackknifed. cars were spun in every direction, flung into the median. there was a clear sheet of ice that no one had expected. {time} 2015 in an instant, my reality changed. in an instant, everything changed. i had to make a choice. i rapidly decreased my speed, gripped the wheel, and focused my total attention on the road before me only just barely navigating the treachery. mr. speaker, many americans feel that they have been tossed around in a bewildering unpredictability of our current policy, economic, and political dynamics. many americans are looking for new leadership that offers a compelling, inspirational, and stable vision that can restore the true security of our nation. if we so choose, one of the strengths of the american system of government is its capacity for constant replenishment. in the midst of an unpredictable government transition season, it may sound a bit peculiar to speak of opportunity. but could this moment give us the chance, as a people, to reassess and realign? perhaps so, if we so choose. as we began this conversation, mr. speaker, i talked about pointing to the problems in order to understand solutions. i think a stronger america might be glimpsed through four mutually supporting principles: government decentralization, economic patriotism, foreign policy realism, and social conservation. mr. speaker, just like every football game has four quarters, let's think of our solutions as our four-quarter game plan: government decentralization, economic patriotism, foreign policy realism, and social conservation. what do i mean? first, a return to a more decentralized form of government will restore an important source of america's strength. i, in no way, wish to belittle the essential important debates that occur in this body and elsewhere in the federal government. we have a role. we have a role to create the conditions so that the rest of society can flourish. the ultimate role we have is to seek justice and the just structures that can bring about order for persons and communities to flourish. when the federal government grows beyond its effectiveness, it infringes upon basic liberties, it stifles innovation, it crushes creativity, and it also takes away the responsibility that we have for one another. a creeping tendency to nationalize every conceivable type of problem erodes community resolve. now, while the federal government does have a central role in maintaining the guardrails for stability, the rule of law, and a fair opportunity economy, america's governing system is designed to operate most effectively at different levels. those close to an opportunity or a problem ought to have the first authority to seize the opportunity or solve the problem. i find it notable that the veterans memorial ceremony that i went to just yesterday did not include any government funds. it was made up of community resolve and community sacrifice. as a quick civics lesson, as an aside, the rules committee on which the gentleman from georgia sits is still working tonight, trying to craft the structure for the debate that will occur on certain pieces of legislation to come before us in short order. let me return to something i said, mr. speaker. just like every football game has four quarters, i believe we ought to think of our solutions as a four-quarter game plan. the first is returning to a healthy concept of decentralized government, a healthy federalism where those closest to a responsibility or opportunity have first-order priority in taking responsibility or seizing that opportunity, again, not to denigrate the very essential role that the federal government plays in creating the conditions for stability and rule of law and a just playing field, particularly in the economy, as well as national security, but other levels of governance are essential to community well-being. second, economic inclusion or economic patriotism should help america recover from an arthritic economy. as i mentioned earlier, although the government's aggregate statistics show an overall unemployment rate at about 5 percent, these numbers continue to hide certain realities. there are stagnant wages and downward mobility making life very difficult for a number of families. mr. speaker, it is sad to say this, but this washington-wall street axis, which promotes the transnational corporation as the new ruling entity for society, cannot secure the well-being of our economy. they cannot. instead of a globalized supply-side elitism, america needs a vibrant marketplace of her own that expands the space for constructive interdependency and community dynamism which will fight poverty and drive innovation, at the heart of which, again, is small business. small business is the key, along with a fair regulatory environment and the right type of healthcare reform that will actually end up decreasing cost, while protecting vulnerable persons and reset the architecture so that we have a 21st century healthcare system that is truly just, that is fair, that is actually going to achieve the conditions for creativity and innovation in the marketplace. what we have now is a healthcare system that is an increasing drag on the small business sector; and, therefore, the number of jobs that we see created are going down. we are living in an entrepreneurial winter--the number of jobs being created are less from small businesses, are less than the number of small businesses that are actually dying. we are in an entrepreneurial winter. this has never happened before in the history of our country. so, focusing on the small business sector and returning to, again, a fair regulatory environment and appropriately addressing a new architecture for health care, which doesn't simply shift costs but, at its heart, protects vulnerable persons, improves [[page h5911]] healthcare outcomes and reduces cost is a key to restoring the small business sector. third key is foreign policy realism. what do i mean? foreign policy realism charts a course between overinterventionalism and isolationism. america has an important role to play on the global stage today. however, many americans are alarmed at an exhausted, drifting, and often counterproductive foreign policy. the posture of foreign policy adventurism, sometimes coupled with naive assumptions about democracy promotion, requires a recalibration. leveraging american strength through strategic international relationships and authentic friendships will help us navigate the 21st century marked by a changing geopolitical framework. mr. speaker, i believe in the three ds: strong defense, smart diplomacy, sustainable development. that is the right balance in our foreign policy considerations. fourth key is social conservation. social conservation provides the conditions for order, opportunity, and happiness. we usually don't put those together, social and conservation. we think of conservation as the important protection of our land and water and the air we breathe, not throwing things away unnecessarily. thinking of the ideals of the ecosystem where all things are interdependent, or looking out into the vast horizons of nature and letting it pull ourselves to a higher realm of that which is beautiful, even that which is divine, we have all had that experience. we know it in nature. we see it. could we possibly see the idea of an ecosystem of community where we actually think that it is more than politics for the promotion of sustainable values? as society has become more fragmented, it is harder and harder for us to craft policies that meet society's needs. washington cannot spend enough fast enough to fix the deep wounds in our culture, mr. speaker. social conservation recognizes that family life, faith life, and civic life provide a continuity of tradition, giving meaning to life and creating stability, particularly for children. those of us who have had the scarring experience of coming from broken situations, we know this intuitively. those of us who struggled with the deep scars of having what you know and what keeps you safe torn from you, we know that the formative institutions that preserve the good are invaluable to opportunities later in life. our sense of well-being, the strength of our nation ultimately does depend upon the strength of the formative institutions that give rise to family life, faith life, and civic life. that is the strength of america. we are confronting intensifying struggles about the direction of our country, and the fault lines are, sadly, widened. i think there are things that still bind us. i would like to think that what i am saying speaks to every member of congress here, that it transcends the superficial political boundaries that we set up that are, yes, based upon the different philosophical perspectives on the nature of what washington ought to be and not. but i would like to think, again, that this rises above, because they are binding elements of the human heart. it is what we all long for: to be nested, to be secure within a community of loving persons around us who care enough to hold us accountable, who care enough to demand that we take responsibility for them and with them. although we are encountering rough weather in our country, we can choose to rediscover this best sense of ourselves. we can choose to rediscover commonsense governance, which will uphold these ideals and be built upon them. we can choose right-sized economic models. we can choose to rediscover universal foundational values that are consistent with the desire of all persons' hearts. this is how the greatness can be restored again. this is how we make america great again. this is how we find ourselves and find one another and find a vision that binds us together and makes us all proud to stand as america's flag is flown. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",31871

CREC-2016-09-26-pt1-PgS6072,CREC-2016-09-26,114,CONTINUING RESOLUTION,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6072-S6073] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONTINUING RESOLUTION Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, the 10-week clean CR the Senate will vote on tomorrow is pretty simple. It keeps the government funded at the same agreed-upon, bipartisan spending levels as today. It contains zero controversial riders, it funds the fight [[Page S6073]] against Zika, and it ensures that veterans and the victims of severe flooding and the heroin and prescription opioid crisis are not left behind. It is clean. It is fair. We should pass it. Now, it is true that some in the Democratic leadership would like to turn this simple 10-week funding bill into some unnecessary partisan food fight. They think it is good election-year politics, but they have struggled to explain how they might even justify a vote against it. They can't do it on spending levels; they already agreed to those. They can't do it on controversial riders; there are none. They can't do it on Zika; we have a bipartisan compromise there. Both Democrats and Republicans agree on the need to help vets, flood victims, and those suffering from the heroin and prescription opioid crisis. So if both parties support what is actually in the clean CR-Zika package, then just what in this bill are Democratic leaders opposed to? It turns out they are trying to take our country to the brink, not based on something that is in this bill but something that isn't, and it is something the Senate already addressed in the appropriate vehicle to do so. On September 15, the Senate voted to pass the Water Resources Development Act, which includes assistance for the families affected by lead poisoning in Flint. As Chairman Inhofe has pointed out, WRDA is not only the proper vehicle to address the situation facing Flint now, it is also the proper vehicle to help prevent water infrastructure crises in the future. The House is now prepared this week to pass WRDA as well, and Chairman Inhofe has pledged he will continue to pursue resources for Flint once the bill goes to conference. We know it is important to help the victims of recent severe flooding. Democrats are now suggesting, however, that we not provide that relief unless they get an unrelated rider in this clean CR-Zika package. Is their solution then to remove help for flood victims? If their solution is to remove help for flood victims, they should say so. So let's be clear. It would be cruel for any Senator who just voted to help Flint to now turn around and filibuster the victims of floods, the heroin and prescription opioid crisis, and Zika as part of some partisan game. Senators in both parties know this. I know our Democratic friends understand this, especially when we consider their calls to do more to address the heroin and prescription opioid crisis, and especially when we consider the letter they just wrote on Zika this month. Let me read some of what they had to say: ``Zika is now well established in the United States with cases of local transmission by mosquitoes being reported in multiple areas of Florida, as well as the U.S. territories,'' Democratic Senators wrote. It is causing ``babies [to] die, pregnant women and communities [to] suffer, [and] adults [to] worry about future long-term neurological risks from Zika. . . . `' These Senate Democrats called for immediate passage of a bipartisan Zika package because ``[t]he longer we delay, the greater the . . . irreparable human harm from Zika.'' This is what they said: ``The time for partisan games is over.'' Now, that is a letter Senate Democrats wrote just this month. The bill before us contains a compromise Zika package that both parties support. Senator Nelson, a Democrat from Florida, understands the urgency of addressing Zika, and that is why he supports this bill which, as he noted, represents a ``clean $1.1 billion to help stop the spread of the Zika virus with no political riders.'' Senator Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii, also voiced his support for the Zika compromise in this bill. Just last week, he said it is good for his State and urged that we ``move forward with providing the CDC with the resources it needs.'' Senator Nelson and Senator Schatz are just 2 Democratic Senators out of nearly 30 who penned the letter earlier this month calling for quick congressional action on Zika. I ask all of them to join us and act now. Just as we joined together to help Flint earlier this month in the appropriate vehicle, now it is time for Democrats to join with Republicans to ensure veterans and those impacted by Zika, flooding, and the heroin and prescription opioid crisis do not fall victim to a partisan filibuster. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6072-S6073] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONTINUING RESOLUTION Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, the 10-week clean CR the Senate will vote on tomorrow is pretty simple. It keeps the government funded at the same agreed-upon, bipartisan spending levels as today. It contains zero controversial riders, it funds the fight [[Page S6073]] against Zika, and it ensures that veterans and the victims of severe flooding and the heroin and prescription opioid crisis are not left behind. It is clean. It is fair. We should pass it. Now, it is true that some in the Democratic leadership would like to turn this simple 10-week funding bill into some unnecessary partisan food fight. They think it is good election-year politics, but they have struggled to explain how they might even justify a vote against it. They can't do it on spending levels; they already agreed to those. They can't do it on controversial riders; there are none. They can't do it on Zika; we have a bipartisan compromise there. Both Democrats and Republicans agree on the need to help vets, flood victims, and those suffering from the heroin and prescription opioid crisis. So if both parties support what is actually in the clean CR-Zika package, then just what in this bill are Democratic leaders opposed to? It turns out they are trying to take our country to the brink, not based on something that is in this bill but something that isn't, and it is something the Senate already addressed in the appropriate vehicle to do so. On September 15, the Senate voted to pass the Water Resources Development Act, which includes assistance for the families affected by lead poisoning in Flint. As Chairman Inhofe has pointed out, WRDA is not only the proper vehicle to address the situation facing Flint now, it is also the proper vehicle to help prevent water infrastructure crises in the future. The House is now prepared this week to pass WRDA as well, and Chairman Inhofe has pledged he will continue to pursue resources for Flint once the bill goes to conference. We know it is important to help the victims of recent severe flooding. Democrats are now suggesting, however, that we not provide that relief unless they get an unrelated rider in this clean CR-Zika package. Is their solution then to remove help for flood victims? If their solution is to remove help for flood victims, they should say so. So let's be clear. It would be cruel for any Senator who just voted to help Flint to now turn around and filibuster the victims of floods, the heroin and prescription opioid crisis, and Zika as part of some partisan game. Senators in both parties know this. I know our Democratic friends understand this, especially when we consider their calls to do more to address the heroin and prescription opioid crisis, and especially when we consider the letter they just wrote on Zika this month.

CREC-2016-09-26-pt1-PgS6071-6,CREC-2016-09-26,114,JUSTICE AGAINST SPONSORS OF TERRORISM ACT--VETO,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6071-S6072] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] JUSTICE AGAINST SPONSORS OF TERRORISM ACT--VETO Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, is there a message at the desk in reference to S. 2040? The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair lays before the Senate a communication from the Secretary of the Senate regarding that matter. The clerk will read the communication. The legislative clerk read as follows: U.S. Senate, Office of the Secretary, Washington, DC, September 26, 2016. Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr., President of the Senate, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. President: On Friday, September 23, 2016, the President of the United States sent by messenger the attached sealed envelope addressed to the President of the Senate dated September 23, 2016, said to contain a veto message on the bill S. 2040, the ``Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act.'' The Senate not being in session on the last day which the President had for the return of this bill under the provisions of the Constitution of the United States, in order to protect the interests of the Senate so that it might have the opportunity to reconsider the bill, I accepted the message at 3:45 p.m., and I now present to you the President's veto message, with the accompanying papers, for disposition by the Senate. Respectfully, Julie E. Adams, Secretary of the Senate. Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, is the veto message with the papers attached at the desk? The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. It is. Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the veto message on S. 2040 be considered as having been read; that it be printed in the Record, and spread in full upon the Journal. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The veto message ordered to be printed in the Record is as follows: To the Senate of the United States: I am returning herewith without my approval S. 2040, the ``Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act'' (JASTA), which would, among other things, remove sovereign immunity in U.S. courts from foreign governments that are not designated state sponsors of terrorism. I have deep sympathy for the families of the victims of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 (9/11), who have suffered grievously. I also have a deep appreciation of these families' desire to pursue justice and am strongly committed to assisting them in their efforts. Consistent with this commitment, over the past 8 years, I have directed my Administration to pursue relentlessly al-Qa'ida, the terrorist group that planned the 9/11 attacks. The heroic efforts of our military and counterterrorism professionals have decimated al- Qa'ida's leadership and killed Osama bin Laden. My Administration also strongly supported, and I signed into law, legislation which ensured that those who bravely responded [[Page S6072]] on that terrible day and other survivors of the attacks will be able to receive treatment for any injuries resulting from the attacks. And my Administration also directed the Intelligence Community to perform a declassification review of ``Part Four of the Joint Congressional Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities Before and After the Terrorist Attacks of September 11,'' so that the families of 9/11 victims and broader public can better understand the information investigators gathered following that dark day of our history. Notwithstanding these significant efforts, I recognize that there is nothing that could ever erase the grief the 9/11 families have endured. My Administration therefore remains resolute in its commitment to assist these families in their pursuit of justice and do whatever we can to prevent another attack in the United States. Enacting JASTA into law, however, would neither protect Americans from terrorist attacks nor improve the effectiveness of our response to such attacks. As drafted, JASTA would allow private litigation against foreign governments in U.S. courts based on allegations that such foreign governments' actions abroad made them responsible for terrorism-related injuries on U.S. soil. This legislation would permit litigation against countries that have neither been designated by the executive branch as state sponsors of terrorism nor taken direct actions in the United States to carry out an attack here. The JASTA would be detrimental to U.S. national interests more broadly, which is why I am returning it without my approval. First, JASTA threatens to reduce the effectiveness of our response to indications that a foreign government has taken steps outside our borders to provide support for terrorism, by taking such matters out of the hands of national security and foreign policy professionals and placing them in the hands of private litigants and courts. Any indication that a foreign government played a role in a terrorist attack on U.S. soil is a matter of deep concern and merits a forceful, unified Federal Government response that considers the wide range of important and effective tools available. One of these tools is designating the foreign government in question as a state sponsor of terrorism, which carries with it a litany of repercussions, including the foreign government being stripped of its sovereign immunity before U.S. courts in certain terrorism-related cases and subjected to a range of sanctions. Given these serious consequences, state sponsor of terrorism designations are made only after national security, foreign policy, and intelligence professionals carefully review all available information to determine whether a country meets the criteria that the Congress established. In contrast, JASTA departs from longstanding standards and practice under our Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and threatens to strip all foreign governments of immunity from judicial process in the United States based solely upon allegations by private litigants that a foreign government's overseas conduct had some role or connection to a group or person that carried out a terrorist attack inside the United States. This would invite consequential decisions to be made based upon incomplete information and risk having different courts reaching different conclusions about the culpability of individual foreign governments and their role in terrorist activities directed against the United States--which is neither an effective nor a coordinated way for us to respond to indications that a foreign government might have been behind a terrorist attack. Second, JASTA would upset longstanding international principles regarding sovereign immunity, putting in place rules that, if applied globally, could have serious implications for U.S. national interests. The United States has a larger international presence, by far, than any other country, and sovereign immunity principles protect our Nation and its Armed Forces, officials, and assistance professionals, from foreign court proceedings. These principles also protect U.S. Government assets from attempted seizure by private litigants abroad. Removing sovereign immunity in U.S. courts from foreign governments that are not designated as state sponsors of terrorism, based solely on allegations that such foreign governments' actions abroad had a connection to terrorism-related injuries on U.S. soil, threatens to undermine these longstanding principles that protect the United States, our forces, and our personnel. Indeed, reciprocity plays a substantial role in foreign relations, and numerous other countries already have laws that allow for the adjustment of a foreign state's immunities based on the treatment their governments receive in the courts of the other state. Enactment of JASTA could encourage foreign governments to act reciprocally and allow their domestic courts to exercise jurisdiction over the United States or U.S. officials--including our men and women in uniform--for allegedly causing injuries overseas via U.S. support to third parties. This could lead to suits against the United States or U.S. officials for actions taken by members of an armed group that received U.S. assistance, misuse of U.S. military equipment by foreign forces, or abuses committed by police units that received U.S. training, even if the allegations at issue ultimately would be without merit. And if any of these litigants were to win judgments--based on foreign domestic laws as applied by foreign courts--they would begin to look to the assets of the U.S. Government held abroad to satisfy those judgments, with potentially serious financial consequences for the United States. Third, JASTA threatens to create complications in our relationships with even our closest partners. If JASTA were enacted, courts could potentially consider even minimal allegations accusing U.S. allies or partners of complicity in a particular terrorist attack in the United States to be sufficient to open the door to litigation and wide-ranging discovery against a foreign country--for example, the country where an individual who later committed a terrorist act traveled from or became radicalized. A number of our allies and partners have already contacted us with serious concerns about the bill. By exposing these allies and partners to this sort of litigation in U.S. courts, JASTA threatens to limit their cooperation on key national security issues, including counterterrorism initiatives, at a crucial time when we are trying to build coalitions, not create divisions. The 9/11 attacks were the worst act of terrorism on U.S. soil, and they were met with an unprecedented U.S. Government response. The United States has taken robust and wide-ranging actions to provide justice for the victims of the 9/11 attacks and keep Americans safe, from providing financial compensation for victims and their families to conducting worldwide counterterrorism programs to bringing criminal charges against culpable individuals. I have continued and expanded upon these efforts, both to help victims of terrorism gain justice for the loss and suffering of their loved ones and to protect the United States from future attacks. The JASTA, however, does not contribute to these goals, does not enhance the safety of Americans from terrorist attacks, and undermines core U.S. interests. For these reasons, I must veto the bill. Barack Obama. The White House, September 23, 2016. Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, the veto message be held at the desk, and at a time to be determined by the majority leader in consultation with the Democratic leader on Wednesday, September 28, the Senate proceed to the veto message on S. 2040; that there be 2 hours of debate, divided between the leaders or their designees; that upon the use or yielding back of that time, the Senate vote on passage of the bill, the objections of the President to the contrary notwithstanding, with no intervening action or debate. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6071-S6072] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] JUSTICE AGAINST SPONSORS OF TERRORISM ACT--VETO Mr. McCONNELL.

Barack Obama. The White House, September 23, 2016. Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, the veto message be held at the desk, and at a time to be determined by the majority leader in consultation with the Democratic leader on Wednesday, September 28, the Senate proceed to the veto message on S. 2040; that there be 2 hours of debate, divided between the leaders or their designees; that upon the use or yielding back of that time, the Senate vote on passage of the bill, the objections of the President to the contrary notwithstanding, with no intervening action or debate. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6071-S6072] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] JUSTICE AGAINST SPONSORS OF TERRORISM ACT--VETO Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, is there a message at the desk in reference to S. 2040? The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair lays before the Senate a communication from the Secretary of the Senate regarding that matter. The clerk will read the communication. The legislative clerk read as follows: U.S. Senate, Office of the Secretary, Washington, DC, September 26, 2016. Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr., President of the Senate, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. President: On Friday, September 23, 2016, the President of the United States sent by messenger the attached sealed envelope addressed to the President of the Senate dated September 23, 2016, said to contain a veto message on the bill S. 2040, the ``Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act.'' The Senate not being in session on the last day which the President had for the return of this bill under the provisions of the Constitution of the United States, in order to protect the interests of the Senate so that it might have the opportunity to reconsider the bill, I accepted the message at 3:45 p.m., and I now present to you the President's veto message, with the accompanying papers, for disposition by the Senate. Respectfully, Julie E. Adams, Secretary of the Senate. Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, is the veto message with the papers attached at the desk? The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. It is. Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the veto message on S. 2040 be considered as having been read; that it be printed in the Record, and spread in full upon the Journal. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The veto message ordered to be printed in the Record is as follows: To the Senate of the United States: I am returning herewith without my approval S. 2040, the ``Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act'' (JASTA), which would, among other things, remove sovereign immunity in U.S. courts from foreign governments that are not designated state sponsors of terrorism. I have deep sympathy for the families of the victims of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 (9/11), who have suffered grievously. I also have a deep appreciation of these families' desire to pursue justice and am strongly committed to assisting them in their efforts. Consistent with this commitment, over the past 8 years, I have directed my Administration to pursue relentlessly al-Qa'ida, the terrorist group that planned the 9/11 attacks. The heroic efforts of our military and counterterrorism professionals have decimated al- Qa'ida's leadership and killed Osama bin Laden. My Administration also strongly supported, and I signed into law, legislation which ensured that those who bravely responded [[Page S6072]] on that terrible day and other survivors of the attacks will be able to receive treatment for any injuries resulting from the attacks. And my Administration also directed the Intelligence Community to perform a declassification review of ``Part Four of the Joint Congressional Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities Before and After the Terrorist Attacks of September 11,'' so that the families of 9/11 victims and broader public can better understand the information investigators gathered following that dark day of our history. Notwithstanding these significant efforts, I recognize that there is nothing that could ever erase the grief the 9/11 families have endured. My Administration therefore remains resolute in its commitment to assist these families in their pursuit of justice and do whatever we can to prevent another attack in the United States. Enacting JASTA into law, however, would neither protect Americans from terrorist attacks nor improve the effectiveness of our response to such attacks. As drafted, JASTA would allow private litigation against foreign governments in U.S. courts based on allegations that such foreign governments' actions abroad made them responsible for terrorism-related injuries on U.S. soil. This legislation would permit litigation against countries that have neither been designated by the executive branch as state sponsors of terrorism nor taken direct actions in the United States to carry out an attack here. The JASTA would be detrimental to U.S. national interests more broadly, which is why I am returning it without my approval. First, JASTA threatens to reduce the effectiveness of our response to indications that a foreign government has taken steps outside our borders to provide support for terrorism, by taking such matters out of the hands of national security and foreign policy professionals and placing them in the hands of private litigants and courts. Any indication that a foreign government played a role in a terrorist attack on U.S. soil is a matter of deep concern and merits a forceful, unified Federal Government response that considers the wide range of important and effective tools available. One of these tools is designating the foreign government in question as a state sponsor of terrorism, which carries with it a litany of repercussions, including the foreign government being stripped of its sovereign immunity before U.S. courts in certain terrorism-related cases and subjected to a range of sanctions. Given these serious consequences, state sponsor of terrorism designations are made only after national security, foreign policy, and intelligence professionals carefully review all available information to determine whether a country meets the criteria that the Congress established. In contrast, JASTA departs from longstanding standards and practice under our Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and threatens to strip all foreign governments of immunity from judicial process in the United States based solely upon allegations by private litigants that a foreign government's overseas conduct had some role or connection to a group or person that carried out a terrorist attack inside the United States. This would invite consequential decisions to be made based upon incomplete information and risk having different courts reaching different conclusions about the culpability of individual foreign governments and their role in terrorist activities directed against the United States--which is neither an effective nor a coordinated way for us to respond to indications that a foreign government might have been behind a terrorist attack. Second, JASTA would upset longstanding international principles regarding sovereign immunity, putting in place rules that, if applied globally, could have serious implications for U.S. national interests. The United States has a larger international presence, by far, than any other country, and sovereign immunity principles protect our Nation and its Armed Forces, officials, and assistance professionals, from foreign court proceedings. These principles also protect U.S. Government assets from attempted seizure by private litigants abroad. Removing sovereign immunity in U.S. courts from foreign governments that are not designated as state sponsors of terrorism, based solely on allegations that such foreign governments' actions abroad had a connection to terrorism-related injuries on U.S. soil, threatens to undermine these longstanding principles that protect the United States, our forces, and our personnel. Indeed, reciprocity plays a substantial role in foreign relations, and numerous other countries already have laws that allow for the adjustment of a foreign state's immunities based on the treatment their governments receive in the courts of the other state. Enactment of JASTA could encourage foreign governments to act reciprocally and allow their domestic courts to exercise jurisdiction over the United States or U.S. officials--including our men and women in uniform--for allegedly causing injuries overseas via U.S. support to third parties. This could lead to suits against the United States or U.S. officials for actions taken by members of an armed group that received U.S. assistance, misuse of U.S. military equipment by foreign forces, or abuses committed by police units that received U.S. training, even if the allegations at issue ultimately would be without merit. And if any of these litigants were to win judgments--based on foreign domestic laws as applied by foreign courts--they would begin to look to the assets of the U.S. Government held abroad to satisfy those judgments, with potentially serious financial consequences for the United States. Third, JASTA threatens to create complications in our relationships with even our closest partners. If JASTA were enacted, courts could potentially consider even minimal allegations accusing U.S. allies or partners of complicity in a particular terrorist attack in the United States to be sufficient to open the door to litigation and wide-ranging discovery against a foreign country--for example, the country where an individual who later committed a terrorist act traveled from or became radicalized. A number of our allies and partners have already contacted us with serious concerns about the bill. By exposing these allies and partners to this sort of litigation in U.S. courts, JASTA threatens to limit their cooperation on key national security issues, including counterterrorism initiatives, at a crucial time when we are trying to build coalitions, not create divisions. The 9/11 attacks were the worst act of terrorism on U.S. soil, and they were met with an unprecedented U.S. Government response. The United States has taken robust and wide-ranging actions to provide justice for the victims of the 9/11 attacks and keep Americans safe, from providing financial compensation for victims and their families to conducting worldwide counterterrorism programs to bringing criminal charges against culpable individuals. I have continued and expanded upon these efforts, both to help victims of terrorism gain justice for the loss and suffering of their loved ones and to protect the United States from future attacks. The JASTA, however, does not contribute to these goals, does not enhance the safety of Americans from terrorist attacks, and undermines core U.S. interests. For these reasons, I must veto the bill. Barack Obama. The White House, September 23, 2016. Mr. McCONNELL.

Madam President, virtually every time Donald Trump says or does something discriminatory--and that is often--the media relies upon a catalog of buzzwords to describe his actions. The press uses words like hateful, intolerant, bigot, extremist, prejudice, to name but a few. Yet there is always one word that many of the press conspicuously avoid: Racist. They never label Trump as a racist, but he is a racist. Donald Trump is a racist. ``Racist'' is a term I don't really like. We have all, with rare exception--I don't know who it would be--said things that are not politically correct, but I don't know of anyone, when that happens, who doesn't acknowledge it and, if necessary, apologizes quickly, but Donald Trump doesn't believe the racist things he does and says are wrong. He says them with the full intent to demean and to denigrate. That is who he is. Each time Trump is given a chance to apologize and make amends, he refuses, and then he doubles down on what he said before. The media is not holding Donald Trump accountable at all. He is not being held accountable. So why do reporters and pundits abstain from calling Trump what he is--a racist? It is not as if Trump's racism is new. His bigotry has been on display since the early days of his business career. When Donald Trump was still working at his father's side as second in command, the Department of Justice slapped their company with a civil rights lawsuit. Why? Because they deserved it. Undercover Federal officers in New York found that the Trumps discriminated against potential tenants by rejecting applications for housing from African Americans and Puerto Ricans. Trump has even had a secret system for discriminatory practices. As the Washington Post reported: Trump employees have secretly marked the applications of minorities with codes, such as `No. 9' and `C' for colored. . . . The employees allegedly directed blacks and Puerto Ricans away from buildings with mostly white tenants and steered them toward properties that had many minorities. In the 1980s, Trump took his racism to Atlantic City. This is Donald Trump at his best. He cheated, coerced, filed bankruptcy, did anything he could to cheat people out of money. In the process, his racism came to the forefront in Atlantic City. Trump was accused of making his African-American employees move off the casino floor when he didn't want to see them, which was any time he came to the casino. One employee, Kip Brown, said: When Donald and Ivana came to the casino, the bosses would order all the black people off the floor. It was the eighties, I was a teenager, but I remember it: they put us all in the back. Trump was later fined $200,000 by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission for that act of disgusting racism. In the 1990s, John O'Donnell, the former president of Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino, wrote a book about his time working with Donald Trump. O'Donnell reported that Trump frequently denigrated African Americans. He remembers a lot, but he specifically remembers Trump saying of his accountants: I've got black accountants at Trump Castle and Trump Plaza. Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day. How about that? I've got black accountants at Trump Castle and Trump Plaza. Black guys counting my money! I hate it. Those are words from Donald Trump's mouth. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day. That is what he said. Speaking of another African-American employee, Trump told O'Donnell: I think the guy is lazy. And it's probably not his fault because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is. I believe that. [[Page S6074]] That is Donald Trump. He thinks that Blacks are lazy and that they can't help it because it is one of their traits. Trump didn't deny it. He later admitted: ``The stuff O'Donnell wrote about me is probably true.'' But since Donald Trump became involved in Presidential politics, his racism has reached even new heights. Trump led the so-called birther movement to delegitimize our first African-American President. Last year, announcing his candidacy for President, Trump denounced Mexican immigrants as ``criminals, drug dealers, rapists.'' Consider all of the despicable racist things he has done this year alone. He has repeatedly called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States. Trump attacked a Gold Star dad and a Gold Star mother. They are Muslims. Their son, CPT Humayun Khan, was killed in battle, but Donald Trump didn't only question Mr. Khan, he questioned Mrs. Khan. She was sitting there, and he said: I guess she is not talking because she is forbidden to speak by Islam. Donald Trump refused to condemn former KKK grand wizard David Duke, who is still in politics. Donald Trump has retweeted messages from Nazi sympathizers and White supremacists. Donald Trump launched a racist attack on U.S. District Court Judge Curiel, a man born in Indiana, but Trump didn't like that because his mom and dad were of Mexican heritage. He said he should be disqualified from hearing the case. Speaker Ryan called Trump's offensive attack ``a textbook definition of a racist comment.'' This is the U.S. House of Representatives Speaker, who acknowledges that his Republican Presidential nominee is a racist. Yet here we are, 7 weeks from election day, and the Speaker of the House and the Senate Republican leader are both endorsing this racist man. Republicans should not support a man for President who by their Speaker's own admission is the textbook definition of a racist. Think of the example Republicans are setting for our Nation's youth. Republicans are normalizing this racist behavior. This will be their legacy--one of them. They have plenty to add to that. Those who refuse to denounce Donald Trump's actions as racism are complicit in propagating and normalizing his hate. It is time for reporters and journalists to be honest with the American people. They owe Americans the truth: Through his words and deeds, Donald Trump is a racist. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6073-S6074] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DONALD TRUMP Mr. REID.

We have all, with rare exception--I don't know who it would be--said things that are not politically correct, but I don't know of anyone, when that happens, who doesn't acknowledge it and, if necessary, apologizes quickly, but Donald Trump doesn't believe the racist things he does and says are wrong. He says them with the full intent to demean and to denigrate. That is who he is. Each time Trump is given a chance to apologize and make amends, he refuses, and then he doubles down on what he said before. The media is not holding Donald Trump accountable at all. He is not being held accountable. So why do reporters and pundits abstain from calling Trump what he is--a racist? It is not as if Trump's racism is new. His bigotry has been on display since the early days of his business career. When Donald Trump was still working at his father's side as second in command, the Department of Justice slapped their company with a civil rights lawsuit. Why? Because they deserved it. Undercover Federal officers in New York found that the Trumps discriminated against potential tenants by rejecting applications for housing from African Americans and Puerto Ricans. Trump has even had a secret system for discriminatory practices. As the Washington Post reported: Trump employees have secretly marked the applications of minorities with codes, such as `No. 9' and `C' for colored. . . . The employees allegedly directed blacks and Puerto Ricans away from buildings with mostly white tenants and steered them toward properties that had many minorities. In the 1980s, Trump took his racism to Atlantic City. This is Donald Trump at his best. He cheated, coerced, filed bankruptcy, did anything he could to cheat people out of money. In the process, his racism came to the forefront in Atlantic City. Trump was accused of making his African-American employees move off the casino floor when he didn't want to see them, which was any time he came to the casino. One employee, Kip Brown, said: When Donald and Ivana came to the casino, the bosses would order all the black people off the floor. It was the eighties, I was a teenager, but I remember it: they put us all in the back. Trump was later fined $200,000 by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission for that act of disgusting racism. In the 1990s, John O'Donnell, the former president of Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino, wrote a book about his time working with Donald Trump. O'Donnell reported that Trump frequently denigrated African Americans. He remembers a lot, but he specifically remembers Trump saying of his accountants: I've got black accountants at Trump Castle and Trump Plaza. Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day. How about that? I've got black accountants at Trump Castle and Trump Plaza. Black guys counting my money! I hate it. Those are words from Donald Trump's mouth. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day. That is what he said. Speaking of another African-American employee, Trump told O'Donnell: I think the guy is lazy. And it's probably not his fault because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is. I believe that. [[Page S6074]] That is Donald Trump. He thinks that Blacks are lazy and that they can't help it because it is one of their traits. Trump didn't deny it. He later admitted: ``The stuff O'Donnell wrote about me is probably true.'' But since Donald Trump became involved in Presidential politics, his racism has reached even new heights. Trump led the so-called birther movement to delegitimize our first African-American President. Last year, announcing his candidacy for President, Trump denounced Mexican immigrants as ``criminals, drug dealers, rapists.'' Consider all of the despicable racist things he has done this year alone. He has repeatedly called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States. Trump attacked a Gold Star dad and a Gold Star mother. They are Muslims. Their son, CPT Humayun Khan, was killed in battle, but Donald Trump didn't only question Mr. Khan, he questioned Mrs. Khan. She was sitting there, and he said: I guess she is not talking because she is forbidden to speak by Islam. Donald Trump refused to condemn former KKK grand wizard David Duke, who is still in politics. Donald Trump has retweeted messages from Nazi sympathizers and White supremacists. Donald Trump launched a racist attack on U.S. District Court Judge Curiel, a man born in Indiana, but Trump didn't like that because his mom and dad were of Mexican heritage. He said he should be disqualified from hearing the case. Speaker Ryan called Trump's offensive attack ``a textbook definition of a racist comment.'' This is the U.S. House of Representatives Speaker, who acknowledges that his Republican Presidential nominee is a racist. Yet here we are, 7 weeks from election day, and the Speaker of the House and the Senate Republican leader are both endorsing this racist man. Republicans should not support a man for President who by their Speaker's own admission is the textbook definition of a racist. Think of the example Republicans are setting for our Nation's youth. Republicans are normalizing this racist behavior. This will be their legacy--one of them. They have plenty to add to that. Those who refuse to denounce Donald Trump's actions as racism are complicit in propagating and normalizing his hate. It is time for reporters and journalists to be honest with the American people. They owe Americans the truth: Through his words and deeds, Donald Trump is a racist. ____________________",package_114_204.csv,6344,6344,6416,"[congressional record volume 162, number 145 (monday, september 26, 2016)] [senate] [pages s6073-s6074] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] donald trump mr. reid. madam president, virtually every time donald trump says or does something discriminatory--and that is often--the media relies upon a catalog of buzzwords to describe his actions. the press uses words like hateful, intolerant, bigot, extremist, prejudice, to name but a few. yet there is always one word that many of the press conspicuously avoid: racist. they never label trump as a racist, but he is a racist. donald trump is a racist. ``racist'' is a term i don't really like. we have all, with rare exception--i don't know who it would be--said things that are not politically correct, but i don't know of anyone, when that happens, who doesn't acknowledge it and, if necessary, apologizes quickly, but donald trump doesn't believe the racist things he does and says are wrong. he says them with the full intent to demean and to denigrate. that is who he is. each time trump is given a chance to apologize and make amends, he refuses, and then he doubles down on what he said before. the media is not holding donald trump accountable at all. he is not being held accountable. so why do reporters and pundits abstain from calling trump what he is--a racist? it is not as if trump's racism is new. his bigotry has been on display since the early days of his business career. when donald trump was still working at his father's side as second in command, the department of justice slapped their company with a civil rights lawsuit. why? because they deserved it. undercover federal officers in new york found that the trumps discriminated against potential tenants by rejecting applications for housing from african americans and puerto ricans. trump has even had a secret system for discriminatory practices. as the washington post reported: trump employees have secretly marked the applications of minorities with codes, such as `no. 9' and `c' for colored. . . . the employees allegedly directed blacks and puerto ricans away from buildings with mostly white tenants and steered them toward properties that had many minorities. in the 1980s, trump took his racism to atlantic city. this is donald trump at his best. he cheated, coerced, filed bankruptcy, did anything he could to cheat people out of money. in the process, his racism came to the forefront in atlantic city. trump was accused of making his african-american employees move off the casino floor when he didn't want to see them, which was any time he came to the casino. one employee, kip brown, said: when donald and ivana came to the casino, the bosses would order all the black people off the floor. it was the eighties, i was a teenager, but i remember it: they put us all in the back. trump was later fined $200,000 by the new jersey casino control commission for that act of disgusting racism. in the 1990s, john o'donnell, the former president of trump plaza hotel and casino, wrote a book about his time working with donald trump. o'donnell reported that trump frequently denigrated african americans. he remembers a lot, but he specifically remembers trump saying of his accountants: i've got black accountants at trump castle and trump plaza. black guys counting my money! i hate it. the only kind of people i want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day. how about that? i've got black accountants at trump castle and trump plaza. black guys counting my money! i hate it. those are words from donald trump's mouth. the only kind of people i want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day. that is what he said. speaking of another african-american employee, trump told o'donnell: i think the guy is lazy. and it's probably not his fault because laziness is a trait in blacks. it really is. i believe that.

CREC-2016-09-26-pt1-PgS6074,CREC-2016-09-26,114,CONTINUING RESOLUTION,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6074-S6075] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONTINUING RESOLUTION Mr. REID. Madam President, I want to make a few comments on the CR. Senator McConnell has given a great statement, but about whom? It is a straw man argument. We don't oppose the Zika legislation. We don't oppose helping flood victims. But we want more. We think it should be taken care of, but it hasn't been in this bill, that is for sure. On opioids, we think it should be really funded, not this pitter path that doesn't do anything. What it does is allow you to spend money that is not here. We think we should do the Shaheen legislation and pay for it. We do believe we should not leave Flint behind, though. The CR proposed by the Republicans is short on a number of issues, and I will talk only about two of them this afternoon. I was especially disappointed to see the Republicans' proposal regarding another disaster--a disaster that has been ongoing for well over a year. This CR, this funding measure, does not put a single penny toward Flint, MI--not a penny. The people of Flint, MI, have been waiting for emergency assistance to clean up poison water for more than a year. There are 100,000 people--children--lead-poisoned already. Senate Republicans claim they will address the needs of Flint when we return after the election. Well, we have heard that before, haven't we? That has been the Republicans go-to move in stalling funding for Flint--they always claim they will do it at a later time. Flint has heard this and heard this and heard this. In the meantime, the people of Flint, if they are fortunate, can take a drink of water out of a bottle and bathe in bottled water. We ran out of time months ago. We ran out of time when the Republicans decided to take a 7-week vacation, which is something that was remarkable in history, in more than 60 years. With the time we are going to have off before December 9 with the funding resolution, it will be the longest break the Senate has had going back, we believe, to before the Depression--the Great Depression, not the Bush depression. The crisis has been going on for a long time. Two and a half years ago, Flint learned that its water was not safe. Nine months ago, Republican Governor Snyder and President Obama declared the Flint, MI, water crisis an emergency. Five months ago, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee passed water infrastructure legislation with a bipartisan aid package for Flint. I commend the chairman of that committee, Senator Inhofe, over and over for agreeing to do the fair thing. That package was voted out of the Senate less than 2 weeks ago on a vote of 95 to 3 as part of the so-called WRDA Act, but the House Republicans made it clear they have no intention of putting funding for Flint in that bill. Still the people of Flint wait for assistance. I have heard all the happy talk: Well, the Republicans are going to take care of this. Call and tell me you are going to take care of it. Give me some assurances that you are going to take care of it because 100,000 Flint residents continue to struggle with having safe water to drink. In fact, 40 percent of the people of Flint live below the poverty line. Flint, MI, is a community of color--African Americans. The junior Senator from Louisiana was especially callous in dismissing the people of Flint. It is hard to acknowledge what he said, but I am going to do it. He called the residents of Flint ``other people's grief.'' Well, using his analogy, the things we have done over the years with all the problems that Louisiana has had--hurricanes, floods, wind storms, and this latest ravaging rain they got--in Nevada, I guess that is somebody else's problem--the people of Louisiana. The many problems we have had in Texas over the last decade--they are everybody's problem, but not by the definition of the Senator from Louisiana. They are not other people's grief. I would suggest the relatively new Senator from Louisiana needs to figure out what the name of his job is. It is United States Senator-- not State senator from Louisiana, United States Senator. He can look out for the people of Louisiana and yet turn a cold shoulder to fellow Americans in Michigan. Congress must act to address emergencies whenever and wherever they occur, especially to help vulnerable Americans, because every one of these emergencies is creating lots of vulnerable Americans. The people of Flint deserve justice, and 90,000 children who have been lead-poisoned deserve justice. But instead of helping the people of Flint, they promise to use this government funding measure to feed their addiction to undisclosed and unaccountable dark money. What the Republican leader stuck in this funding resolution is a provision to prevent the Securities and Exchange Commission from telling corporations that they must disclose campaign contributions. If ever there were legislation contained in a resolution that didn't deserve to be there, it would be that. Shadowy interest groups are spending hundreds of millions of dollars on trying to elect handpicked political candidates. What is this dark money? It is all these advertisements with all these phony front groups, most of which are funded by the Koch brothers. You won't see their name on anything other than something to divert your attention--a public service announcement about how good Koch Industries is for creating jobs. Well, Koch Industries is great for trying to get richer and richer and trying to enrich these two wealthy, Republican, rightwing men who are doing everything they can to buy America. They are doing pretty well, I have to give them credit for that. If they continue the way they are, they are going to be first in line. They are going to be the No. 1 oligarch in America, and they can match to see if they are entitled to be even a notch higher than the No. 1 oligarch in Russia. Russia is an oligarchy, and because [[Page S6075]] of the Koch brothers, America is turning into one. And what does the Republican leader do? He sticks a provision in this legislation to protect them even further. Current Federal law requires publicly traded corporations to disclose financial details on their annual report to shareholders, such as how much they are paying their executive officers and others, but shareholders--the true owners of corporations--have no idea how much money is being spent on politics, being directed by a few in the corporations. The Securities and Exchange Commission does not require this to be reported. Last August, 44 Democratic Senators sent a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission in support of adding political disclosures in their annual shareholder reports. The Republican leader wants to stop this. He wants to do everything he can to protect the Koch brothers. But the Securities and Exchange Commission received 1 million public comments in support of disclosure because it protects the interests of investors--1 million comments. That is unheard of. The Republicans in the Senate are opposed to disclosure. That is why the Republican leader has attached this so-called rider to the government funding bill to prevent shareholders from knowing how their money is spent and being used in the political process. Republicans are holding the government hostage because they want to keep the political system awash in dark money. They want to give contributions to the Chamber of Commerce, the National Rifle Association, and on and on-- millions and millions of dollars. The Senate Republicans need to rethink their priorities. Republicans need to spend less time worrying about the balance in their campaign accounts and more time protecting their fellow Americans, especially those in Flint, MI. Madam President, I see my friend the senior Senator from Iowa on the floor. Before he speaks, will the Chair announce the business of the day. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6074-S6075] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONTINUING RESOLUTION Mr. REID.

They are doing pretty well, I have to give them credit for that. If they continue the way they are, they are going to be first in line. They are going to be the No. 1 oligarch in America, and they can match to see if they are entitled to be even a notch higher than the No. 1 oligarch in Russia. Russia is an oligarchy, and because [[Page S6075]] of the Koch brothers, America is turning into one. And what does the Republican leader do? He sticks a provision in this legislation to protect them even further. Current Federal law requires publicly traded corporations to disclose financial details on their annual report to shareholders, such as how much they are paying their executive officers and others, but shareholders--the true owners of corporations--have no idea how much money is being spent on politics, being directed by a few in the corporations. The Securities and Exchange Commission does not require this to be reported. Last August, 44 Democratic Senators sent a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission in support of adding political disclosures in their annual shareholder reports. The Republican leader wants to stop this. He wants to do everything he can to protect the Koch brothers. But the Securities and Exchange Commission received 1 million public comments in support of disclosure because it protects the interests of investors--1 million comments. That is unheard of. The Republicans in the Senate are opposed to disclosure. That is why the Republican leader has attached this so-called rider to the government funding bill to prevent shareholders from knowing how their money is spent and being used in the political process. Republicans are holding the government hostage because they want to keep the political system awash in dark money. They want to give contributions to the Chamber of Commerce, the National Rifle Association, and on and on-- millions and millions of dollars. The Senate Republicans need to rethink their priorities. Republicans need to spend less time worrying about the balance in their campaign accounts and more time protecting their fellow Americans, especially those in Flint, MI. Madam President, I see my friend the senior Senator from Iowa on the floor. Before he speaks, will the Chair announce the business of the day. ____________________",package_114_204.csv,8046,8046,8118,"[congressional record volume 162, number 145 (monday, september 26, 2016)] [senate] [pages s6074-s6075] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] continuing resolution mr. reid. madam president, i want to make a few comments on the cr. senator mcconnell has given a great statement, but about whom? it is a straw man argument. we don't oppose the zika legislation. we don't oppose helping flood victims. but we want more. we think it should be taken care of, but it hasn't been in this bill, that is for sure. on opioids, we think it should be really funded, not this pitter path that doesn't do anything. what it does is allow you to spend money that is not here. we think we should do the shaheen legislation and pay for it. we do believe we should not leave flint behind, though. the cr proposed by the republicans is short on a number of issues, and i will talk only about two of them this afternoon. i was especially disappointed to see the republicans' proposal regarding another disaster--a disaster that has been ongoing for well over a year. this cr, this funding measure, does not put a single penny toward flint, mi--not a penny. the people of flint, mi, have been waiting for emergency assistance to clean up poison water for more than a year. there are 100,000 people--children--lead-poisoned already. senate republicans claim they will address the needs of flint when we return after the election. well, we have heard that before, haven't we? that has been the republicans go-to move in stalling funding for flint--they always claim they will do it at a later time. flint has heard this and heard this and heard this. in the meantime, the people of flint, if they are fortunate, can take a drink of water out of a bottle and bathe in bottled water. we ran out of time months ago. we ran out of time when the republicans decided to take a 7-week vacation, which is something that was remarkable in history, in more than 60 years. with the time we are going to have off before december 9 with the funding resolution, it will be the longest break the senate has had going back, we believe, to before the depression--the great depression, not the bush depression. the crisis has been going on for a long time. two and a half years ago, flint learned that its water was not safe. nine months ago, republican governor snyder and president obama declared the flint, mi, water crisis an emergency. five months ago, the senate environment and public works committee passed water infrastructure legislation with a bipartisan aid package for flint. i commend the chairman of that committee, senator inhofe, over and over for agreeing to do the fair thing. that package was voted out of the senate less than 2 weeks ago on a vote of 95 to 3 as part of the so-called wrda act, but the house republicans made it clear they have no intention of putting funding for flint in that bill. still the people of flint wait for assistance. i have heard all the happy talk: well, the republicans are going to take care of this. call and tell me you are going to take care of it. give me some assurances that you are going to take care of it because 100,000 flint residents continue to struggle with having safe water to drink. in fact, 40 percent of the people of flint live below the poverty line. flint, mi, is a community of color--african americans. the junior senator from louisiana was especially callous in dismissing the people of flint. it is hard to acknowledge what he said, but i am going to do it. he called the residents of flint ``other people's grief.'' well, using his analogy, the things we have done over the years with all the problems that louisiana has had--hurricanes, floods, wind storms, and this latest ravaging rain they got--in nevada, i guess that is somebody else's problem--the people of louisiana. the many problems we have had in texas over the last decade--they are everybody's problem, but not by the definition of the senator from louisiana. they are not other people's grief. i would suggest the relatively new senator from louisiana needs to figure out what the name of his job is. it is united states senator-- not state senator from louisiana, united states senator. he can look out for the people of louisiana and yet turn a cold shoulder to fellow americans in michigan. congress must act to address emergencies whenever and wherever they occur, especially to help vulnerable americans, because every one of these emergencies is creating lots of vulnerable americans. the people of flint deserve justice, and 90,000 children who have been lead-poisoned deserve justice. but instead of helping the people of flint, they promise to use this government funding measure to feed their addiction to undisclosed and unaccountable dark money. what the republican leader stuck in this funding resolution is a provision to prevent the securities and exchange commission from telling corporations that they must disclose campaign contributions. if ever there were legislation contained in a resolution that didn't deserve to be there, it would be that. shadowy interest groups are spending hundreds of millions of dollars on trying to elect handpicked political candidates. what is this dark money? it is all these advertisements with all these phony front groups, most of which are funded by the koch brothers. you won't see their name on anything other than something to divert your attention--a public service announcement about how good koch industries is for creating jobs. well, koch industries is great for trying to get richer and richer and trying to enrich these two wealthy, republican, rightwing men who are doing everything they can to buy america. they are doing pretty well, i have to give them credit for that. if they continue the way they are, they are going to be first in line. they are going to be the no. 1 oligarch in america, and they can match to see if they are entitled to be even a notch higher than the no. 1 oligarch in russia. russia is an oligarchy, and because [[page s6075]] of the koch brothers, america is turning into one. and what does the republican leader do?

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa. Iowa Floods Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, natural disasters happen. Eight years ago, Senator Harkin and I had to deal with flooding in Eastern Iowa. Today Senator Ernst and I are called upon to observe--as we did this past weekend--a great amount of flooding in Eastern Iowa. Earlier this year, we also heard the Senators from West Virginia and the Senators from Louisiana speak about the natural disasters in their State. It was only 8 years ago that I was on the floor talking about the record devastation caused by severe storms and floods. Many of the same places are currently experiencing similar flooding as rivers are cresting at record or near-record levels. On Saturday, I toured several cities with the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor, and Members of the Iowa congressional delegation, including Senator Ernst. We saw debris and damage left by receding floodwaters, many homes underwater, and great flood fight preparations. Many businesses and individual volunteers have been working tirelessly to help prevent damage to both public and private property and to help clean up. Today I had a discussion with the mayor of Greene, IA, about the numbers of high schools that are closed in that area, but the kids are coming in to help clean up in the city of Greene, IA. This is the Iowa way. I thank those who have helped and will provide assistance in the future. Since the floods of 2008, many lessons have been learned. Plans and training to protect Iowa communities are in place. I am pleased to report that the mitigation through Federal, State, and local resources that has taken place throughout Iowa since the floods of 2008 has been beneficial. This has already proven effective and will lessen the impact of this year's floods. It is estimated that more than $50 million of reduced impact will be experienced because of previous mitigation efforts. However, as we learned this weekend, so much remains to be done. Iowa's second largest city, Cedar Rapids, experienced massive devastation, with more than 1,300 city blocks covered in water and over $32 billion worth of damages from the floods of 2008. Today, as a result of massive amounts of rain upstream over the last few days, the city of Cedar Rapids is fighting to prepare for the high crest on the Cedar River, second only to 2008. Cedar Rapids is doing everything it can to protect its citizens by using HESCO barriers, earthen levees, and berms. However, a permanent solution through permanent flood control structures is still very much needed. Even prior to the 2008 floods, the protection of the Cedar River in Cedar Rapids was identified as needing evaluation. In 2006, Congress authorized a flood risk management feasibility study with the feasibility cost share arrangement being signed on May 30, 2008. Since then, the feasibility study was completed and alternatives were chosen, although this Federal project protects only a portion of Cedar Rapids. I worked to get the construction of the project authorized in the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014. That happened to be the first WRDA bill since 2007. However, funding has been difficult to obtain since the benefit-cost ratio is just over one from the point of view of the Corps of Engineers' scoring. I am pleased the Senate instructed the Army Corps of Engineers to expedite this and three other flood damage reduction and flood risk management projects in the recently passed Water Resources Development Act. Also in this year's act, the Senate passed an amendment to the bill that I was pleased to cosponsor with my colleague, Senator Ernst, requiring the Government Accountability Office to study the Army Corps of Engineers' methodology and performance metrics used to calculate benefit-cost ratios when evaluating construction projects. I have heard from Cedar Rapids, Des Moines, and several other places in Iowa regarding their concerns about how the Corps calculates the benefit of structures and that mitigation and future savings is not a strong factor in determining flood risk management. Let me say that as I talk to people in Iowa--but particularly in Cedar Rapids, IA--about the cost-benefit ratio, mitigation, and future savings not being taken so much into consideration, it is something that they just do not understand. I recognize that this is a complex issue and that the Corps rarely gets enough funding to maintain and operate what it owns, let alone start numerous construction projects. I also recognize the need to have a rationale on how to prioritize projects when there are scarce resources, and I have been supportive of these efforts. However, a one-size-fits-all approach doesn't work when dealing with flood protection. This is the most difficult thing to explain to people in Cedar Rapids, IA. It is a necessity to more accurately quantify future benefits and the protection of citizens when making benefit-cost ratios. We also need to find a way to expedite these flood projects so it doesn't take 20 to 40 [[Page S6076]] years to study, design, and build--and it seems as if it takes forever to get completed. Again, Iowans--especially the people of Cedar Rapids--when they are faced with severe, repeated flooding, don't understand why the Federal Government does not prioritize flood risk management and mitigation instead of spending emergency money to fight, recover, and then put them back in the same position as they were before. That money was spent in 2008--maybe not as much money, but still a great deal of money was spent this year--and still they are in the same position. That is what is not seemed to be understood. This money would be better spent actually mitigating the problem and protecting citizens and their property. I have heard of similar concerns all across the United States, not just in Iowa. My staff has surveyed articles from Louisiana, Texas, New Jersey, and Idaho, all stating similar concerns. I am sure that if we continued to look, we would find others as well. I call on the Army Corps of Engineers to carefully evaluate how they can improve their areas of flood control policy. Reforms have taken place to expedite the study, planning, and report process, but reforms are needed to how they make these determinations. I also call on the Office of Management and Budget and my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee to change the way the Army Corps of Engineers receives its funding. Every part of the Corps' budget could be considered an earmark under Senate rules. Therefore, it is very hard to advocate for the needs of the Corps' districts and projects within Congress without violating the earmark ban. As a result, the primary decision about what is included in the Corps' budget rests with the President's budget each year. I am not advocating to bring back earmarks for specific projects but to fund the Corps in a programmatic way or by district to allow Congress to exercise its oversight over funding decisions. All branches need to be held accountable for spending decisions, including the Federal bureaucracy. Congress should have the power of the purse for funding decisions of such importance to the people we represent, not just some bureaucrat. Retired MG Tom Sands, who was a commanding General of the Army Corps of Engineers' Lower Mississippi Valley Division and president of the Mississippi River Commission, in a blog for The Hill newspaper on September 7 of this year, wrote: No doubt the rationale for the current uniform approach [at the Corps] is to foster ``fairness.'' But federal water policy would be better focused on how to quantify and achieve superior outcomes. This new approach needs to focus more on common sense than on bureaucratic decisions. As I have based my work as a public servant on Iowa's common sense, not bureaucratic nonsense, I couldn't have said it better than General Sands, so I associate myself with his remarks. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats).

Eight years ago, Senator Harkin and I had to deal with flooding in Eastern Iowa. Today Senator Ernst and I are called upon to observe--as we did this past weekend--a great amount of flooding in Eastern Iowa. Earlier this year, we also heard the Senators from West Virginia and the Senators from Louisiana speak about the natural disasters in their State. It was only 8 years ago that I was on the floor talking about the record devastation caused by severe storms and floods. Many of the same places are currently experiencing similar flooding as rivers are cresting at record or near-record levels. On Saturday, I toured several cities with the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor, and Members of the Iowa congressional delegation, including Senator Ernst. We saw debris and damage left by receding floodwaters, many homes underwater, and great flood fight preparations. Many businesses and individual volunteers have been working tirelessly to help prevent damage to both public and private property and to help clean up. Today I had a discussion with the mayor of Greene, IA, about the numbers of high schools that are closed in that area, but the kids are coming in to help clean up in the city of Greene, IA. This is the Iowa way. I thank those who have helped and will provide assistance in the future. Since the floods of 2008, many lessons have been learned. Plans and training to protect Iowa communities are in place. I am pleased to report that the mitigation through Federal, State, and local resources that has taken place throughout Iowa since the floods of 2008 has been beneficial. This has already proven effective and will lessen the impact of this year's floods. It is estimated that more than $50 million of reduced impact will be experienced because of previous mitigation efforts. However, as we learned this weekend, so much remains to be done. Iowa's second largest city, Cedar Rapids, experienced massive devastation, with more than 1,300 city blocks covered in water and over $32 billion worth of damages from the floods of 2008. Today, as a result of massive amounts of rain upstream over the last few days, the city of Cedar Rapids is fighting to prepare for the high crest on the Cedar River, second only to 2008. Cedar Rapids is doing everything it can to protect its citizens by using HESCO barriers, earthen levees, and berms. However, a permanent solution through permanent flood control structures is still very much needed. Even prior to the 2008 floods, the protection of the Cedar River in Cedar Rapids was identified as needing evaluation. In 2006, Congress authorized a flood risk management feasibility study with the feasibility cost share arrangement being signed on May 30, 2008. Since then, the feasibility study was completed and alternatives were chosen, although this Federal project protects only a portion of Cedar Rapids. I worked to get the construction of the project authorized in the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014. That happened to be the first WRDA bill since 2007. However, funding has been difficult to obtain since the benefit-cost ratio is just over one from the point of view of the Corps of Engineers' scoring. I am pleased the Senate instructed the Army Corps of Engineers to expedite this and three other flood damage reduction and flood risk management projects in the recently passed Water Resources Development Act. Also in this year's act, the Senate passed an amendment to the bill that I was pleased to cosponsor with my colleague, Senator Ernst, requiring the Government Accountability Office to study the Army Corps of Engineers' methodology and performance metrics used to calculate benefit-cost ratios when evaluating construction projects. I have heard from Cedar Rapids, Des Moines, and several other places in Iowa regarding their concerns about how the Corps calculates the benefit of structures and that mitigation and future savings is not a strong factor in determining flood risk management. Let me say that as I talk to people in Iowa--but particularly in Cedar Rapids, IA--about the cost-benefit ratio, mitigation, and future savings not being taken so much into consideration, it is something that they just do not understand. I recognize that this is a complex issue and that the Corps rarely gets enough funding to maintain and operate what it owns, let alone start numerous construction projects. I also recognize the need to have a rationale on how to prioritize projects when there are scarce resources, and I have been supportive of these efforts. However, a one-size-fits-all approach doesn't work when dealing with flood protection. This is the most difficult thing to explain to people in Cedar Rapids, IA. It is a necessity to more accurately quantify future benefits and the protection of citizens when making benefit-cost ratios. We also need to find a way to expedite these flood projects so it doesn't take 20 to 40 [[Page S6076]] years to study, design, and build--and it seems as if it takes forever to get completed. Again, Iowans--especially the people of Cedar Rapids--when they are faced with severe, repeated flooding, don't understand why the Federal Government does not prioritize flood risk management and mitigation instead of spending emergency money to fight, recover, and then put them back in the same position as they were before. That money was spent in 2008--maybe not as much money, but still a great deal of money was spent this year--and still they are in the same position. That is what is not seemed to be understood. This money would be better spent actually mitigating the problem and protecting citizens and their property. I have heard of similar concerns all across the United States, not just in Iowa. My staff has surveyed articles from Louisiana, Texas, New Jersey, and Idaho, all stating similar concerns. I am sure that if we continued to look, we would find others as well. I call on the Army Corps of Engineers to carefully evaluate how they can improve their areas of flood control policy. Reforms have taken place to expedite the study, planning, and report process, but reforms are needed to how they make these determinations. I also call on the Office of Management and Budget and my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee to change the way the Army Corps of Engineers receives its funding. Every part of the Corps' budget could be considered an earmark under Senate rules. Therefore, it is very hard to advocate for the needs of the Corps' districts and projects within Congress without violating the earmark ban. As a result, the primary decision about what is included in the Corps' budget rests with the President's budget each year. I am not advocating to bring back earmarks for specific projects but to fund the Corps in a programmatic way or by district to allow Congress to exercise its oversight over funding decisions. All branches need to be held accountable for spending decisions, including the Federal bureaucracy. Congress should have the power of the purse for funding decisions of such importance to the people we represent, not just some bureaucrat. Retired MG Tom Sands, who was a commanding General of the Army Corps of Engineers' Lower Mississippi Valley Division and president of the Mississippi River Commission, in a blog for The Hill newspaper on September 7 of this year, wrote: No doubt the rationale for the current uniform approach [at the Corps] is to foster ``fairness.'' But federal water policy would be better focused on how to quantify and achieve superior outcomes. This new approach needs to focus more on common sense than on bureaucratic decisions. As I have based my work as a public servant on Iowa's common sense, not bureaucratic nonsense, I couldn't have said it better than General Sands, so I associate myself with his remarks. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",package_114_204.csv,9676,9676,9748,"[congressional record volume 162, number 145 (monday, september 26, 2016)] [senate] [pages s6075-s6076]

CREC-2016-09-26-pt1-PgS6076-3,CREC-2016-09-26,114,BUDGETARY REVISIONS,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6076-S6078] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] BUDGETARY REVISIONS Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, section 251 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, BBEDCA, establishes statutory limits on discretionary spending and allows for various adjustments to those limits, while sections 302 and 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 allow the chairman of the Budget Committee to establish and make revisions to allocations, aggregates, and levels consistent with those adjustments. The Senate will soon consider S. amendment No. 5082, which provides for continuing appropriations for fiscal year 2017, full-year appropriations for military construction and veterans programs, and [[Page S6077]] funding for the Federal response to the Zika virus. This amendment provides funding to combat the Zika virus. For these efforts, the amendment provides $876 million in budget authority for fiscal year 2016 and $310 million in outlays for fiscal year 2017, respectively. These figures include rescissions of emergency funds in division D of the amendment that provide a partial offset. This legislation includes language that would designate these provisions as emergency funding pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(i) of BBEDCA. The inclusion of these designations makes this spending eligible for an adjustment under the Congressional Budget Act. The amendment also includes funding for military construction outside of the United States that is designated as overseas contingency operations funding pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(ii) of BBEDCA. These provisions provide $172 million in budget authority and $1 million in outlays for fiscal year 2017. The inclusion of the overseas contingency operations designations in these provisions makes this spending eligible for an adjustment under the Congressional Budget Act. Previously, I made adjustments to enforceable budgetary levels to accommodate the conference report to accompany H.R. 2577, which included both the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2017 and supplemental Zika funding. The adjustments I make today take these prior adjustments into consideration and reflect the appropriate level for overall adjustments for considering the Zika and overseas contingency operations funding of this amendment. Further, on May 12, 2016, I filed an adjustment to accommodate emergency spending in S. amendment No. 3896, which included the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017. This emergency provision, which increased outlays by $1 million in fiscal year 2017, is now included in division C of S. amendment 5082, and I am taking my previous adjustment into account for processing this amendment. Finally, division C includes $500 million in budget authority in fiscal year 2016 and $10 million in outlays in fiscal year 2017 for the Community Development Block Grant program to respond to major natural disasters. This provision is designated as being for disaster relief pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(D) of BBEDCA and as such makes adjustments possible to accommodate this spending. As a result, I am increasing the budgetary aggregate for fiscal year 2016 by $385 million in budget authority and decreasing related outlays by $39 million. I am decreasing the budgetary aggregate for fiscal year 2017 by $62 million in outlays. Further, I am revising the budget authority and outlay allocations to the Committee on Appropriations by increasing revised nonsecurity budget authority by $385 million and reducing outlays by $39 million in fiscal year 2016. Finally, I am revising the outlay allocation to the Committee on Appropriations by reducing outlays by $62 million in fiscal year 2017. I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables, which provide details about the adjustment, be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: REVISION TO BUDGETARY AGGREGATES (Pursuant to Section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and S.

Mr. President, section 251 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, BBEDCA, establishes statutory limits on discretionary spending and allows for various adjustments to those limits, while sections 302 and 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 allow the chairman of the Budget Committee to establish and make revisions to allocations, aggregates, and levels consistent with those adjustments. The Senate will soon consider S. amendment No. 5082, which provides for continuing appropriations for fiscal year 2017, full-year appropriations for military construction and veterans programs, and [[Page S6077]] funding for the Federal response to the Zika virus. This amendment provides funding to combat the Zika virus. For these efforts, the amendment provides $876 million in budget authority for fiscal year 2016 and $310 million in outlays for fiscal year 2017, respectively. These figures include rescissions of emergency funds in division D of the amendment that provide a partial offset. This legislation includes language that would designate these provisions as emergency funding pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(i) of BBEDCA. The inclusion of these designations makes this spending eligible for an adjustment under the Congressional Budget Act. The amendment also includes funding for military construction outside of the United States that is designated as overseas contingency operations funding pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(ii) of BBEDCA. These provisions provide $172 million in budget authority and $1 million in outlays for fiscal year 2017. The inclusion of the overseas contingency operations designations in these provisions makes this spending eligible for an adjustment under the Congressional Budget Act. Previously, I made adjustments to enforceable budgetary levels to accommodate the conference report to accompany H.R. 2577, which included both the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2017 and supplemental Zika funding. The adjustments I make today take these prior adjustments into consideration and reflect the appropriate level for overall adjustments for considering the Zika and overseas contingency operations funding of this amendment. Further, on May 12, 2016, I filed an adjustment to accommodate emergency spending in S. amendment No. 3896, which included the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017. This emergency provision, which increased outlays by $1 million in fiscal year 2017, is now included in division C of S. amendment 5082, and I am taking my previous adjustment into account for processing this amendment. Finally, division C includes $500 million in budget authority in fiscal year 2016 and $10 million in outlays in fiscal year 2017 for the Community Development Block Grant program to respond to major natural disasters. This provision is designated as being for disaster relief pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(D) of BBEDCA and as such makes adjustments possible to accommodate this spending. As a result, I am increasing the budgetary aggregate for fiscal year 2016 by $385 million in budget authority and decreasing related outlays by $39 million. I am decreasing the budgetary aggregate for fiscal year 2017 by $62 million in outlays. Further, I am revising the budget authority and outlay allocations to the Committee on Appropriations by increasing revised nonsecurity budget authority by $385 million and reducing outlays by $39 million in fiscal year 2016. Finally, I am revising the outlay allocation to the Committee on Appropriations by reducing outlays by $62 million in fiscal year 2017. I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables, which provide details about the adjustment, be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: REVISION TO BUDGETARY AGGREGATES (Pursuant to Section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and S.

PAUL,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S6076] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO RICHARD A. PAUL Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it has been said that nations that forget its defenders will be itself forgotten. Well, I would like to take a moment to recognize one of those defenders who fought for and secured our freedom during World War II. First, I want to commend Richard Paul for his brave actions and quiet courage--and thank him for a debt that we can never fully repay. I also want to wish him an early happy birthday. On October 23, Richard Paul, first lieutenant of the 13th Army Air Force--from Quincy, IL--will turn 100 years old. What an achievement. Today, I am honored to share his story. Let me take you back to November 29, 1942. On that November day, in the midst of World War II, rather than waiting to have his draft number called, Richard drove down to the nearest Army Air Force Cadet Training Program in Peoria, IL, and volunteered to serve. The next day, he was sworn into the program and told to await further orders. In January 1943, Richard received his orders and reported to Decatur, IL. After stints in Jefferson Barracks, MO, and Galesburg, IL, Richard found himself in Texas for pilot training. On March 12, 1944, Richard graduated from flight school and spent the next 7 weeks in Liberal, KS, learning to fly the B-24 Liberator, an American bomber with the greatest bomb load carrying capacity and longest range of its time. By the spring of 1944, First Lieutenant Richard Paul and his crew flew B- 24 Liberators on 36 combat missions, including two recon missions in the South Pacific theater. Richard also received the Distinguished Flying Cross for his heroism and extraordinary achievement while participating and supporting military operations in an aerial flight. Although he didn't know it at the time, on March 20, 1945, Richard flew his final mission. The following day, he was told he was going back to the States. For all his wartime accomplishments, I think Richard would agree that his greatest achievement happened in flight school, marrying Esther Viola Jewell, who he simply called Vi. After getting permission from his base commander, the chaplain picked Richard and his bride up from the hotel she was staying at in Independence, KS. There was one problem: Richard and Vi didn't have witnesses. So Richard rushed back to the barracks and found two cadets to fill in. Disaster averted. And on Christmas Eve 1943, Richard and Vi were married. They would spend the next 64 Christmases together before Vi passed on December 14, 2008. We owe a great debt to veterans like Richard, who came home after the war and built this Nation. When the war ended, Richard first looked for work as a pilot at a Minneapolis airline. But despite his incredible experience, he was told they received nearly 100 applications from former Army pilots every day and did not have enough jobs. Well, it was the airline's loss and a blessing for the people of Quincy. The following year, Richard became a pharmacist and spent the next 44 years working in Quincy at the Brown Drug Company--the same Brown Drug Company Vi worked at in 1940. There are many advantages of having 100 years on Earth, but on top of the list may be the ability to spread love in so many ways. Whether it was through love of country--while serving as first lieutenant in the 13th Air Force during World War II; love of community--spending 44 years as a pharmacist at the Brown Drug Company; or love of family, raising 4 daughters with his wife, Vi, 8 grandchildren, and 18 great- grandchildren--what an extraordinary legacy. I will close with this: I have heard the first 100 years are the hardest. But I am reminded of what an old ball player once said: ``Age is a case of mind over matter. If you don't mind, it don't matter.'' So when the big day arrives, I hope Richard celebrates with friends and family--and enjoys it. He has earned it. Thank you, Richard, for your service and sacrifice, and congratulations on an outstanding milestone. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S6076] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO RICHARD A.

CREC-2016-09-26-pt1-PgS6078,CREC-2016-09-26,114,TRIBUTE TO JOSEPH BOARDMAN,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S6078] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO JOSEPH BOARDMAN Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the dedication of Joseph Boardman, the president and chief executive officer of Amtrak. After nearly 8 years of service, Mr. Boardman will retire from Amtrak this month. He is the second longest serving leader in Amtrak's history. Mr. Boardman has spent his life in transportation and public service. As a boy, Mr. Boardman would watch the buses passing on Route 69 as he was working in the fields on his family farm. His father persuaded him of the importance of transportation and started him down to the road to a career in public transportation. After graduating from high school, he enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in 1966 and served the United States in Vietnam. He received his bachelor's degree at Cornell and his master's from SUNY Binghamton. Mr. Boardman's transportation career began as a bus driver. Later, he went on to manage the transportation authorities for the cities of Rome and Utica. He also worked in Broome County as the commission of transportation services, before starting his own transportation company in 1995. Mr. Boardman later went on to serve as the longest serving Commissioner of Transportation in New York State's history. In 2005, he became the Administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration. During his transportation career, Mr. Boardman has been a fierce advocate for improving safety. At the Federal Railroad Administration, he played a particularly important role in the development and passage of the 2008 Rail Safety Improve Act. This bill mandated the implementation of positive train control technology to help prevent crashes and fatalities on America's railroads. Under Mr. Boardman's leadership at Amtrak, the railroad led the Nation in implementing this lifesaving technology. At Amtrak, Mr. Boardman has also made improvements in how Amtrak operates. He has been responsible for a host of financial, technical, and safety improvements at the railroad, as well as numerous investments in infrastructure improvements. During Mr. Boardman's tenure, Amtrak has hit its highest ridership levels; annual ridership reached and passed 30 million passengers per year. Amtrak's debt dropped to a third of the 2002 level, which allowed the railroad to replace its aging elective locomotive fleet and improve service on the Northeast corridor. Amtrak has made numerous improvements to its infrastructure thanks to Mr. Boardman's careful stewardship of the Federal investment in Amtrak. In my State, we know just how important that is, as Amtrak works to build the Gateway Project, connecting New Jersey and New York via a new tunnel under the Hudson River. Finally, it goes without saying that Joe Boardman has been the heart and soul of Amtrak. He has been a passionate advocate for maintaining nationwide Amtrak service, for increasing passenger rail service around the country and for providing the best possible service to Amtrak riders. His dedication to the railroad will be sorely missed. I congratulate Mr. Boardman on his service and wish him well in his retirement. Thank you. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S6078] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO JOSEPH BOARDMAN Mr. BOOKER.

Knipling, posthumously received the Golden Goose award for his essential research into the reproductive cycle of the screwworm fly. Dr. Bushland was born in our neighboring State of Minnesota and was raised and educated in my home State of South Dakota. He earned both his bachelor's degree and master's degree in entomology from South Dakota State University. After completing these degrees, he pursued a doctorate from Kansas State University and began a long and fruitful career as a research scientist. During the 38 years Dr. Bushland worked with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's research program, he authored over 70 scientific papers on the science and management of insects. He is most noted for working toward eradication of the screwworm fly. This scourge of man and beast had an annual economic impact of well over $1.8 billion, in today's money, to the livestock industry. Thanks to the research of Dr. Bushland and Dr. Knipling, most Americans have never heard of the screwworm fly, let alone ever dealt personally with its negative impacts.

Consistent with this commitment, over the past 8 years, I have directed my Administration to pursue relentlessly al-Qa'ida, the terrorist group that planned the 9/11 attacks. The heroic efforts of our military and counterterrorism professionals have decimated al- Qa'ida's leadership and killed Osama bin Laden. My Administration also strongly supported, and I signed into law, legislation which ensured that those who bravely responded on that terrible day and other survivors of the attacks will be able to receive treatment for any injuries resulting from the attacks. And my Administration also directed the Intelligence Community to perform a declassification review of ``Part Four of the Joint Congressional Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities Before and After the Terrorist Attacks of September 11,'' so that the families of 9/11 victims and broader public can better understand the information investigators gathered following that dark day of our history. Notwithstanding these significant efforts, I recognize that there is nothing that could ever erase the grief the 9/11 families have endured. My Administration therefore remains resolute in its commitment to assist these families in their pursuit of justice and do whatever we can to prevent another attack in the United States. Enacting JASTA into law, however, would neither protect Americans from terrorist attacks nor improve the effectiveness of our response to such attacks. As drafted, JASTA would allow private litigation against foreign governments in U.S. courts based on allegations that such foreign governments' actions abroad made them responsible for terrorism-related injuries on U.S. soil. This legislation would permit litigation against countries that have neither been designated by the executive branch as state sponsors of terrorism nor taken direct actions in the United States to carry out an attack here. The JASTA would be detrimental to U.S. national interests more broadly, which is why I am returning it without my approval. First, JASTA threatens to reduce the effectiveness of our response to indications that a foreign government has taken steps outside our borders to provide support for terrorism, by taking such matters out of the hands of national security and foreign policy professionals and placing them in the hands of private litigants and courts. Any indication that a foreign government played a role in a terrorist attack on U.S. soil is a matter of deep concern and merits a forceful, unified Federal Government response that considers the wide range of important and effective tools available. One of these tools is designating the foreign government in question as a state sponsor of terrorism, which carries with it a litany of repercussions, including the foreign government being stripped of its sovereign immunity before U.S. courts in certain terrorism-related cases and subjected to a range of sanctions. Given these serious consequences, state sponsor of terrorism designations are made only after national security, foreign policy, and intelligence professionals carefully review all available information to determine whether a country meets the criteria that the Congress established. I contrast, JASTA departs from longstanding standards and practice under our Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and threatens to strip all foreign governments of immunity from judicial process in the United States based solely upon allegations by private litigants that a foreign government's overseas conduct had some role or connection to a group or person that carried out a terrorist attack inside the United States. This would invite consequential decisions to be made based upon incomplete information and risk having different courts reaching different conclusions about the culpability of individual foreign governments and their role in terrorist activities directed against the United States--which is neither an effective nor a coordinated way for us to respond to indications that a foreign government might have been behind a terrorist attack. Second, JASTA would upset longstanding international principles regarding sovereign immunity, putting in place rules that, if applied globally, could have serious implications for U.S. national interests. The United States has a larger international presence, by far, than any other country, and sovereign immunity principles protect our Nation and its Armed Forces, officials, and assistance professionals, from foreign court proceedings. These principles also protect U.S. Government assets from attempted seizure by private litigants abroad. Removing sovereign immunity in U.S. courts from foreign governments that are not designated as state sponsors of terrorism, based solely on allegations that such foreign governments' actions abroad had a connection to terrorism-related injuries on U.S. soil, threatens to undermine these longstanding principles that protect the United States, our forces, and our personnel. Indeed, reciprocity plays a substantial role in foreign relations, and numerous other countries already have laws that allow for the adjustment of a foreign state's immunities based on the treatment their governments receive in the courts of the other state. Enactment of JASTA could encourage foreign governments to act reciprocally and allow their domestic courts to exercise jurisdiction over the United States or U.S. officials--including our men and women in uniform--for allegedly causing injuries overseas via U.S. support to third parties. This could lead to suits against the United States or U.S. officials for actions taken by members of an armed group that received U.S. assistance, misuse of U.S. military equipment by foreign forces, or abuses committed by police units that received U.S. training, even if the allegations at issue ultimately would be without merit. And if any of these litigants were to win judgments--based on foreign domestic laws as applied by foreign courts--they would begin to look to the assets of the U.S. Government held abroad to satisfy those judgments, with potentially serious financial consequences for the United States. Third, JASTA threatens to create complications in our relationships with even our closest partners. If JASTA were enacted, courts could potentially consider even minimal allegations accusing U.S. allies or partners of complicity in a particular terrorist attack in the United States to be sufficient to open the door to litigation and wide-ranging discovery against a foreign country--for example, the country where an individual who later committed a terrorist act traveled from or became radicalized. A number of our allies and partners have already contacted us with serious concerns about the bill. By exposing these allies and partners to this sort of litigation in U.S. courts, JASTA threatens to limit their cooperation on key national security issues, including counterterrorism initiatives, at a crucial time when we are trying to build coalitions, not create divisions. The 9/11 attacks were the worst act of terrorism on U.S. soil, and they were met with an unprecedented U.S. Government response. The United States has taken robust and wide-ranging actions to provide justice for the victims of the 9/11 attacks and keep Americans safe, from providing financial compensation for victims and their families to conducting worldwide counterterrorism programs to bringing criminal charges against culpable individuals. I have continued and expanded upon these efforts, both to help victims of terrorism gain justice for the loss and suffering of their loved ones and to protect the United States from future attacks. The JASTA, however, does not contribute to these goals, does not enhance the safety of Americans from terrorist attacks, and undermines core U.S. interests. For these reasons, I must veto the bill.

DOUG COLLINS of georgia in the house of representatives Tuesday, September 20, 2016 Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5523, the Clyde-Hirsch-Sowers RESPECT Act. I am a proud cosponsor of this critically important bill because it addresses a major problem in current law--a problem that has directly affected at least one of my constituents in Northeast Georgia. In fact, this bill is named after that constituent: Andrew Clyde. Andrew is a good, hardworking man, who is unfortunately all too familiar with the issue we're talking about today. Andrew owns Clyde Armory in Athens, Georgia. This is a legal, successful, firearms business, but it was targeted by the IRS under civil asset forfeiture laws. Andrew is a combat veteran who grew this business in his community. He followed the law, paid his taxes on time, filed all the right paperwork--but that didn't stop several hundred thousand dollars from being seized from his business. I think Andrew summed it up best when he testified before the Ways and Means Committee about this same issue: ``I did not serve three combat tours in Iraq only to come home and be extorted.'' What he doesn't say there--he was being extorted by his own government. In April of 2013, two IRS agents simply showed up at Clyde Armory, and served Andrew with a seizure warrant letting him know that his business bank account had been nearly drained. He was not aware of any laws he may have broken, unintentionally or not, and had practices in place to ensure his business was fully compliant with all laws. Over the course of a few months, the case wound up in federal court. After legal fees and the eventual surrender of $50,000 to the IRS to end the matter, nearly $150,000 had been carved out of the $950,000 seizure. Despite the fact that Andrew is a law-abiding citizen, the government was able to swoop in in the middle of the night and take private property absent evidence of wrongdoing and due process. That is why I have worked so hard on this issue--to prevent this kind of federal intrusion of the worst form. H.R. 5523 would help to address this problem. It would prohibit the IRS from using civil asset forfeiture authority in structuring cases-- the type of case under which Andrew was targeted--unless it can demonstrate probable cause that the funds were connected to criminal activity. Under H.R. 5523, the IRS must also establish notice and post- seizure review procedures for seizures based on structuring violations. This bill is a step in the right direction, and a step towards preventing future wrongful seizures like the one that happened to Andrew Clyde. I thank Congressman Roskam for introducing this important legislation on behalf of Andrew Clyde and other victims of wrongful civil asset forfeiture, and I encourage all of my colleagues to support its passage. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1355] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RESTRAINING EXCESSIVE SEIZURE OF PROPERTY THROUGH THE EXPLOITATION OF CIVIL ASSET FORFEITURE TOOLS ACT ______ speech of HON.

DOUG COLLINS of georgia in the house of representatives Tuesday, September 20, 2016 Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5523, the Clyde-Hirsch-Sowers RESPECT Act. I am a proud cosponsor of this critically important bill because it addresses a major problem in current law--a problem that has directly affected at least one of my constituents in Northeast Georgia. In fact, this bill is named after that constituent: Andrew Clyde. Andrew is a good, hardworking man, who is unfortunately all too familiar with the issue we're talking about today. Andrew owns Clyde Armory in Athens, Georgia. This is a legal, successful, firearms business, but it was targeted by the IRS under civil asset forfeiture laws. Andrew is a combat veteran who grew this business in his community. He followed the law, paid his taxes on time, filed all the right paperwork--but that didn't stop several hundred thousand dollars from being seized from his business. I think Andrew summed it up best when he testified before the Ways and Means Committee about this same issue: ``I did not serve three combat tours in Iraq only to come home and be extorted.'' What he doesn't say there--he was being extorted by his own government. In April of 2013, two IRS agents simply showed up at Clyde Armory, and served Andrew with a seizure warrant letting him know that his business bank account had been nearly drained. He was not aware of any laws he may have broken, unintentionally or not, and had practices in place to ensure his business was fully compliant with all laws. Over the course of a few months, the case wound up in federal court. After legal fees and the eventual surrender of $50,000 to the IRS to end the matter, nearly $150,000 had been carved out of the $950,000 seizure. Despite the fact that Andrew is a law-abiding citizen, the government was able to swoop in in the middle of the night and take private property absent evidence of wrongdoing and due process. That is why I have worked so hard on this issue--to prevent this kind of federal intrusion of the worst form. H.R. 5523 would help to address this problem. It would prohibit the IRS from using civil asset forfeiture authority in structuring cases-- the type of case under which Andrew was targeted--unless it can demonstrate probable cause that the funds were connected to criminal activity. Under H.R. 5523, the IRS must also establish notice and post- seizure review procedures for seizures based on structuring violations. This bill is a step in the right direction, and a step towards preventing future wrongful seizures like the one that happened to Andrew Clyde. I thank Congressman Roskam for introducing this important legislation on behalf of Andrew Clyde and other victims of wrongful civil asset forfeiture, and I encourage all of my colleagues to support its passage. ____________________",package_114_204.csv,3212,3212,3284,"[congressional record volume 162, number 145 (monday, september 26, 2016)] [extensions of remarks] [page e1355] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] restraining excessive seizure of property through the exploitation of civil asset forfeiture tools act ______ speech of hon. doug collins of georgia in the house of representatives tuesday, september 20, 2016 mr. collins of georgia. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of h.r. 5523, the clyde-hirsch-sowers respect act. i am a proud cosponsor of this critically important bill because it addresses a major problem in current law--a problem that has directly affected at least one of my constituents in northeast georgia. in fact, this bill is named after that constituent: andrew clyde. andrew is a good, hardworking man, who is unfortunately all too familiar with the issue we're talking about today. andrew owns clyde armory in athens, georgia. this is a legal, successful, firearms business, but it was targeted by the irs under civil asset forfeiture laws. andrew is a combat veteran who grew this business in his community. he followed the law, paid his taxes on time, filed all the right paperwork--but that didn't stop several hundred thousand dollars from being seized from his business. i think andrew summed it up best when he testified before the ways and means committee about this same issue: ``i did not serve three combat tours in iraq only to come home and be extorted.'' what he doesn't say there--he was being extorted by his own government. in april of 2013, two irs agents simply showed up at clyde armory, and served andrew with a seizure warrant letting him know that his business bank account had been nearly drained. he was not aware of any laws he may have broken, unintentionally or not, and had practices in place to ensure his business was fully compliant with all laws. over the course of a few months, the case wound up in federal court. after legal fees and the eventual surrender of $50,000 to the irs to end the matter, nearly $150,000 had been carved out of the $950,000 seizure. despite the fact that andrew is a law-abiding citizen, the government was able to swoop in in the middle of the night and take private property absent evidence of wrongdoing and due process. that is why i have worked so hard on this issue--to prevent this kind of federal intrusion of the worst form. h.r. 5523 would help to address this problem. it would prohibit the irs from using civil asset forfeiture authority in structuring cases-- the type of case under which andrew was targeted--unless it can demonstrate probable cause that the funds were connected to criminal activity. under h.r. 5523, the irs must also establish notice and post- seizure review procedures for seizures based on structuring violations. this bill is a step in the right direction, and a step towards preventing future wrongful seizures like the one that happened to andrew clyde. i thank congressman roskam for introducing this important legislation on behalf of andrew clyde and other victims of wrongful civil asset forfeiture, and i encourage all of my colleagues to support its passage. ____________________",3212

JARED POLIS of colorado in the house of representatives Thursday, September 22, 2016 Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Rep. Paulsen and Rep. Crowley for bringing H.R. 5719, the Empowering Employees through Stock Ownership Act, to the floor. This is important legislation that will help start-ups attract and retain employees by allowing employees to obtain an ownership stake in those companies without facing cost- prohibitive tax bills. Often, privately held start-ups provide employees stock ownership options as part of their compensation package. Under current law, employees that receive company shares as part of their compensation package must pay the taxes on the value of those shares taxes immediately, long before the employees realize the economic benefit of those shares. This bill would allow employees to defer the tax on stock shares that companies provide employees as part of their compensation package for seven years or until the company can sell their stock on publically traded exchanges. Additionally, it would increase access to company equity for lower-wage earners. Studies have shown that closely held companies that combine employee ownership with employee workplace participation programs have a positive impact on employee productivity and improve overall company performance. Employees working for businesses in my district such as Neighborland and hobbyDB--both located in Boulder--have expressed their support for this bill and will be able to take advantage of its tax benefits. Other types of employee-ownership models have helped businesses have a higher growth rate and stay in business. Employee-ownership models are good for the company, the employees, and the community. In Colorado, there are approximately 118 businesses that use employee-owned businesses that promote employee ownership through stock option plans or ESOPs. A good example of a successful ESOP is Fire Safety Services. The owner, Jeff wanted to be able to offer his employees a stake in the business and converted his business to an ESOP. This allowed him to create a succession plan so the business can remain locally owned. Jeff noted that after the conversion, employee morale was up and sales were up. The New Belgium Brewery, located in Ft. Collins is also an ESOP. From the perspective of the employees, New Belgium has a culture of personal and collective growth--the employees are concerned about the professional growth of their colleagues and also have a vested stake in the management and economic health of the company. The bill before us will make it easier for employees in other privately-held companies to participate in the growth of their company. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1355] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] EMPOWERING EMPLOYEES THROUGH STOCK OWNERSHIP ACT ______ speech of HON.

DAVID LOEBSACK of iowa in the house of representatives Monday, September 26, 2016 Mr. LOEBSACK. Mr. Speaker, today I would like to recognize the wonderful work of Table to Table during Food Rescue Awareness Week, which is being held September 24th through 30th. For the last twenty years, Table to Table has been committed to collecting nutritional, high-quality food from donors and distributing it through food establishments, food pantries, meal sites, and shelters to those who need it most in Johnson County. I grew up in poverty, and I know firsthand what it is like to worry about where my next meal might come from. Growing up, my single mom relied on food stamps at times in order to be able to feed my brothers, sister and me. I strongly believe that no Iowa child or family should go to bed hungry or have to wonder how they will afford their next meal. Hunger unfortunately continues to be a major problem in America and for many Iowa families. In Johnson County, one in seven residents relies on nutritional assistance in some way. That is why I am so grateful for Table to Table's efforts to fight food insecurity. Founded in 1996, Table to Table was the first food rescue charity in Iowa. Since then, Table to Table has provided the equivalent of 12.5 million meals consisting of food that would otherwise have been wasted and deposited in the landfill.

DAVID LOEBSACK of iowa in the house of representatives Monday, September 26, 2016 Mr. LOEBSACK. Mr. Speaker, today I would like to recognize the wonderful work of Table to Table during Food Rescue Awareness Week, which is being held September 24th through 30th. For the last twenty years, Table to Table has been committed to collecting nutritional, high-quality food from donors and distributing it through food establishments, food pantries, meal sites, and shelters to those who need it most in Johnson County. I grew up in poverty, and I know firsthand what it is like to worry about where my next meal might come from. Growing up, my single mom relied on food stamps at times in order to be able to feed my brothers, sister and me. I strongly believe that no Iowa child or family should go to bed hungry or have to wonder how they will afford their next meal. Hunger unfortunately continues to be a major problem in America and for many Iowa families. In Johnson County, one in seven residents relies on nutritional assistance in some way. That is why I am so grateful for Table to Table's efforts to fight food insecurity. Founded in 1996, Table to Table was the first food rescue charity in Iowa. Since then, Table to Table has provided the equivalent of 12.5 million meals consisting of food that would otherwise have been wasted and deposited in the landfill. This great organization has over 100 regular volunteers, collects from over 40 donation sites, and delivers to 36 agency sites.

KEITH ELLISON of minnesota in the house of representatives Monday, September 26, 2016 Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Metro Transit on being named Transit System of the Year. This year, Metro Transit served nearly 86 million riders while offering excellent and reliable service. The American Public Transportation Association's Outstanding Public Transportation System Achievement Award reflects accomplishments made between 2013 and 2015. During this time, Metro Transit increased ridership, expanded access, improved sustainability practices, and increased overall success in system safety. Metro Transit was singled out among all North America agencies that provide more than 20 million annual passenger trips. Metro Transit plays a vital role in the Twin Cities by providing clean, safe, reliable, and affordable transportation service every day to thousands of commuters, residents, workers, and visitors. In 2015, Metro Transit had its highest ridership in 30 years, with total annual rides of over 85 million. Metro Transit's commitment to sustainability through its transition to lower emission vehicles benefits everyone in the region, whether they use transit or not. Metro Transit not only makes transportation more accessible to workers, it also employs over 3,100 people in the Twin Cities. I am pleased to say that Metro Transit contributes to the quality of life and preserves the livability of the Twin Cities by mitigating traffic impacts, providing easier access to local businesses, reducing air pollution, and improving circulation throughout the cities. On behalf of the residents of Minnesota's 5th Congressional District, I congratulate the entire Metro Transit System, its employees, and its Board of Directors, for their efforts and significant contributions to the Greater Minneapolis Area, and for their nationally recognized achievements in providing the highest quality transit service. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1356] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING METRO TRANSIT SYSTEM OF THE YEAR ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the dedicated natural resource management professionals at the Chippewa National Forest for their excellent work on the replacement of the Knutson Dam at the outlet of Cass Lake to the Mississippi River. Staff at the national forest and their community partners earned the ``Rise to the Future'' award, one of the U.S. Forest Service's most prestigious awards, for their utilization of a design called Rock Arch Rapids, which allows aquatic wildlife to travel freely between Cass Lake and the Upper Mississippi river. Before the construction of Rock Arch Rapids, the Knutson Dam, a logging dam built in the early 1900's, blocked the passage of fish between Cass Lake and the Mississippi river. Furthermore the dam was at the end of its usable life and required more and more costly repairs each year. The complete replacement of the dilapidated logging dam was a collaboration between Chippewa National Forest, Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe, Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Lessard-Sams Outdoor Heritage Council, Midwest Glacial Lakes Partnership and Ottertail Power Company. The new Rock Arch Rapids not only improves access to Cass Lake for aquatic life but also access to the lake by outdoor enthusiasts, and minimizes erosion of Cass Lake's shoreline to preserve the beautiful campgrounds, trails and beaches of the Chippewa National Forest for years to come.

PETER J. ROSKAM of illinois in the house of representatives Monday, September 26, 2016 Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Sergeant Patricia A. Orisini for her life of service to our country and her strong leadership of the Wounded Warrior Program. As the Program's first director, Sergeant Orisini took a new idea and transformed it into a life-changing opportunity for our nation's veterans. Sergeant Orisini joined the United States Marine Corps in 1975. After 24 years of active duty and a combined three decades of service, she obtained the highest grade of an enlisted Marine--the rank of Master Gunnery Sergeant. She has represented our men and women in uniform through her work with the Department of Veterans Affairs and with the American Legion. Re-called to active duty during Operation Iraqi Freedom, she built and managed a ``medical hold'' program designed to assist injured reservists.

TED POE of texas in the house of representatives Monday, September 26, 2016 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, October 10 is Taiwan's national day-- also known as Double Ten Day. The United States and Taiwan have a strong relationship. Taiwan is a good friend and ally. I congratulate Taiwan on its national day. We also need to be standing by Taiwan and supporting its efforts to be a responsible member of the international community. The International Civil Aviation Organization or ``ICAO'' is a UN agency to ensure the safety of planes that fly around the world. But even though it is less than a week away, there has been no indication that Taiwan will be able to participate in ICAO's 39th Triennial Assembly on September 27. Three years ago, Taiwan was invited by the then-ICAO Council President to attend as a guest, but that invitation was no guarantee that Taiwan could keep attending. Congress passed a law three years ago encouraging ICAO to give Taiwan observer status. Giving Taiwan such status would contribute to the success of ICAO's mission to address aviation security threats through effective international cooperation. As our 9th-largest trading partner in 2015, Taiwan's participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership is a no-brainer. It would boost our trade relationship with Taiwan and would make the overall impact of TPP even better for Americans. To provide greater protection for investors in both countries, we should also work on completing a Bilateral Investment Agreement with Taiwan. In all, trade is an important part of our relationship with Taiwan and I hope my colleagues will join me in advocating for these steps. Again, I wish the people of Taiwan a Happy Double Ten Day. And that's just the way it is. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1357] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TAIWAN NATIONAL DAY ______ HON.

MIKE THOMPSON of california in the house of representatives Monday, September 26, 2016 Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Art Ibleto's lifetime of achievements and generous service to our community upon his 90th birthday. Mr. Ibleto was born in the town of Sesta Godano in Northern Italy on October 2, 1926. As a young man, he fought with resistance groups against Fascism and Nazi Germany. After valiantly serving his home country, Mr. Ibleto immigrated to the United States and decided to settle in Sonoma County in 1949 calling it ``one of the most beautiful places on earth.'' He began working in Sonoma's fields as a vegetable picker, mechanic and truck driver, and soon fell in love with Vicki Ghiradelli whom he married in 1951. The couple soon began to live their own American Dream and bought their first home together in 1961. They developed their own farm soon thereafter to raise hogs, cattle, and potatoes. They later added a Christmas tree farm, a vineyard and real estate on their property. Mr. Ibleto founded the Spaghetti Palace at the Sonoma County Fair as a United Lodges, Sons of Italy project in 1974. What began as a project soon became an institutional landmark. The success of his Spaghetti Palace inspired Mr. Ibleto to pursue a career of supplying locals with his own line of Italian cuisine and catering inspired by traditional Italian methods. Today, Art's booming business is well known throughout California and local residents affectionately refer to him as the ``Pasta King.'' Art is a cook, grape grower, winemaker and a constant source of pride for our community in Sonoma County. In the last few years, Mr. Ibleto's charity pasta feeds have raised over $500,000 to support a wide range of causes from local animal shelters to survivors of a terrible Highway 101 accident. Mr. Speaker, Art Ibleto has not only led a successful career in agriculture, but he has become a culinary and community leader of legendary proportions.

MIKE THOMPSON of california in the house of representatives Monday, September 26, 2016 Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Art Ibleto's lifetime of achievements and generous service to our community upon his 90th birthday. Mr. Ibleto was born in the town of Sesta Godano in Northern Italy on October 2, 1926. As a young man, he fought with resistance groups against Fascism and Nazi Germany. After valiantly serving his home country, Mr. Ibleto immigrated to the United States and decided to settle in Sonoma County in 1949 calling it ``one of the most beautiful places on earth.'' He began working in Sonoma's fields as a vegetable picker, mechanic and truck driver, and soon fell in love with Vicki Ghiradelli whom he married in 1951. The couple soon began to live their own American Dream and bought their first home together in 1961. They developed their own farm soon thereafter to raise hogs, cattle, and potatoes. They later added a Christmas tree farm, a vineyard and real estate on their property. Mr. Ibleto founded the Spaghetti Palace at the Sonoma County Fair as a United Lodges, Sons of Italy project in 1974. What began as a project soon became an institutional landmark. The success of his Spaghetti Palace inspired Mr. Ibleto to pursue a career of supplying locals with his own line of Italian cuisine and catering inspired by traditional Italian methods. Today, Art's booming business is well known throughout California and local residents affectionately refer to him as the ``Pasta King.'' Art is a cook, grape grower, winemaker and a constant source of pride for our community in Sonoma County. In the last few years, Mr. Ibleto's charity pasta feeds have raised over $500,000 to support a wide range of causes from local animal shelters to survivors of a terrible Highway 101 accident. Mr. Speaker, Art Ibleto has not only led a successful career in agriculture, but he has become a culinary and community leader of legendary proportions. He is a true friend of our community and a good friend of mine. Mr. Ibleto's work and philanthropy have left an indelible mark on Sonoma County and California, and it is therefore fitting and proper that we honor him here today. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1357] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING ART IBLETO ______ HON.

I want to wish Stephanie the best as she celebrates her much deserved retirement. While Principal of Myers-Wilkins Elementary, where a majority of students come from households with incomes below the poverty line, Principal Heilig worked tirelessly to engage families and give students the resources they need to learn. As students, teachers, administrators, and principals begin a new school year, one of the biggest issues facing schools is an achievement gap between students from different demographic groups. However, at Myers-Wilkins Elementary Principal Heilig's efforts created an environment where all students, regardless of their background, had an equal opportunity to learn. She was very passionate about fostering a collaboration between the school and the community it serves by setting up after-school programs such as ``family nights.'' During school she would use every available opportunity to give books to students while encouraging them to read. Additionally, she made a point to spend time in the halls of Myers- Wilkins talking to students to learn about their lives outside of school, their struggles and their achievements.

FRANCIS ______ HON. MARCY KAPTUR of ohio in the house of representatives Monday, September 26, 2016 Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a momentous occasion in the life of the Sylvania congregation of the Sisters of St. Francis. The Sylvania Sisters of St. Francis are celebrating their centennial year in 2016 and Saturday September 24, 2016, the Sisters and our community came together in a centennial celebration honoring the Franciscans' 100 years of service in our community. It was Bishop Joseph Schrembs of the Toledo Catholic Diocese who initially requested religious sisters to teach the children of Polish immigrants in Toledo's Catholic Schools. On December 8, 1916, the Sylvania Franciscans were founded as a province of the Sisters of St. Francis in Rochester, Minnesota. The Sisters were stationed at St. Hedwig School in the North End of Toledo and a hub of Polish life in the city. After 89 acres of land was purchased in 1917 through the Rochester community, the Sisters were formally established in Sylvania, Ohio and were known as the Franciscan Sisters of the Immaculate Conception and were led by Mother Adelaide. In the century that followed, the Sylvania Franciscans branched out from their original call to teach the city's Polish immigrant children to sharing the Franciscan presence in ministries spanning health care, housing, human services and pastoral care in addition to education. The Sisters' work is carried forth in eight states and the country of Haiti with 150 Sisters serving our human family. The Sisters' ministries are founded on the ``core values of reverence, service, community, stewardship.'' The Franciscan Sisters are called ``like Francis of Assisi to live the Gospel in joyful servanthood among all people. The Sisters of St. Francis of Sylvania, Ohio, as messengers of peace, commit themselves to works that reverence human dignity, embrace the poor and marginalized, and respect the gift of all creation.'' Living Christ's message described in Matthew 25:40 ``whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.'' The Sylvania Sisters of St. Francis come to their centennial year as an integral part of our community. Their imprimatur is seen everywhere, from the beautiful elegiac campus in Sylvania, to the schools, caring services and hospitals in which they minister, and the Sylvania Franciscan Village which was established to integrate the Sisters' ministries. In addition to traditional ministries, the Sylvania Sisters of St. Francis are leading efforts toward peace and justice and restoring nature. The Sisters note, ``We believe that nature, the arts and culture, and the goodness around us nurture our souls and make us sensitive to Mother Earth and her peoples.'' It is that connection that truly defines the Sisters of St. Francis. A walk on the grounds of the Sisters of St. Francis is to behold the beauty of nature in all of its glory, to hear the silence and to feel God's presence everywhere. From the barracks and strawberry patch Mother Adelaide and the 22 pioneering Sisters first established, the grounds of the Sisters of St. Francis now feature many buildings in which the Sisters live and work, shrines, grottos, a prayer garden, the Portiuncula Chapel and adjacent Lourdes University. Its mission-style buildings showcase stunning mosaics and works of arts crafted by the Sisters themselves. It is truly an oasis of peace and tranquility. St. Francis of Assisi said, ``Preach the Gospel at all times and when necessary use words.'' Throughout their one hundred year history the Sylvania Sisters of St. Francis have lived this truth. Their presence and their good works demonstrate Christ's path and God's deep love. As the Sisters go forth toward their next centennial, let us be mindful of the history, but with a vision for the future. Our community gratefully and enthusiastically joins with them to celebrate the life of this vital and cherished congregation that is the Sylvania Sisters of St. Francis. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1358] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CELEBRATING THE CENTENNIAL OF THE SYLVANIA SISTERS OF ST.

Their imprimatur is seen everywhere, from the beautiful elegiac campus in Sylvania, to the schools, caring services and hospitals in which they minister, and the Sylvania Franciscan Village which was established to integrate the Sisters' ministries. In addition to traditional ministries, the Sylvania Sisters of St. Francis are leading efforts toward peace and justice and restoring nature. The Sisters note, ``We believe that nature, the arts and culture, and the goodness around us nurture our souls and make us sensitive to Mother Earth and her peoples.'' It is that connection that truly defines the Sisters of St. Francis. A walk on the grounds of the Sisters of St. Francis is to behold the beauty of nature in all of its glory, to hear the silence and to feel God's presence everywhere. From the barracks and strawberry patch Mother Adelaide and the 22 pioneering Sisters first established, the grounds of the Sisters of St. Francis now feature many buildings in which the Sisters live and work, shrines, grottos, a prayer garden, the Portiuncula Chapel and adjacent Lourdes University. Its mission-style buildings showcase stunning mosaics and works of arts crafted by the Sisters themselves. It is truly an oasis of peace and tranquility. St. Francis of Assisi said, ``Preach the Gospel at all times and when necessary use words.'' Throughout their one hundred year history the Sylvania Sisters of St. Francis have lived this truth. Their presence and their good works demonstrate Christ's path and God's deep love. As the Sisters go forth toward their next centennial, let us be mindful of the history, but with a vision for the future. Our community gratefully and enthusiastically joins with them to celebrate the life of this vital and cherished congregation that is the Sylvania Sisters of St. Francis. ____________________",package_114_204.csv,4327,4327,4399,"[congressional record volume 162, number 145 (monday, september 26, 2016)] [extensions of remarks] [page e1358] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] celebrating the centennial of the sylvania sisters of st. francis ______ hon. marcy kaptur of ohio in the house of representatives monday, september 26, 2016 ms. kaptur. mr. speaker, i rise today to recognize a momentous occasion in the life of the sylvania congregation of the sisters of st. francis. the sylvania sisters of st. francis are celebrating their centennial year in 2016 and saturday september 24, 2016, the sisters and our community came together in a centennial celebration honoring the franciscans' 100 years of service in our community. it was bishop joseph schrembs of the toledo catholic diocese who initially requested religious sisters to teach the children of polish immigrants in toledo's catholic schools. on december 8, 1916, the sylvania franciscans were founded as a province of the sisters of st. francis in rochester, minnesota. the sisters were stationed at st. hedwig school in the north end of toledo and a hub of polish life in the city. after 89 acres of land was purchased in 1917 through the rochester community, the sisters were formally established in sylvania, ohio and were known as the franciscan sisters of the immaculate conception and were led by mother adelaide. in the century that followed, the sylvania franciscans branched out from their original call to teach the city's polish immigrant children to sharing the franciscan presence in ministries spanning health care, housing, human services and pastoral care in addition to education. the sisters' work is carried forth in eight states and the country of haiti with 150 sisters serving our human family. the sisters' ministries are founded on the ``core values of reverence, service, community, stewardship.'' the franciscan sisters are called ``like francis of assisi to live the gospel in joyful servanthood among all people. the sisters of st. francis of sylvania, ohio, as messengers of peace, commit themselves to works that reverence human dignity, embrace the poor and marginalized, and respect the gift of all creation.'' living christ's message described in matthew 25:40 ``whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.'' the sylvania sisters of st. francis come to their centennial year as an integral part of our community. their imprimatur is seen everywhere, from the beautiful elegiac campus in sylvania, to the schools, caring services and hospitals in which they minister, and the sylvania franciscan village which was established to integrate the sisters' ministries. in addition to traditional ministries, the sylvania sisters of st. francis are leading efforts toward peace and justice and restoring nature. the sisters note, ``we believe that nature, the arts and culture, and the goodness around us nurture our souls and make us sensitive to mother earth and her peoples.'' it is that connection that truly defines the sisters of st. francis. a walk on the grounds of the sisters of st. francis is to behold the beauty of nature in all of its glory, to hear the silence and to feel god's presence everywhere. from the barracks and strawberry patch mother adelaide and the 22 pioneering sisters first established, the grounds of the sisters of st. francis now feature many buildings in which the sisters live and work, shrines, grottos, a prayer garden, the portiuncula chapel and adjacent lourdes university. its mission-style buildings showcase stunning mosaics and works of arts crafted by the sisters themselves. it is truly an oasis of peace and tranquility. st. francis of assisi said, ``preach the gospel at all times and when necessary use words.'' throughout their one hundred year history the sylvania sisters of st. francis have lived this truth. their presence and their good works demonstrate christ's path and god's deep love. as the sisters go forth toward their next centennial, let us be mindful of the history, but with a vision for the future. our community gratefully and enthusiastically joins with them to celebrate the life of this vital and cherished congregation that is the sylvania sisters of st. francis. ____________________",4327

TED POE of texas in the house of representatives Monday, September 26, 2016 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, back in 2012, the President told the American people that al-Qaeda was ``decimated.'' Two years later, the President touted U.S. success in ``taking out terrorists who threaten us'' in places like Somalia and Yemen, both countries with strong and active al-Qaeda branches. Look at those countries now: Somalia's al- Shabaab continues its terror campaign against Somali and AMISOM troops, and Yemen's rebel conflict has breathed new life into al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). The problem with this Administration's assertions of success is that they fundamentally misunderstood al-Qaeda's strategy in light of the loud-mouthed tactics of its terrorist spinoff, ISIS. The two terrorist organizations seek the same end goal: the establishment of an Islamic state where only their strict interpretation of Islamic law is tolerated. However, ISIS and al-Qaeda disagree on the means to reach that end. Al-Qaeda's leaders and ideologues, including Osama bin Laden, have always advocated playing the long game: embedding itself in local populations, building relationships, and even allying with enemies and rivals in order to achieve their goals. Winning over the hearts and minds of local Muslim populations has always been the priority for al- Qaeda. ISIS, on the other hand, believes that the establishment of the caliphate is the supreme priority, judging that force--instead of persuasion--can garner the loyalty of local communities. While ISIS was busy conquering vast swaths of land in Syria and Iraq, al-Qaeda was not simply sitting back and watching dejectedly. It was entrenching itself throughout the Middle East, in Yemen, Syria, Libya and Tunisia. Al-Qaeda leaders, while fundamentally disagreeing with ISIS' establishment of a caliphate on Islamic legal grounds, also criticized what they saw as ISIS overstretching its resources. They were busy readying the grounds for ISIS' inevitable collapse and al- Qaeda's return to the spotlight. Unfortunately, the Administration misunderstands this. While focusing all of our attention on ISIS, we have overlooked al-Qaeda and dismissed it as defeated. This is exactly what al-Qaeda wants: the breathing room to grow stronger along with the optics of appearing more moderate to its extremist Muslim base than ISIS. Once ISIS loses all its territory in Iraq and Syria, as well as its fast shrinking base in Libya, it will be left with nothing but a band of sympathizers and a radical ideology. Al-Qaeda however will have developed deep ties to local communities throughout the region, strengthened its operational capabilities, and emerge more dangerous than ever. Success against ISIS should only be judged in the context of the global war on terror. Partial success in one battlefield and total failure in another will not be enough to ensure the security of our homeland. We must go after al-Qaeda now more than ever before it is too late. And that's just the way it is. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1359] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] OVERLOOKING AL-QAEDA ______ HON.

TED POE of texas in the house of representatives Monday, September 26, 2016 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, as China's economic might has grown over the past 30 years, so too has its military prowess. And while many are concerned about China's aggressive behavior in the South China Sea, we must not forget about the threat they pose to nuclear security. Since 1987 China has increased its military expenditures fivefold. Their military muscle includes upwards of 260 nuclear warheads and roughly 60 nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), not to mention an upgraded ballistic missile delivery system. China may have joined the IAEA and be party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, but actions speak louder than words and China has a history of supplying nuclear technology to countries of proliferation concern. We know that in the past China handed over design instructions, including information on warhead design, and fissile material to assist the Pakistanis in the development of their nuclear weapons. Even more recently it was discovered that Pakistan has a new 2,750km range Shaheen III nuclear ballistic missile that was carried on a 16-wheel transporter erector launcher or TEL for short. Pakistan's Shaheen III TEL is uncannily similar to the ones created by the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation and a Chinese provided TEL to North Korea's new KN-08 ICBM. If Pakistan's new TEL was acquired from China this demonstrates a highly concerning level of cooperation between the two governments that could directly threaten U.S. national security. Pakistan alone is a dangerous bedfellow, but if China has thrown its weight behind the government in Islamabad we need to remain on high alert for exchanges of sensitive nuclear information. To compound this threat to nuclear nonproliferation, China's most infamous client and partner in Communism is its neighbor to the east, North Korea. Pyongyang is estimated to have enough plutonium for a dozen nuclear weapons, and it is thought to be continuously producing highly enriched uranium. North Korea has conducted four nuclear tests and numerous test-fires of ballistic missiles, including intercontinental and submarine-launched missiles. The missile launchers used in these tests were made directly from Chinese designs. In the aftermath of North Korea's belligerent actions, China never fails to articulate its ``disappointment'' in its neighbor. But this connection between North Korea's nuclear missile capability and the Chinese government shows that what China says publically is fundamentally at odds with its real goals. China never backs up this ``disappointment'' with real action knowing full well that China is the only country that wields any sort of influence over the DPRK. China refuses to stringently enforce sanctions aimed at curbing North Korea's nuclear program and since China accounts for 70 percent of North Korea's trade volume, these sanctions have little impact without Beijing's enforcement. When it comes down to it, the Chinese government is essentially allowing a dangerous nuclear state to conduct tests unchecked. China's danger to the nuclear nonproliferation regime cannot go unnoticed. Given China's emerging military power, we must be even more wary of China's actions in the nuclear field. For the sake of our national security we cannot afford to have the state-run communist country pull the wool over our eyes. And that's just the way it is. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1360] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CHINESE PROLIFERATION THREAT ______ HON.

North Korea has conducted four nuclear tests and numerous test-fires of ballistic missiles, including intercontinental and submarine-launched missiles. The missile launchers used in these tests were made directly from Chinese designs. In the aftermath of North Korea's belligerent actions, China never fails to articulate its ``disappointment'' in its neighbor. But this connection between North Korea's nuclear missile capability and the Chinese government shows that what China says publically is fundamentally at odds with its real goals. China never backs up this ``disappointment'' with real action knowing full well that China is the only country that wields any sort of influence over the DPRK. China refuses to stringently enforce sanctions aimed at curbing North Korea's nuclear program and since China accounts for 70 percent of North Korea's trade volume, these sanctions have little impact without Beijing's enforcement. When it comes down to it, the Chinese government is essentially allowing a dangerous nuclear state to conduct tests unchecked. China's danger to the nuclear nonproliferation regime cannot go unnoticed. Given China's emerging military power, we must be even more wary of China's actions in the nuclear field. For the sake of our national security we cannot afford to have the state-run communist country pull the wool over our eyes. And that's just the way it is. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1360] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CHINESE PROLIFERATION THREAT ______ HON. TED POE of texas in the house of representatives Monday, September 26, 2016 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, as China's economic might has grown over the past 30 years, so too has its military prowess. And while many are concerned about China's aggressive behavior in the South China Sea, we must not forget about the threat they pose to nuclear security. Since 1987 China has increased its military expenditures fivefold. Their military muscle includes upwards of 260 nuclear warheads and roughly 60 nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), not to mention an upgraded ballistic missile delivery system. China may have joined the IAEA and be party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, but actions speak louder than words and China has a history of supplying nuclear technology to countries of proliferation concern. We know that in the past China handed over design instructions, including information on warhead design, and fissile material to assist the Pakistanis in the development of their nuclear weapons. Even more recently it was discovered that Pakistan has a new 2,750km range Shaheen III nuclear ballistic missile that was carried on a 16-wheel transporter erector launcher or TEL for short. Pakistan's Shaheen III TEL is uncannily similar to the ones created by the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation and a Chinese provided TEL to North Korea's new KN-08 ICBM. If Pakistan's new TEL was acquired from China this demonstrates a highly concerning level of cooperation between the two governments that could directly threaten U.S. national security. Pakistan alone is a dangerous bedfellow, but if China has thrown its weight behind the government in Islamabad we need to remain on high alert for exchanges of sensitive nuclear information. To compound this threat to nuclear nonproliferation, China's most infamous client and partner in Communism is its neighbor to the east, North Korea. Pyongyang is estimated to have enough plutonium for a dozen nuclear weapons, and it is thought to be continuously producing highly enriched uranium. North Korea has conducted four nuclear tests and numerous test-fires of ballistic missiles, including intercontinental and submarine-launched missiles.

CAROLYN B. MALONEY of new york in the house of representatives Monday, September 26, 2016 Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise to introduce a Concurrent Resolution expressing the sense of Congress that the Parthenon Marbles, currently held in the British Museum, should be returned to Greece. Approximately 200 years ago, while Greece was under Ottoman rule, the British nobleman Thomas Bruce, seventh Earl of Elgin removed over 100 pieces of sculptures known as the Parthenon Marbles and transported them to the United Kingdom. The Marbles were part of a frieze that adorned the Temple of Athena. In 1816, the British Parliament voted to purchase the Marbles from Lord Elgin and they now reside in the British Museum. The other half of the Marbles that comprise the frieze are in the New Acropolis Museum in Athens alongside plaster replicas of the Marbles that were taken. Despite years of efforts by the Greek Government to retain the Marbles, it has been unable to negotiate an agreement with its British counterparts to return the Marbles to Greece. I am pleased that Members of the British Parliament have recently introduced legislation to transfer ownership of the Marbles back to Greece and return these cherished artifacts to their rightful home. The Parthenon marbles [[Page E1361]] are some of Greece's greatest examples of artistic expression and beauty, and should be on display in their country of origin. They are vital pieces of Greek history that belong to the Greek people. This resolution calls upon the two countries to come to an agreement to finally return these treasures to their rightful home. I want to thank Rep. Gus Bilirakis, with whom I co-chair the Congressional Caucus on Hellenic Issues, and Rep. Donald Payne, Jr. for joining me as co-sponsors on this important resolution. Rep. Payne's father and our former colleague, the late Rep. Donald Payne Sr., was a great champion in this effort to return the Parthenon Marbles to Greece. I am proud to continue to call for an agreement that will put an end to this centuries-old dispute, and urge my colleagues to support this resolution. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1360-E1361] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT THE PARTHENON MARBLES SHOULD BE RETURNED TO GREECE ______ HON.

RICHARD M. NOLAN of minnesota in the house of representatives Monday, September 26, 2016 Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Sheila Ross, a two- time lung cancer survivor who has devoted her entire career to public service and advancing better outcomes for those affected by lung cancer. I wish to pay special tribute to Sheila in light of her pending retirement at the end of the 114th Congress from the Lung Cancer Alliance, a non-profit guided by Sheila's unstoppable and indefatigable force to support anyone diagnosed with lung cancer. The organization provides patients with information and guidance and advocates for advanced life-saving research for the lung cancer community. It has been said that Sheila is the founder of the ``lung cancer movement,'' the first advocate ever to elevate her voice and walk the halls of Congress to bring attention to a public health imperative and to demand a more coordinated and compassionate response to the leading cause of cancer death. [[Page E1362]] After her initial cancer diagnosis in 1999 and then again in 2000, Sheila quickly grasped that public health policy must be linked to science. With the sheer force of will and survivorship, Sheila set in motion actions that history will look back upon as seminal moments in the battle to end lung cancer as we know it. Sheila's strategic expertise developed from 20 years of legislative and management experience on Capitol Hill as a Chief of Staff in both House and the Senate offices for Democrats and Republicans. After her career in Congress she spearheaded the creation of Lung Cancer Alliance, which today stands as the highest-rated and only national non-profit organization devoted entirely to supporting the lung cancer community and elevating awareness, changing health policy and advancing research. The group has been an invaluable partner ever since my colleagues Frank LoBiondo, Lois Capps and I created the first-ever Lung Cancer Caucus. While at the Alliance, Sheila can be credited with organizing the first-ever bipartisan and bicameral resolutions focusing on lung cancer, as well as the original Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act, requiring the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to give increased focus and funding to lung cancer early detection and research. Additionally, Sheila worked to establish the first and only dedicated lung cancer research pipeline within the Department of Defense Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program, she urged the Department of Veterans Affairs to swiftly implement a national screening program, expanded access to low dose CT scanning which detects lung cancer early on, and monitored NCI's National Lung Screening Trial which concluded ahead of schedule when the trial's goal was achieved earlier than expected. She also worked to secure Medicare coverage for CT screening for seniors and the disabled and established the only patient-powered CT scan donation program, Give A Scan, that allows those impacted to contribute directly to research. Sheila's contributions to better the lives of those living with and at risk for lung cancer will forever be remembered. When the defeat of lung cancer finally enters the annals of history--and it will--Sheila Ross's fearless advocacy will be included in the early pages of that historical document. I want to thank Sheila Ross and wish her all the best in a well- deserved retirement. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1361-E1362] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE FOUNDER OF THE ``LUNG CANCER MOVEMENT'' ______ HON.

ADAM SMITH of washington in the house of representatives Monday, September 26, 2016 Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Bill and Paula Clapp as they are honored with the Inspiring Global Leaders Award from the Washington Office of Latin America (WOLA). This award is given in recognition of their years of indispensable leadership on global development and philanthropy for the past quarter century. Bill Clapp, an accomplished Seattle businessperson with more than thirty years of experience running a variety of companies in the Pacific Northwest, Alaska, and Hawaii, decided in the 1990s that he wanted to do more to make an impact globally. This decision resulted in the foundation of a series of impactful organizations that Bill and Paula Clapp had a hand in creating. Bill has served as President and Co-Founder of the Seattle International Foundation, a preeminent non- government organization (NGO) focused on poverty reduction and women's empowerment in Central America. Bill and Paula Clapp co-founded another NGO, Global Partnerships, in 1994 after witnessing the need for targeted and sustainable investments in Central America. Since 2001, Global Partnerships has impacted 3.3 million lives in thirteen countries in Latin America and the Caribbean through its unique social enterprise model. In 2015 alone, the organization invested $35.7 million to deliver economic opportunities to over 600,000 individuals. Global Partnerships continues to be the largest microfinancing organization for Latin America in Seattle. Bill and Paula also helped to create Global Washington in 2008, a consortium of NGOs that promotes and supports its members who are working to reduce poverty and disease, increase access to health care and education, protect the environment, and strengthen economies. Global Washington is the only organization in Washington state that builds networks between private companies and nonprofits working in global development, leading to partnerships that result in innovative, impactful projects around the world. Following Bill Clapp's retirement from Matthew G. Norton Co. in 2002, he co-founded the Initiative for Global Development. In addition to serving on the boards of Weyerhaeuser and Alaska Airlines, he has also served on several community and nonprofit boards, and has been actively involved as an early investor in micro-finance development. Bill has also served on many industry panels and advisory committees, speaking widely on development issues around the world and in Congress. Paula Clapp has been an active leader throughout the years, as well. She played a central role in the creation of an acclaimed documentary film ``SOLD'' which raised awareness about sex trafficking. She and a group of Seattle women co-founded Stolen-Youth, a non-profit organization that raises awareness and funds to help rescue and recover local youth who are forced into prostitution. Paula was also a founding member of the Washington Women's Foundation and has served on the boards of the Make A Wish Foundation, One World Now, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2014, Paula received the Unsung Heroes of Compassion award from His Holiness the Dalai Lama. Throughout the past twenty-four years, Bill and Paula Clapp have remained steadfast in their belief that international development serves our national interests and improves all aspects of our society. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I recognize and congratulate Bill and Paula Clapp for their contributions and leadership in the global development sector, and the impact they have made in the lives of countless individuals and families around the world for over twenty-four years. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1362] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING BILL AND PAULA CLAPP, RECIPIENTS OF THE GLOBAL LEADERS AWARD ______ HON.

DAVID SCOTT of georgia in the house of representatives Monday, September 26, 2016 Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the renowned, award-winning Atlanta Voice newspaper. Founded in 1966 by J. Lowell Ware and Ed Clayton, the Atlanta Voice has provided an enduring channel for news in Atlanta's African-American community. The Atlanta Voice's Founder and Publisher J. Lowell Ware was a native Georgian who developed an interest in journalism in high school when he took a part-time job at the Birmingham Alabama Mirror. He later earned a B.A. in printing and journalism from Alabama A&M University and completed a tour with the U.S. Army before returning back to Atlanta to launch a weekly newspaper with journalist Ed Clayton. Ware and Clayton started the Atlanta Voice to provide fair and credible coverage of the Civil Rights Movement, which was heating up in the South with increasing student sit-ins and activities of the Southern Christian Leadership [[Page E1363]] Council. Under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, members of the press should enjoy protected rights to publish information and opinions without interference or reprisal from the American government. The Atlanta Voice was founded at a time, however, when these rights were not universally shared. The newspaper's African-American publishers faced threats to their lives and property simply for exercising their First Amendment rights to provide accurate coverage of the Movement. Ware recounted years later, ``We got a lot of threats, but we didn't stop publishing.'' Living by their motto, ``A People Without a Voice Cannot Be Heard,'' the Atlanta Voice has endured and recorded 50 historic years of social, political and economic changes in the African-American community in Atlanta. And the Atlanta Voice continues to serve, with courage and integrity, as a beacon of journalistic hope for the entire African- American community, regardless of age, income or socioeconomic status. Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring the Atlanta Voice on this momentous anniversary. I rise today to celebrate a newspaper that has been an informative news source for so many Georgians, and I ask my colleagues to join me in commemorating the newspaper's 50th anniversary and continued service to the Greater Atlanta community. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1362-E1363] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CELEBRATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ATLANTA VOICE ______ HON.

LUTHER ALMER ``JACK'' BEARDEN ______ HON. ERIC A. ``RICK'' CRAWFORD of arkansas in the house of representatives Monday, September 26, 2016 Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, today I recognize the 100th birthday of Mr. Luther Almer ``Jack'' Bearden, who was born on September 8, 1916. The youngest child of Charles Luther and Addie Mae Wallace Bearden, Luther Almer became ``Jack'' as a young boy when he took water to the cotton fields as a ``water jack.'' The name has stuck with him for almost a century. Born in Boydsville, Arkansas, Jack grew up during the Great Depression chopping and picking cotton by hand. By the age of 16, Jack would surrender his life to Christ, changing the course of his life forever. Four years later, he met 16-year-old Martha Geneva Bateman, whom would become his wife of 75 years. Throughout the many years of their marriage, they would serve God in church, visiting the sick, Women's Associations, and Men's Brotherhood events. In 1942, Jack gave his first sermon, ``Ye Must Be Born Again'' from John 3:7 at Boydsville Baptist Church. In his 73 years as a preacher, Jack started five mission churches and pastored 25 churches in Northeast Arkansas and Missouri. To support his family while pastoring, Jack held a multitude of occupations throughout his life. He was a cistern digger, carpenter, cotton picker, cotton chopper, song leader, pianist, and temporarily ran a store. He is an inspiration to all those who have the opportunity to meet him. Jack and his late wife Geneva were blessed with three daughters, one of whom passed away at birth, and a son who passed on to heaven in 1998. They were also blessed with 10 grandchildren, 23 great- grandchildren, and 5 great-great grandchildren. I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to the lifetime of achievements of Mr. Bearden and to wish him all the very best. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1363] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE 100TH BIRTHDAY OF MR.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the Boys & Girls Club of Springfield, Massachusetts as they celebrate their 125th anniversary. The Boys & Girls Clubs of America is an outstanding organization founded to provide after school programs to children, especially in areas most in need. The Springfield Boys & Girls Club opened its doors in 1891 with a mission to provide a safe environment and the resources for the children of Springfield. Their ultimate goal has always been to ensure that these children become respectful members of society. Springfield has changed a great deal since the Boys & Girls Club opened. Through all of the changes and challenges in the community, the Boys & Girls Club has remained a place where kids can gain confidence and make friends where otherwise they couldn't. Today, the Boys & Girls Club offers a wide variety of opportunities such as swim lessons, math- and-literacy tutoring, digital art lessons, and many more. They provide all of these services with the lowest membership rates in Massachusetts for after school programs. They have even started to have programs and events on Saturdays. Mr. Speaker, throughout my tenure as Springfield's mayor and representing Springfield in Congress for the past 28 years, I have seen firsthand what the Boys & Girls Club has accomplished for the community. With the continued support of its many benefactors as well as the support of the federal and state governments, I am sure that they will continue to contribute to children's lives for generations to come.

MARK DeSAULNIER of california in the house of representatives Monday, September 26, 2016 Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and service of Richard ``Dick'' Allen. Dick dedicated his life to educating and empowering California's youth. Through his 41 years of service as a teacher, principal, and district administrator, Dick touched the lives of thousands of students through his leadership and deep affection for his students. As you may know, Dick spent the first decade of his career in the classroom, followed by a transition to the administrative team where he rose from Vice Principal to Director of Elementary Education and ultimately retired in 1997 as the Director of Continuing Education. After retiring, Dick was elected to the Board of Education to continue his dedication to public service. Included among his many accomplishments in service to the Bay Area are graduating 2,298 students, opening technology centers, expanding tutoring and mentoring services. He also helped implement a classroom for a language lab, fought to replace playground equipment, and began districtwide training in emergency preparation and crisis management. During his tenure, Walnut Acres Elementary was named a Federal No Child Left Behind Blue Ribbon School, the Board of Education received a California Council for Adult Education's ``Friend of Education'' award, and improved test scores at almost all grade levels. In addition to his role in our schools, Dick was a District Delegate to the California School Board Association, a Chair-elect of the Concord Chamber of Commerce, a Court Appointed Special Advocate on the Board of Directors, and a foster child educational advocate. Dick's long and decorated career is a testament to his values and dedication to education. I am saddened to hear of his passing, but his legacy will live on in Contra Costa County. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1364] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF RICHARD ALLEN ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Ida Mehlmann of Griswold, Iowa, on the celebration of her 100th birthday on September 4, 2016. Ida celebrates this special day with her twin brother, Ira Spieker, who lives in Michigan. Ida resides at the Griswold Care Center in Griswold, Iowa, and enjoys embroidering and working on puzzles. Ida tells her friends of her simple philosophy: she takes life day by day and tends to do whatever she wants to do. Ida and her late husband, LeRoy, were married on March 8, 1939 at the Atlantic Methodist Church parsonage. They had six children including twin daughters. Ida was born and raised on a farm, helped with the daily chores of farm life growing up, and later married a farmer. She said she has seen many changes throughout her life, but the biggest change was having access to electricity. Ida is also known for her baking skills and her famous sour cream raisin pie. Her talent in the kitchen has given her the reputation as one of the best pie makers in southwest Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I am honored and pleased to congratulate Ida Mehlmann on her 100th birthday.

DEBBIE DINGELL of michigan in the house of representatives Monday, September 26, 2016 Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 35th anniversary of Athena International. Athena International strives to create balance in leadership worldwide by seeking to encourage, educate, and support our next generation of female leaders. Its roots trace back to Michigan where it began as a local program, and it has grown into a global movement, serving to inspire female leaders both domestically and throughout the globe. Founded in 1982 by Martha Mertz, Athena International began as a small non-profit organization in Lansing, Michigan. Recognizing a need for stronger female leadership in her business community, Mertz launched the Athena Award program. This award would go to individuals who not only excelled at their professions, but who also gave back to their communities and helped motivate others in their communities to lead, particularly women. Additionally, the organization developed the Athena Leadership Model, a program seeking to best prepare women to be successful leaders. This model identifies eight distinct attributes for women in leadership: Authentic Self, Relationships, Giving Back, Collaboration, Courageous Acts, Learning, Fierce Advocacy, Celebration and Joy. These personal traits are intuitive for women, and when paired with traditional leadership characteristics, prepare them to become leaders. Martha Mertz's vision has become a global movement. There have now been over 7,000 recipients of the Athena Award, with these awards presented in 500 communities throughout 8 countries. The organization continues to provide awards to individuals who empower women and best position them to become our future leaders, and provides an annual leadership forum and luncheon for female leaders to make meaningful connections with one another. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the Athena International Organization. Their commitment to preparing our future leaders deserves praise, and we wish them many more years of success and prosperity. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 145 (Monday, September 26, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1364] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF THE 35TH ANNIVERSARY OF ATHENA INTERNATIONAL ______ HON.

DAVID YOUNG of iowa in the house of representatives Monday, September 26, 2016 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Gary Herrick of Van Meter, Iowa, for his 40 years of service to the Van Meter Fire Department. Mr. Herrick recently retired from the department after four decades of service to the community of Van Meter. Throughout his tenure he has held every rank in the department, including chief, and has been an invaluable source of information for all other members of the fire department. His vast experience not only helped train fellow firefighters on how to best fight fires and rescue people, but also how to show compassion to victims, and how to interact with the community. Current Fire Chief Jon Bruen told the Dallas County News that Mr. Herrick has been a mentor to him during his years on the department.
