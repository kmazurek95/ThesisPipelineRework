CREC-2016-09-29-pt1-PgS6251-7,CREC-2016-09-29,114,THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESS,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6251-S6252] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESS Mr. REID. Mr. President, in this Republican Congress--especially as we head out for yet another unearned recess--I feel compelled to comment on how Republicans have treated the President of the United States during the last 8 years. History will look back and note that the Republicans in Congress treated President Obama with unprecedented disrespect. No one expected them to agree with everything that he did or tried to do, but Americans deserve better than the way Republicans behaved toward President Obama. A day or two after President Obama was elected the first time, Republicans met here in Washington--all the Republican big names--and they came to two conclusions. No. 1, Obama would not be reelected. They failed on that one quite miserably. But No. 2, they would oppose everything that President Obama tried to do, and they have stuck by that without any question. America would be better off with a responsible opposition party that found a way to make its differences with President Obama clear without treating him with such contempt. But, sadly, that is not what they saw from Republicans over the past 8 years. President Obama is the first President to be denied a hearing on his budget. He is the first President to be denied a hearing on a Supreme Court nominee. President Obama is the first President to be asked to show his birth certificate. President Obama is the first President who has faced over 500 filibusters here in the Senate. In this Republican Senate, President Obama will see fewer nominations confirmed than any President in many, many decades. Republicans have not done their basic work of government, and they have not stood by their commitments to restore regular order or to pass a budget. Republicans have spent their time doing everything in their power to discredit President Obama and empower Donald Trump. That is not a legacy that any Senator should be proud of. I listened to public radio this morning, and the Arizona Republic, from the big city of Phoenix, right next to Nevada, for the first time in its history of more than 120 years--for the first time in its history--endorsed a Democratic Presidential nominee. It had never been done before. It is a Republican newspaper. I listened to the editor of the newspaper on the radio this morning saying they couldn't. Why? Because of Donald Trump. The legacy of Donald Trump should not be anything the Republicans are proud of. The only thing Republicans have done this year was to prove that they are the party of Trump. They are the party of Trump. They say they are not the party of Trump, but they are. They would have us believe that Trump just fell out of the sky and somehow mysteriously became the nominee of the party, but that is not the way it is. Everything he has said, stood for, done in this bizarre campaign he has run has come, filtered up, from what has gone on here in the Republican Senate--disagreeing with everything--anything--President Obama wanted. [[Page S6252]] They filibustered things they agreed with just to slow things down. Trump is no anomaly. He is the monster the Republicans built. He is their Frankenstein monster. They own him. All we have to do to see that the Republicans are the party of Trump is to look at the way they have treated President Obama. He is a good man, a good family man. He has a great education. He is a good communicator. He has written two best-selling books. Everyone knows he can communicate orally. He deserved better than the unprecedented disrespect the Republicans have shown toward him. America, which twice elected Barack Obama to be its President, deserves better--much, much better. It is a shame what has not been done, and it is a shame what has been done. Mr. President, I note that my friend the Republican leader is not here. I will suggest the absence of a quorum, and the Chair can announce the business of the day following his appearance here. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6251-S6252] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESS Mr. REID.

CREC-2016-09-29-pt1-PgS6252-4,CREC-2016-09-29,114,TRIBUTE TO DALLAS POLICE CHIEF DAVID BROWN,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S6252] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO DALLAS POLICE CHIEF DAVID BROWN Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I want to start today by offering a word of gratitude to retiring Dallas police chief David Brown, who will retire from his long career of public service this Tuesday. Chief Brown became the face of a terrible tragedy that occurred in Texas a few weeks ago when five police officers were gunned down in cold blood. Frankly, I had many colleagues and other people whom I have run into ask me about him because he made such a positive impression with his calmness under difficult circumstances and his leadership qualities. The incident occurred last July when 12 law enforcement officers were shot, and 5 were killed. I remember attending the memorial service with President Obama and the First Lady, as well as President George W. Bush and Laura Bush, and the chief spoke then along with Mayor Rawlings. I can't tell you how grateful I am that, at a time when people think Washington has lost its way, we still have strong, articulate, compassionate leaders like Chief Brown and Mayor Rawlings. Chief Brown is retiring after 33 years of service to the Dallas police force. As a result of the attention he got from all of the publicity surrounding this terrible tragedy in July, the chief became a little bit of a folk hero, I guess, and people began to listen to what he had to say about a lot of different things. One of the things he would like to say is ``Dallas loves.'' He made that a bit of a rallying cry following the attack. His actions in the aftermath of that tragedy certainly demonstrated his belief in that statement. Of course, while many Americans know Chief Brown from his leadership during the shooting in July, Dallasites have benefited from his service for a long time. He grew up in Oak Cliff in southwest Dallas and has been on the Dallas police force for the last 33 years. I know the people of Dallas will miss his leadership and hearing him sing a little Stevie Wonder from time to time. I want to express my gratitude and thanks to Chief Brown and wish him well in the next chapter of his life. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S6252] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO DALLAS POLICE CHIEF DAVID BROWN Mr. CORNYN.

Mr. President, before the Senate adjourns this afternoon, I want to remind my colleagues that National Domestic Violence Awareness Month begins on Saturday. Throughout the month of October, we are called to increase public awareness and understanding of domestic violence. As noted by the National Network to End Domestic Violence, domestic violence thrives when we remain silent. That is why I recently introduced a resolution to commemorate National Domestic Violence Awareness Month. As stated in our resolution, Congress should continue to raise awareness of domestic violence in the United States. We also should pledge our continued support for programs designed to assist survivors, hold perpetrators accountable, and bring an end to domestic violence. I thank my colleagues, Senators Leahy, Ayotte, and Klobuchar, for joining as original cosponsors of the resolution. It passed the Senate unanimously on September 15. Through the enactment of other key measures--such as the Violence Against Women Act, the Family Violence Prevention Act, and the Victims of Crime Act--Congress has made support to survivors a national priority for over three decades. Through the enactment of laws criminalizing domestic violence at the State and local level, we also have sent a strong signal to abusers that domestic violence is not a private matter, but a public issue. We have come a long way, but our work is far from complete. Even now, domestic violence affects more than 12 million people each year in the United States, including women, men, and children of every age and socioeconomic status. Research also suggests that young women between the ages of 18 and 34 are particularly vulnerable to domestic violence. The negative effects of this crime go far beyond the confines of individual households. It impacts our communities when the victims of domestic violence are forced to choose between continued abuse or financial insecurity and even homelessness. It impacts our economy when the victims of this crime miss work and school. Thankfully, there are many individuals and organizations in Iowa and elsewhere around the country that work around the clock to meet the needs of victims. They include the crisis hotline personnel who provide peer-to-peer support or counseling to victims across the Nation. They include the staff and volunteers at shelters, who provide safe havens for victims fleeing abuse in communities. They include the advocates who champion prevention initiatives and resources for victims at the State and Federal levels. Last, but certainly not least, they include the first responders who compassionately respond to victims of domestic violence in their most vulnerable moments. These men and women put their lives at risk when responding to domestic abuse calls, which can be among the most volatile they will experience. We thank them for their never-ending service. Mr. President, once again, I thank my colleagues for passing this resolution unanimously. It is important that we continue to support the goals and ideals of National Domestic Violence Awareness Month. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S6254] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NATIONAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH Mr. GRASSLEY.

CREC-2016-09-29-pt1-PgS6252-5,CREC-2016-09-29,114,CONTINUING RESOLUTION AND SENATE ACCOMPLISHMENTS,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6252-S6254] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONTINUING RESOLUTION AND SENATE ACCOMPLISHMENTS Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, yesterday we finally were able to move legislation forward that would keep the lights on here in Washington, at least until December, and provided very important relief that I want to emphasize. There is flood relief for States like Texas, but not just Texas-- Maryland, West Virginia, Louisiana, and Iowa, all of which will benefit from the flood relief that is provided for in this continuing resolution that was passed yesterday and was passed by the House as well. More importantly, perhaps, is the support for veterans programs and military construction. It is important that we pass legislation to meet our responsibilities to support our men and women in uniform wherever they may be serving, whether here at home or abroad. Thanks to the leadership of the Senator from Ohio and the Senator from New Hampshire, we passed legislation that will provide additional funds to deal with the opioid epidemic that is ravaging many parts of our country. As a medical doctor, the Presiding Officer knows that people unfortunately get hooked on opioid prescription drugs. Frequently, when that runs out, they often opt for cheaper, more plentiful heroin, which, when mixed with other ingredients such as fentanyl, makes it even more deadly and more likely that they will overdose with the use of this heroin laced with fentanyl. We have provided additional funds in this continuing resolution to deal with that. Finally, but very significantly, we also were able to break the impasse over funding for Zika. As we have come to learn, Zika is a mosquito-borne virus that has the potential of causing terrible birth defects in children. We have seen pictures of children with shrunken skulls from the microcephaly caused by this terrible mosquito-borne virus. We had been trying since last May to get that Zika funding done. For some reason, even though the amount of the funding, $1.1 billion, was agreed upon, our Democratic colleagues wouldn't take yes for an answer. Finally, yesterday, they decided to give up their filibuster and allow this legislation and this important funding to be done. My point is that we could have done this a long time ago. In fact, we wouldn't have had to pass the continuing resolution taking us over to December--just 10 weeks from now, when we will have to start all over again--if it weren't for the obstructionism and filibustering of our Democratic colleagues. Of course, the cause of this is a fight over Federal spending. We know there are caps on discretionary spending, and many of our Members, myself included, have become very concerned in this very dangerous world we live in that we have shortchanged our military and our national security support. So in order to get additional spending for our troops abroad and at home and to make sure that we are prepared for the next threat to our country, we increased spending for the Department of Defense, but the costs of doing that were increases in nondefense discretionary spending. Thus we get back into the same old fight, which unfortunately has left us $19 trillion in debt, where spending is simply out of control. That is the reason we ended up in this posture. It is highly regrettable. [[Page S6253]] Nobody would have chosen this--certainly I wouldn't have--as a first option. Now we are going to be confronted with the responsibility in December of passing appropriations bills that will take us through the next year, through the end of the fiscal year. So we have this resolution taken care of. It is behind us now, and that looms large ahead of us. I want to mention some of the good work being done in Texas by folks like the Harris County Mosquito & Vector Control unit. A few weeks ago, I had a chance to go on the rounds with them and set some of the traps for various mosquitoes. Actually, I got this idea from listening to Mike Rowe, who has this ``Dirty Jobs'' series, and I noticed one of them happened to be mosquito control. It occurred to me that maybe there was something for me to learn about how local leaders like those in Harris County identify these mosquitoes that bear this Zika virus and how they deal with it. I got a firsthand look at how much work it takes for our local public health officials to protect our communities from mosquito-borne viruses. It is not just about Zika. It is also about the West Nile virus, which unfortunately has taken the lives of some Texans in the past, as well as other diseases such as dengue fever. The Presiding Officer knows all of them. Our folks at the local level do have their work cut out for them. They trap these mosquitoes every day to test them for the virus, and they spend a lot of time educating the public about how to better protect themselves. I walked around with them, and they pointed out places where water has been pooled in old tires or in swimming pools in the backyard or perhaps birdbaths or other places where mosquitoes, if they are given an opportunity, will simply breed. This is one way, by being better educated, that people can help protect themselves from these mosquito-borne viruses by eliminating the breeding ground for these mosquitoes. If you are a woman of childbearing age, being able to dress appropriately, spray yourself with mosquito repellant, and otherwise help yourself while we are waiting for the Federal Government to live up to its responsibility to provide the funds, which now we have finally done, would help. It became clear to me in our visits to Houston that our local officials need more help. More specifically, what they need is the research that will lead to a vaccine. We went through this experience in another context with the Ebola virus not that long ago. It is important that our scientists and researchers develop a vaccine to particularly protect women of childbearing age from the consequences of the Zika virus. We need a whole government response. We finally got one yesterday, one that deploys local, State, and Federal authorities. The funding bill we passed yesterday outlines a way forward for the Federal Government to do its part that will provide funding for communities in Texas and throughout the country. They are already working diligently to safeguard folks against the virus. As I mentioned, it will go a long way in helping local and State officials with prevention efforts and even working to create a vaccine. I am pleased we finally were able to get that done and overcome the impasse created by objections, obstructions, and filibusters of our friends across the aisle. Beyond getting this funding for the Zika research and prevention done, I wish to identify a few other things that we have been able to accomplish. As I came to the floor and said a couple of days ago, the senior Senator from Montana, who happens to head up the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, was caught basically telling the truth when he said that one of the things they are depending on is a narrative to help Democrats in the selection, this false narrative that under the Republican majority, under Republican leadership, we simply hadn't been getting many things done. We have been doing a lot to take care of the Nation's business during the events of the last 2 days, including the Water Resources Development Act that passed with 95 votes, which includes additional funding for Flint, MI, and their lead pipe water challenges. I mentioned the opioid crisis and heroin crisis. Recently, we passed a bill called the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act by more than 90 votes. As I mentioned, the junior Senators from Ohio and New Hampshire have provided such great leadership in that area. We also passed other reforms for chemical safety, the so-called TSCA bill, which provides companies with regulatory certainty so they can continue to create products Americans use every day. This bill proves we can responsibly protect the environment at the same time we are growing our economy. This legislation passed the Senate by a voice vote and received more than 400 votes in the House. We also passed legislation to impose stronger sanctions on North Korea in February. It sailed through this Chamber with one ``no'' vote. Of course, we also took care of intractable problems that we had trouble getting any traction on for a long time, major reform bills such as the Energy Policy Modernization Act to help bring our Nation's energy infrastructure up-to-date, as well as to expedite the permitting of liquefied natural gas exports, which the Presiding Officer has worked on a lot. I was just at Sabine Pass. Cheniere has a huge export facility for natural gas. Golden Pass and others are in the process of trying to get their permits, but they have been waiting a long time. This legislation will provide a shot clock, which will hopefully expedite that process. The energy we have been able to produce in this country is a great natural resource for the United States and a great economic engine. To make it available to our friends and allies around the world is very important. The Energy Policy Modernization Act as well as lifting the ban on crude oil, which we did last December, have been very important steps. I was discussing with the senior Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Alexander, chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, the important work we did reforming the bill known as No Child Left Behind with the Every Student Succeeds Act. This legislation was very important because many people had the impression that Washington had simply taken control of our K-12 education system. Under his skillful leadership, working with Senator Murray in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, they were able to write a piece of legislation that passed with overwhelming bipartisan margins that would devolve the control of K-12 education back to the States, local school districts, parents, and teachers. It literally removed the common core mandate that so many people had chafed under. We also finally have passed a Medicare payment reform system that had long plagued our medical community. I know many physicians in Texas told me they simply would not be able to take any more Medicare patients--which of course are our senior citizens--because the Federal Government kept cutting their payment rate and the uncertainty created by that. We finally fixed that on a bipartisan basis. Under the new majority in this Congress, we also saw President Obama sign other important laws, such as the Freedom of Information Improvement Act, a bill that will make our government more transparent and more accountable to the people we serve. By an overwhelming 99-to-1 vote, we passed the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, a bill that will help victims of human trafficking recover. We will support law enforcement in their fight against active shooters by passing and signing into law the POLICE Act, legislation that allows existing grant programs to be used for police training to deal with active shooter situations. I have traveled all around Texas with local police departments in both urban and rural areas, and they find this training very useful and timely. Unfortunately, it is necessary, in times such as these where we have had to learn from hard experience--if an active shooter is loose, they will continue to kill and people will continue to die unless the police can crash that site, stop the shooter, and then rescue, with emergency medical people, the people who are injured. By all accounts, I have to say the Senate, under Republican leadership, with cooperation from our Democratic [[Page S6254]] colleagues--because of course nothing happens around here unless it is bipartisan. That is the way this place is constructed. That is the way the Constitution is written. I am grateful that under the leadership and steady hand of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, we have gotten back to work and taken care of the country's business. Of course, we still have disagreements like we had over spending bills that led up to this continuing resolution, and in the lameduck it will leave us with having to deal with the long-term spending bills this December, but I simply want to make the point that leadership matters. Under the leadership of Senator McConnell, our committees are now actively producing legislation on a bipartisan basis that is then available to the majority leader to bring to the floor for us to debate, for Senators to offer suggestions for improvement by way of amendment and allow everybody to participate in that process to vote on the legislation and then bring it to the President's desk. I hope we can continue to put sound policy over the sort of partisan politics that left us in the uncomfortable and unenviable position we were in yesterday, trying to meet a deadline to keep the government up and running. With a little cooperation and a little elevation of responsibility to our constituents and the people we serve, rather than partisan politics, I think we can continue to do better.

Mr. President, yesterday we finally were able to move legislation forward that would keep the lights on here in Washington, at least until December, and provided very important relief that I want to emphasize. There is flood relief for States like Texas, but not just Texas-- Maryland, West Virginia, Louisiana, and Iowa, all of which will benefit from the flood relief that is provided for in this continuing resolution that was passed yesterday and was passed by the House as well. More importantly, perhaps, is the support for veterans programs and military construction. It is important that we pass legislation to meet our responsibilities to support our men and women in uniform wherever they may be serving, whether here at home or abroad. Thanks to the leadership of the Senator from Ohio and the Senator from New Hampshire, we passed legislation that will provide additional funds to deal with the opioid epidemic that is ravaging many parts of our country. As a medical doctor, the Presiding Officer knows that people unfortunately get hooked on opioid prescription drugs. Frequently, when that runs out, they often opt for cheaper, more plentiful heroin, which, when mixed with other ingredients such as fentanyl, makes it even more deadly and more likely that they will overdose with the use of this heroin laced with fentanyl. We have provided additional funds in this continuing resolution to deal with that. Finally, but very significantly, we also were able to break the impasse over funding for Zika. As we have come to learn, Zika is a mosquito-borne virus that has the potential of causing terrible birth defects in children. We have seen pictures of children with shrunken skulls from the microcephaly caused by this terrible mosquito-borne virus. We had been trying since last May to get that Zika funding done. For some reason, even though the amount of the funding, $1.1 billion, was agreed upon, our Democratic colleagues wouldn't take yes for an answer. Finally, yesterday, they decided to give up their filibuster and allow this legislation and this important funding to be done. My point is that we could have done this a long time ago. In fact, we wouldn't have had to pass the continuing resolution taking us over to December--just 10 weeks from now, when we will have to start all over again--if it weren't for the obstructionism and filibustering of our Democratic colleagues. Of course, the cause of this is a fight over Federal spending. We know there are caps on discretionary spending, and many of our Members, myself included, have become very concerned in this very dangerous world we live in that we have shortchanged our military and our national security support. So in order to get additional spending for our troops abroad and at home and to make sure that we are prepared for the next threat to our country, we increased spending for the Department of Defense, but the costs of doing that were increases in nondefense discretionary spending. Thus we get back into the same old fight, which unfortunately has left us $19 trillion in debt, where spending is simply out of control. That is the reason we ended up in this posture. It is highly regrettable. [[Page S6253]] Nobody would have chosen this--certainly I wouldn't have--as a first option. Now we are going to be confronted with the responsibility in December of passing appropriations bills that will take us through the next year, through the end of the fiscal year. So we have this resolution taken care of. It is behind us now, and that looms large ahead of us. I want to mention some of the good work being done in Texas by folks like the Harris County Mosquito & Vector Control unit. A few weeks ago, I had a chance to go on the rounds with them and set some of the traps for various mosquitoes. Actually, I got this idea from listening to Mike Rowe, who has this ``Dirty Jobs'' series, and I noticed one of them happened to be mosquito control. It occurred to me that maybe there was something for me to learn about how local leaders like those in Harris County identify these mosquitoes that bear this Zika virus and how they deal with it. I got a firsthand look at how much work it takes for our local public health officials to protect our communities from mosquito-borne viruses. It is not just about Zika.

[[page s6253]] nobody would have chosen this--certainly i wouldn't have--as a first option. now we are going to be confronted with the responsibility in december of passing appropriations bills that will take us through the next year, through the end of the fiscal year. so we have this resolution taken care of. it is behind us now, and that looms large ahead of us. i want to mention some of the good work being done in texas by folks like the harris county mosquito & vector control unit. a few weeks ago, i had a chance to go on the rounds with them and set some of the traps for various mosquitoes. actually, i got this idea from listening to mike rowe, who has this ``dirty jobs'' series, and i noticed one of them happened to be mosquito control. it occurred to me that maybe there was something for me to learn about how local leaders like those in harris county identify these mosquitoes that bear this zika virus and how they deal with it. i got a firsthand look at how much work it takes for our local public health officials to protect our communities from mosquito-borne viruses. it is not just about zika. it is also about the west nile virus, which unfortunately has taken the lives of some texans in the past, as well as other diseases such as dengue fever. the presiding officer knows all of them. our folks at the local level do have their work cut out for them. they trap these mosquitoes every day to test them for the virus, and they spend a lot of time educating the public about how to better protect themselves. i walked around with them, and they pointed out places where water has been pooled in old tires or in swimming pools in the backyard or perhaps birdbaths or other places where mosquitoes, if they are given an opportunity, will simply breed. this is one way, by being better educated, that people can help protect themselves from these mosquito-borne viruses by eliminating the breeding ground for these mosquitoes. if you are a woman of childbearing age, being able to dress appropriately, spray yourself with mosquito repellant, and otherwise help yourself while we are waiting for the federal government to live up to its responsibility to provide the funds, which now we have finally done, would help. it became clear to me in our visits to houston that our local officials need more help. more specifically, what they need is the research that will lead to a vaccine. we went through this experience in another context with the ebola virus not that long ago. it is important that our scientists and researchers develop a vaccine to particularly protect women of childbearing age from the consequences of the zika virus. we need a whole government response. we finally got one yesterday, one that deploys local, state, and federal authorities. the funding bill we passed yesterday outlines a way forward for the federal government to do its part that will provide funding for communities in texas and throughout the country. they are already working diligently to safeguard folks against the virus. as i mentioned, it will go a long way in helping local and state officials with prevention efforts and even working to create a vaccine. i am pleased we finally were able to get that done and overcome the impasse created by objections, obstructions, and filibusters of our friends across the aisle. beyond getting this funding for the zika research and prevention done, i wish to identify a few other things that we have been able to accomplish. as i came to the floor and said a couple of days ago, the senior senator from montana, who happens to head up the democratic senatorial campaign committee, was caught basically telling the truth when he said that one of the things they are depending on is a narrative to help democrats in the selection, this false narrative that under the republican majority, under republican leadership, we simply hadn't been getting many things done. we have been doing a lot to take care of the nation's business during the events of the last 2 days, including the water resources development act that passed with 95 votes, which includes additional funding for flint, mi, and their lead pipe water challenges. i mentioned the opioid crisis and heroin crisis. recently, we passed a bill called the comprehensive addiction and recovery act by more than 90 votes. as i mentioned, the junior senators from ohio and new hampshire have provided such great leadership in that area. we also passed other reforms for chemical safety, the so-called tsca bill, which provides companies with regulatory certainty so they can continue to create products americans use every day. this bill proves we can responsibly protect the environment at the same time we are growing our economy. this legislation passed the senate by a voice vote and received more than 400 votes in the house. we also passed legislation to impose stronger sanctions on north korea in february. it sailed through this chamber with one ``no'' vote. of course, we also took care of intractable problems that we had trouble getting any traction on for a long time, major reform bills such as the energy policy modernization act to help bring our nation's energy infrastructure up-to-date, as well as to expedite the permitting of liquefied natural gas exports, which the presiding officer has worked on a lot. i was just at sabine pass. cheniere has a huge export facility for natural gas. golden pass and others are in the process of trying to get their permits, but they have been waiting a long time. this legislation will provide a shot clock, which will hopefully expedite that process. the energy we have been able to produce in this country is a great natural resource for the united states and a great economic engine. to make it available to our friends and allies around the world is very important. the energy policy modernization act as well as lifting the ban on crude oil, which we did last december, have been very important steps. i was discussing with the senior senator from tennessee, mr. alexander, chairman of the health, education, labor, and pensions committee, the important work we did reforming the bill known as no child left behind with the every student succeeds act. this legislation was very important because many people had the impression that washington had simply taken control of our k-12 education system. under his skillful leadership, working with senator murray in the health, education, labor, and pensions committee, they were able to write a piece of legislation that passed with overwhelming bipartisan margins that would devolve the control of k-12 education back to the states, local school districts, parents, and teachers. it literally removed the common core mandate that so many people had chafed under. we also finally have passed a medicare payment reform system that had long plagued our medical community. i know many physicians in texas told me they simply would not be able to take any more medicare patients--which of course are our senior citizens--because the federal government kept cutting their payment rate and the uncertainty created by that. we finally fixed that on a bipartisan basis. under the new majority in this congress, we also saw president obama sign other important laws, such as the freedom of information improvement act, a bill that will make our government more transparent and more accountable to the people we serve. by an overwhelming 99-to-1 vote, we passed the justice for victims of trafficking act, a bill that will help victims of human trafficking recover. we will support law enforcement in their fight against active shooters by passing and signing into law the police act, legislation that allows existing grant programs to be used for police training to deal with active shooter situations. i have traveled all around texas with local police departments in both urban and rural areas, and they find this training very useful and timely. unfortunately, it is necessary, in times such as these where we have had to learn from hard experience--if an active shooter is loose, they will continue to kill and people will continue to die unless the police can crash that site, stop the shooter, and then rescue, with emergency medical people, the people who are injured. by all accounts, i have to say the senate, under republican leadership, with cooperation from our democratic [[page s6254]] colleagues--because of course nothing happens around here unless it is bipartisan. that is the way this place is constructed. that is the way the constitution is written. i am grateful that under the leadership and steady hand of majority leader mitch mcconnell of kentucky, we have gotten back to work and taken care of the country's business. of course, we still have disagreements like we had over spending bills that led up to this continuing resolution, and in the lameduck it will leave us with having to deal with the long-term spending bills this december, but i simply want to make the point that leadership matters. under the leadership of senator mcconnell, our committees are now actively producing legislation on a bipartisan basis that is then available to the majority leader to bring to the floor for us to debate, for senators to offer suggestions for improvement by way of amendment and allow everybody to participate in that process to vote on the legislation and then bring it to the president's desk. i hope we can continue to put sound policy over the sort of partisan politics that left us in the uncomfortable and unenviable position we were in yesterday, trying to meet a deadline to keep the government up and running. with a little cooperation and a little elevation of responsibility to our constituents and the people we serve, rather than partisan politics, i think we can continue to do better. mr. president, with that, i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. alexander. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for

I had the opportunity to meet Shimon Peres on numerous occasions. After each meeting, I walked away inspired and hopeful, having benefited immensely from his insight and perspective on a number of difficult global issues. Shimon Peres was not only one of the world's greatest statesmen but an ardent and committed advocate for peace. Given Shimon Peres's personal history and journey, it is truly remarkable that in his final years he refused to give in to cynicism and acrimony. As an immigrant to Israel, he was part of the grand project that cultivated a thriving country and society. As a warrior, he made sure that Israel was always ready and able to defend itself. As a politician, he contributed to the lively and robust democracy that the Israelis enjoy today, but he never shied away from reaching out across lines if he thought that was in Israel's interest. As a friend to the United States, his legacy is the unshakeable bond between our two countries, our governments, and our people. As a leader, he showed the world that extending a hand and daring to work for peace is worthy and just. He shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 1994 with Yasser Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin. The legacy of the Oslo Accords remains active today. We must continue to work toward a two-state solution, a Jewish and Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security. Shimon Peres's legacy is the patient, difficult, taxing, and necessary work of negotiations. It is only through direct negotiations and direct contact between the two sides, Israelis and Palestinians, that we can achieve this objective.

Mr. President, today I rise to speak about NASA and the human exploration program. NASA and our industry partners have made incredible progress in space exploration, and we are now closer to human missions into deep space than we have been since we last left the Moon nearly 45 years ago. We have set a lofty but achievable goal. We are going to Mars, and we are building the rockets and infrastructure to get us there. Achieving a complex, long-term goal can be challenging for a government, and this is especially true during an administration transition. But we can't let up on the development if we are going to put a human on Mars. That is why I, along with a number of my Commerce Committee colleagues, recently introduced the NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2016. This bipartisan bill will ensure that NASA maintains a continuity of purpose over the next year. The NASA Transition Authorization Act will give NASA the stability needed to keep NASA's important missions moving through 2017. It is not just important to the agency, it is something that is particularly important to the thousands of small- and medium-sized businesses across the country where dedicated men and women are working hard to move our space program forward. With this bill, we are sending a strong message to companies like Futuramic Tool & Engineering in Michigan. They are so proud to help build the rockets that will take us to Mars, and all of us in the Congress must stand solidly behind their efforts. A few weeks ago, I visited the Kennedy Space Center to witness the launch of the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft, a science mission that will take a sample from an asteroid and return that sample back to Earth. I saw the launch infrastructure taking shape for the massive SLS rocket and the assembly and testing of the Orion crew capsule that will launch in 2018 aboard SLS. I also saw amazing work by Boeing, SpaceX, and the United Launch Alliance on their rockets and spacecraft, which will start sending U.S. astronauts to the International Space Station in a couple of years. When you see the scale of these gigantic structures and the intricacy of the machinery, you really get a sense of how much power, energy, and precision it takes to conduct these very ambitious missions, and you see why we can't stop this momentum toward space. We are going boldly, and we are going to stay, and this legislation makes that point very clear. Importantly, this bill authorizes the entire agency, reaffirming that NASA is a multimission agency with important missions in space technology, aeronautics, exploration, and education. I am particularly pleased that the legislation underscores the importance of NASA's science programs. Investing in NASA's science mission leads to research and development of new technologies. These technologies increase the competitiveness of our space program and at the same time shed light on ways we can protect and improve our planet Earth. I cannot overstate the importance of this work to our Nation, our planet, and to humanity as a whole. I agree with many in the scientific community who believe we need to increase our investments in NASA science missions, aeronautics, and other areas of the agency, and I will work to improve these programs more comprehensively in future legislation. I am also pleased that parts of my bill reinforces NASA's ongoing efforts to educate the scientists and astronauts of the future. Earlier this year, Senator Gardner and I introduced legislation to promote American competitiveness through investments in research and STEM education. NASA's inspiring exploration and science missions make the agency uniquely positioned to engage students in STEM subjects. I witnessed this firsthand when former astronaut Charlie Precourt joined me in speaking to a group of Michigan students last year. I can assure you the students were much more excited to talk to a former astronaut than a U.S. Senator. It is also my hope that we can move forward and pass the space weather bill that Senator Gardner and I introduced earlier this year. This legislation assigns roles to the various Federal agencies involved with space weather and improves the research and observations needed to better predict space weather events. The space weather bill, together with the NASA bill, represents a strong and positive bipartisan consensus for our space program, including space science. Heliophysics, or the study of the Sun, is a critical component of NASA's science research mission and has major implications for life here on Earth. I was also pleased to see that NASA's new Associate Administer for Science, University of Michigan professor Dr. Thomas Zurbuchen, has a strong background in space weather. I wish him good luck in his new role. I wish to congratulate Senator Cruz, Chairman Thune, Ranking Member Nelson, Senator Wicker, Senator Rubio, Senator Udall, and Senator Cantwell for their hard work on the NASA transition act, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that NASA has a steady path forward to keep making groundbreaking discoveries and inspiring Americans for years to come. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I am particularly pleased that the legislation underscores the importance of NASA's science programs. Investing in NASA's science mission leads to research and development of new technologies. These technologies increase the competitiveness of our space program and at the same time shed light on ways we can protect and improve our planet Earth. I cannot overstate the importance of this work to our Nation, our planet, and to humanity as a whole. I agree with many in the scientific community who believe we need to increase our investments in NASA science missions, aeronautics, and other areas of the agency, and I will work to improve these programs more comprehensively in future legislation. I am also pleased that parts of my bill reinforces NASA's ongoing efforts to educate the scientists and astronauts of the future. Earlier this year, Senator Gardner and I introduced legislation to promote American competitiveness through investments in research and STEM education. NASA's inspiring exploration and science missions make the agency uniquely positioned to engage students in STEM subjects. I witnessed this firsthand when former astronaut Charlie Precourt joined me in speaking to a group of Michigan students last year. I can assure you the students were much more excited to talk to a former astronaut than a U.S. Senator. It is also my hope that we can move forward and pass the space weather bill that Senator Gardner and I introduced earlier this year. This legislation assigns roles to the various Federal agencies involved with space weather and improves the research and observations needed to better predict space weather events. The space weather bill, together with the NASA bill, represents a strong and positive bipartisan consensus for our space program, including space science. Heliophysics, or the study of the Sun, is a critical component of NASA's science research mission and has major implications for life here on Earth. I was also pleased to see that NASA's new Associate Administer for Science, University of Michigan professor Dr. Thomas Zurbuchen, has a strong background in space weather. I wish him good luck in his new role. I wish to congratulate Senator Cruz, Chairman Thune, Ranking Member Nelson, Senator Wicker, Senator Rubio, Senator Udall, and Senator Cantwell for their hard work on the NASA transition act, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that NASA has a steady path forward to keep making groundbreaking discoveries and inspiring Americans for years to come.

Mr. President, today I rise to speak about NASA and the human exploration program. NASA and our industry partners have made incredible progress in space exploration, and we are now closer to human missions into deep space than we have been since we last left the Moon nearly 45 years ago. We have set a lofty but achievable goal. We are going to Mars, and we are building the rockets and infrastructure to get us there. Achieving a complex, long-term goal can be challenging for a government, and this is especially true during an administration transition. But we can't let up on the development if we are going to put a human on Mars. That is why I, along with a number of my Commerce Committee colleagues, recently introduced the NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2016. This bipartisan bill will ensure that NASA maintains a continuity of purpose over the next year. The NASA Transition Authorization Act will give NASA the stability needed to keep NASA's important missions moving through 2017. It is not just important to the agency, it is something that is particularly important to the thousands of small- and medium-sized businesses across the country where dedicated men and women are working hard to move our space program forward. With this bill, we are sending a strong message to companies like Futuramic Tool & Engineering in Michigan. They are so proud to help build the rockets that will take us to Mars, and all of us in the Congress must stand solidly behind their efforts. A few weeks ago, I visited the Kennedy Space Center to witness the launch of the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft, a science mission that will take a sample from an asteroid and return that sample back to Earth. I saw the launch infrastructure taking shape for the massive SLS rocket and the assembly and testing of the Orion crew capsule that will launch in 2018 aboard SLS. I also saw amazing work by Boeing, SpaceX, and the United Launch Alliance on their rockets and spacecraft, which will start sending U.S. astronauts to the International Space Station in a couple of years. When you see the scale of these gigantic structures and the intricacy of the machinery, you really get a sense of how much power, energy, and precision it takes to conduct these very ambitious missions, and you see why we can't stop this momentum toward space. We are going boldly, and we are going to stay, and this legislation makes that point very clear.

CREC-2016-09-29-pt1-PgS6257,CREC-2016-09-29,114,JUSTICE AGAINST SPONSORS OF TERRORISM BILL,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S6257] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] JUSTICE AGAINST SPONSORS OF TERRORISM BILL Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak briefly about what occurred yesterday on the Senate floor when the Senate and the House of Representatives overrode a veto in order to ensure that the victims of 9/11 had an outlet, if you will, to try to seek justice and compensation. It was not as satisfactory as most in this body would hope. I am hopeful that over the course of time between now and the lameduck, or shortly thereafter, we will have a way to rectify some of the issues that concern us. I don't think many Members are aware of that fact that Senator Cardin and I attempted throughout the last weekend to set up a meeting with the White House to go over options that could, in fact, be more beneficial to our country and, at the same time, give some justice to the people of 9/11. I think many people here know that there were Saudi officials here seeking to come up with some option that might work better than the option that we all opted for, with none other available, yesterday. We were unable to get the President to convene a meeting that we had hoped would include the Secretary of State--we had a couple of conversations with Secretary Kerry and I also had conversations directly with the White House--and to set up a meeting between the President and Secretary Kerry, and, of course, Leader McConnell, Leader Reid, Senator Cardin, and myself, as well as the two major sponsors of the bill. The purpose was to see if the issues with the bill that we voted on yesterday could be resolved via a better route. Was there another option that we could consider, and could we develop a timeframe where that could be considered to take us to an improvement over where we were yesterday? For reasons that still are unknown to me, that was not achievable. There was no desire whatsoever to sit down and meet. I am unaware of any meetings that took place to try to resolve this issue. My friends on the other side of the aisle mentioned that they did have a letter read to them at lunch one day regarding the President's views. But now we have passed a bill. In fact, the victims of 9/11, whom many of us have met with, now have an outlet to try to seek justice. I think there was a desire--as was written yesterday in a letter, which many Senators here signed and many others have discussed--to amend what occurred yesterday to put us in a better place. So it is my hope, now that we have a piece of legislation that has become law, that maybe the executive branch--which, by the way, we tried to get to engage in this issue over this entire last year--will sit down with us and figure out an option that might work a little better than what passed yesterday on the floor. That hasn't occurred. There just has been no engagement. Even at the last minute, with the first veto override facing the administration, there was just an unwillingness to sit down and discuss routes that can take us to a better place. So I know there is a desire on the House side, I know there is a desire in this body, as was widely expressed yesterday, and I know there is a desire--no doubt--for the victims to be able to get answers to the questions they have had and to seek, in their minds, justice. There is a desire for that. But there is also a desire to do so in a manner that will not possibly undermine other equities that the U.S. Government and our people have. So I am hopeful that over the course of the next 6 weeks--last night I had a discussion with a Saudi official whom I know is desirous of sitting down and pursuing that, as they have been over the course of the last week--now that this has become law, the administration will be willing to do the same. My sense is that, with some of the comments that are going to be made publicly and some of the back-and-forth that will occur over the next 6 weeks, I am hopeful that the major sponsors of this bill, who are leaders in this body, will be willing to do that so that we will be able to create some alterations that, unfortunately, were not available to us yesterday to cause this piece of legislation to better serve U.S. national interests. With that, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to the en bloc consideration of the following Senate resolutions, which were submitted earlier today: S. Res. 591, S. Res. 592, S. Res. 593, and S. Res. 594. There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the resolutions en bloc. S. RES. 593 Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today as the chairman of the Senate Aging Committee to speak about the bipartisan resolution I have introduced with Senator McCaskill designating September 22, 2016--the first day of the fall season--as National Falls Prevention Awareness Day. The purpose of this designation is to better educate seniors, families, and caregivers--as well as government and civic organizations--about the practices, programs, and policies that can be taken to reduce the risk of falls. Falls are the leading cause of both fatal and nonfatal injuries among older adults. Older adults are the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population, and the number is projected to increase from 46.2 million in 2014 to 82.3 million in 2040. As more Americans age, falls will become even more numerous and costly than they are now. In 2014, approximately 2.8 million older Americans were treated in emergency rooms after falling, and more than 800,000 were subsequently hospitalized. Tragically, more than 27,000 of them died as a result of their injuries. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention puts these staggering statistics in a context that really brings the problem home: one out of every three seniors falls each year; every 13 seconds, a senior is treated in an emergency room for a fall; every 20 seconds, a senior dies from a fall. In addition to the human toll, these falls generate enormous economic costs. The annual total direct medical cost of fall-related injuries for older adults is approximately $34 billion. As more members of the baby boomer generation reach retirement age, these costs could nearly double within the next 5 years. Beyond the pain, suffering, and expense, falls can affect a senior's ability to live independently and can lead to a compromised quality of life, and thus to isolation and depression. Many people who fall, even if they are not injured, can develop a fear of falling. This may cause them to limit their activities, resulting in reduced mobility and physical activity. As a Senator representing the state with the oldest median age, I am especially concerned that Maine is eighth in the Nation in the percentage of seniors who suffer falls. Seniors in Maine who fall experience an average medical cost of approximately $16,000, according to the most recent statistics available. Fortunately, there are many organizations throughout Maine, including several Area Agencies on Aging, which provide important fall awareness programs, such as risk assessments, and exercise and balance programs. Our resolution urges relevant Federal, State, and local organizations to work to help educate seniors about ways they can reduce the risks that may result from a fall, including injury and even death. The resolution also recognizes that evidence-based programs reduce falls by utilizing cost-effective strategies, such as exercise programs, medication management, vision improvement, reduction of home hazards, and fall prevention education. [[Page S6257]] Family members and other caregivers can also help seniors evaluate their homes for fall-inducing hazards and modify their living space with adequate lighting and assistive devices, such as grab bars in the shower or tub, to help ensure a safe environment. There are more steps we can take. The costs of even minor modifications like grab bars and hand rails can add up quickly, while more expensive projects such as widening doorways or installing a ramp are financially unrealistic for far too many seniors. Several existing Federal programs can help seniors make these needed modifications to their homes, but few seniors are aware of them. To address this issue, I have joined Senators King and Ayotte in sponsoring S. 3230, the Senior Home Modification Assistance Initiative Act, which would improve awareness and better coordinate existing Federal programs. Falling is not an inevitable consequence of aging. Practical lifestyle adjustments, evidence-based prevention programs, community partnerships, and continued research are among the tools available to reduce falls. Fall-related injuries have a devastating impact on the lives of our seniors, their families, and their communities. Our goal is to unite professionals, older adults, caregivers, and family members so that they might all play a part in raising awareness and preventing falls. Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to the en bloc consideration of the following Senate resolutions, which were submitted earlier today: S. Res. 591, S. Res. 592, S. Res. 593, and S. Res. 594. There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the resolutions en bloc. S. RES. 593 Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today as the chairman of the Senate Aging Committee to speak about the bipartisan resolution I have introduced with Senator McCaskill designating September 22, 2016--the first day of the fall season--as National Falls Prevention Awareness Day. The purpose of this designation is to better educate seniors, families, and caregivers--as well as government and civic organizations--about the practices, programs, and policies that can be taken to reduce the risk of falls. Falls are the leading cause of both fatal and nonfatal injuries among older adults. Older adults are the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population, and the number is projected to increase from 46.2 million in 2014 to 82.3 million in 2040. As more Americans age, falls will become even more numerous and costly than they are now. In 2014, approximately 2.8 million older Americans were treated in emergency rooms after falling, and more than 800,000 were subsequently hospitalized. Tragically, more than 27,000 of them died as a result of their injuries. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention puts these staggering statistics in a context that really brings the problem home: one out of every three seniors falls each year; every 13 seconds, a senior is treated in an emergency room for a fall; every 20 seconds, a senior dies from a fall. In addition to the human toll, these falls generate enormous economic costs. The annual total direct medical cost of fall-related injuries for older adults is approximately $34 billion.

CREC-2016-09-29-pt1-PgS6257-2,CREC-2016-09-29,114,PRESCRIPTION DRUG AND HEROIN EPIDEMIC,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6257-S6260] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PRESCRIPTION DRUG AND HEROIN EPIDEMIC Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I am on the floor to talk about an epidemic that has gripped my State of Ohio and affected every single State in this body in every community we represent; that is, the issue of prescription drug, heroin, and now fentanyl and other synthetic heroin addiction. This epidemic is affecting our communities in fundamental ways. It is breaking families apart. It is causing crime. In fact, in my home State of Ohio, as I talk to law enforcement officials in every county, they tell me it is the top reason for crime and the growth of crime. It is affecting our first responders. When I go to a firehouse now and talk to firefighters about what they do with most of their time, they tell me they do a lot more heroin runs than fire runs, and thank God because they are out there saving lives every single day. They now carry Narcan with them, which is a form of naloxone, which is a miracle drug that reduces the dangers because it reverses the effects of an overdose. They have provided Narcan 19,000 times in the last year in Ohio. This is something that is out there in all of our communities. Sometimes there is a huge spike in these overdoses. Sadly, we had that this week in Columbus, OH, when in the space of 24 hours we had 27 overdoses. I have been working with the county coroner's office and with the health department in the city of Columbus to try to help them determine what the cause of this spike in overdoses was. It appears to be another case where there is a particularly dangerous batch of heroin, and it probably [[Page S6258]] has something to do with these synthetic heroins that are coming into the States and our country--fentanyl, carfentanil, or U-4. A few flakes of carfentanil ingested can kill you. This is very dangerous stuff. I wish I could say it is getting better, but I fear it is only getting worse. I have been on this floor talking about this issue every single week since February. During that time period, we passed, by a vote of 92 to 2, legislation to help address this issue. A vote of 92 to 2 is a rare vote in this place. Because Republicans and Democrats came together on this issue, we were able to pass something that will help. We spent 3\1/2\ years working on it--my colleague Senator Whitehouse and I and others were very involved--to help ensure that we can get better prevention and education efforts out there; do more in terms of treatment for people who are addicted and need to get help; provide longer term recovery, which we believe is essential to successful treatment because all the facts indicate that unless you have the longer term recovery, the relapse rate is very high. We also help our police officers, our firefighters, and other first responders by saying: Let's get them the Narcan they need and the training they need to be able to save those lives. Very specifically, it also helps our veterans and pregnant women who are addicted and these babies born with dependency. Some very specific programs are going to help to turn the tide. Overall, I would say the legislation is important because for the first time ever not only is Congress supporting recovery, as we talked about, but we are also finally addressing this issue as it needs to be addressed, as a public health issue, saying that this is not a question of someone making a bad moral choice as much as it is a disease. It needs to be treated like a disease. Until addiction is treated as a disease, I think it is going to be very difficult for us to turn this tide and begin to save these lives. In my home State, it has been the top cause of accidental death, surpassing car accidents, probably since 2007. Sadly, that is now the case in many States around the country. Nationally, we believe it is the No. 1 cause of accidental death. Think about that. It is a situation that affects every State and our entire country, so in the legislation that was passed yesterday, called the continuing resolution, which is basically just a bill to continue the funding of government through December--it is a short-term spending bill--we were able to include $37 million to help implement this legislation, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. I am very proud of that. I am very pleased that this Senate and the House were willing to go along with that. I know it is unusual because typically in a continuing resolution, you simply fund the previous year's funding and there are no new programs, no new starts. Frankly, the administration did not recommend a new start in this instance, although they did recommend an anomaly or an addition to the CR in 27 other areas. We had to rely on Members in the House and the Senate to do the right thing, to make an exception, and to include this funding. I thank my colleagues for doing that. I think it is critical that we begin to fully fund this Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act--otherwise known as CARA--and do it now and not wait until the regular appropriations process in December. That $37 million will help us stand up some programs. In particular, there are four I want to mention this morning. One is the community- based coalition prevention grants, the second is the grants for access to overdose treatment, the third is the recovery grants, and the fourth is the State incentive grants for a comprehensive response to this opioid issue. In other words, we are dealing with prevention, education, treatment, and recovery, helping the States be more engaged and involved in this issue so the Federal Government can be a better partner. On the prevention side, what it does is start to tell people what is going on. We are doing that here today on the floor but specifically to let people know what this connection is between prescription drugs, prescription drug overprescribing and abuse, and heroin and fentanyl. The reason I think this is very important is that probably four out of five heroin addicts in Ohio started with prescription drugs. Many people don't know that. When they are prescribed a prescription drug for pain relief, sometimes they don't realize the potential for addiction. To the young people who are listening today, you need to know this. You need to understand this. Everybody does. Again, if we are going to turn the tide, we have to change the way we deal with it to ensure that people are getting the education they need to avoid getting into the funnel of addiction in the first place. This program called CARA also increases the availability naloxone, or Narcan, which is very important. It has long-term recovery grants, including grants for recovery colleges, recovery universities. In other words, there are programs within colleges and universities to help on recovery because unfortunately we are finding that many of our students need these recovery programs as they are trying to work through their addiction. It also supports recovery high schools and increases eligibility for alternatives to incarceration--drug courts and veterans courts. So instead of putting people in jail for using these drugs, we say: Let's do a diversion. If you stay sober and clean, you will stay out of jail and we will get you into treatment. As I have seen around our State, these programs can help people get back on their feet. These are critical changes. The experts who helped us write this legislation over the last 3\1/2\ years, who came here to Washington, where we held four different conferences on this issue and brought in the best minds, the best practices, tell us they believe this legislation will make a difference in our communities day to day. Of course, it is up to the administration to actually implement this aggressively. Congress has done its work to pass these new programs, to pass this legislation. Now it shifts over to the executive branch to administer it. There is no excuse that the funding is not there because we were able to provide this funding. It is an exception to a normal CR, but we got the $37 million of funding in to begin to get these programs up and running so we can begin to turn the tide on this addiction epidemic. There are some aspects of the legislation that are already working that don't require a new program or setting up a new program. For instance, nurse practitioners and physician's assistants are now permitted to be involved in administering Suboxone at treatment clinics around the country. We should get that up and going now. That shouldn't require a lot of time, effort, and new programs. Earlier this week, I had the opportunity to visit a fire station in Norwood, OH. This is a community of about 19,000 people that has had 56 overdoses since June 1. That is one small town in Ohio with 56 overdoses just since this summer. I met with law enforcement, I met with firefighters, and I met with other first responders. I met with a treatment specialist they brought in to help and work with them. They are doing some very interesting intervention work with families. They showed me a video of a young man who was overdosing. They showed me a video of police officers and then firefighters administering Narcan-- not once, not twice, but three times. They showed how he was brought back to life. It was tough to watch, but firefighters and other first responders, police officers, see that every single day. Every 3 hours someone dies of an overdose in Ohio, but every 3 hours many more are saved by the administering of naloxone and Narcan to bring them back to life. As they are doing in Norwood, OH, the key is to intervene with that person, their family, and their friends and get that person into treatment so first responders are not administering Narcan again the next week or sometimes even the next day. Over the last 4 years, the number of heroin overdoses has tripled. Let me repeat that. Over the last 4 years, the number of heroin overdoses has tripled. Sadly, there is reason to believe this trend is continuing. Even though our first responders save the vast majority of those who overdose in Ohio, in Ohio we are losing more lives every day. We have already [[Page S6259]] had more drug overdoses and more drug overdose deaths this year, at the end of September, than we had all of last year. Of course, the numbers don't really tell the story. This story is about people. It is about dreams that have been shattered. It is about lives that have been cut short, often lives that are promising and young. It is about people like the 25-year-old student who was found dead of a heroin overdose in a bathroom stall at Columbus State University last week--25 years old, with his whole life ahead of him. It is about people like the Hess family of Crestline, OH. Their son Jason was a college student, a talented musician, a gifted athlete. One of his classmates got him to try heroin, to just try it. Almost immediately the drugs became everything in Jason's life. Jason's dad said: ``He liked his dealer more than he liked me.'' I have met with several hundred addicts or recovering addicts in Ohio over the last few years. Many of them tell me the same thing, which is that the drugs do become everything, so they become everything ahead of friends and family and work. Jason struggled with his addiction for 15 years. He was in and out of jail a lot and in and out of hospitals. In the past 2 months, his dad saved his life twice with naloxone because as family members they are now permitted to get Narcan over the counter. A few weeks ago, Jason died of an overdose. He was 35 years old. When his mother heard the death notice a few hours later--she was informed about it--she went to a cemetery with a bottle of Valium and committed suicide. It was her 60th birthday. In a note she left behind, she said: ``Thanks, heroin. Another victim.'' That was the note she left for all of us. With this crisis getting worse and taking such a toll in Ohio, we have to get this legislation implemented as soon as possible and we have to continue to fight, not just for more funding but for better ideas and ways to address this problem at every level and in a comprehensive way. We need support for safe disposal sites for prescription drugs. That is part of the legislation. When you are at the drugstore or at the pharmacy getting your medication, you will also have an opportunity right there to dispose of some of the medication you may not have used. I have been to these dropoff sites. I was at one recently at Walgreens in Toledo, where they are implementing a program to provide these sites and to provide safe disposal of these drugs so they don't get in the wrong hands. The experts tell us that in most families in America, there are drugs available that can be dangerous. Many times, they are painkiller prescription drugs that are very addictive. Recently in Marion, OH, an 18-month-old girl was able to get into her parents' Percocet, and she overdosed. We need these disposal sites to help protect kids like her. We need CARA's prevention efforts, such as its national awareness campaign that is making this link I talked about between prescription drugs and heroin. People need to understand this. Kelly Clixby of Marion, OH, needed that information. I met her earlier this year when I visited the Crawford-Marion Board of Alcohol, Drug Addiction, and Mental Health Services, where they are working hard every day to fight back against this epidemic. When I visited, the director, Jody Demo-Hodgins, told me that they are so overwhelmed with patients that ``most of the time, I feel like I'm drowning.'' They are overwhelmed, but they are doing a great job, and Kelly is an example. Kelly was prescribed painkillers. She became addicted to those painkillers, and, as is the case with many people, when those pills became too addictive and too expensive, when she couldn't afford them, she turned to heroin. Heroin is less expensive and more available, actually, in many cases. Within a year, she had lost her job, her house, her car, and custody of her five kids. Over the next decade, she and her husband Randy got a divorce. She was arrested four different times for shoplifting. She went to jail 19 times. She overdosed. Paramedics saved her life with naloxone, the Narcan we talked about. When Kelly was in the grip of this addiction, she didn't even want to get out of bed in the morning. She felt like she couldn't even get started on her day. She felt a constant sense of despair. Kelly's life turned around when her best friend Chrystina died of a heroin overdose. At that point, she realized she needed to get treatment. Nine months to the day after paramedics saved her life, Kelly got clean. With the help of medication--in her case, Vivitrol, which is medication that actually blocks the craving for the opioid, and it has worked very well in many cases in Ohio, including in our drug courts--with the help of Vivitrol and with the compassion of people at the Marion Area Counseling Center, Kerry has now been sober for a year and a half. She is back with her husband Randy. She is back with her kids and her family. She is now a grandmother. She is leading a 12-step program to help others. She is beating this because she got treatment. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act will help get more people into treatment so we can have more success stories like Kelly's. As I said, we need to raise awareness about how easy it is to become addicted to these opioids. I believe that will also help us to be able to push aside the stigma that is so often associated with addiction. That is one reason people don't come forward and get treatment. Kelly said the stigma of addiction kept her from getting help when she needed it. She said: You feel horrible for stealing because you need to get high. Then you get high and you feel horrible for getting high. And then you have to steal again. I feel guilty because I use, and I use because I feel guilty. And the stigma kept her from coming forward. Think about Tera Guest. Tera Guest is from Lorain, OH. She was a nurse's aide in a nursing home. She had been a good student and a talented artist. One day she was on her way to work and was hurrying down some stairs in her apartment building. She slipped, fell, and broke her ankle. When she went to her doctor, her doctor prescribed her Percocet and then OxyContin. She became addicted. When the prescriptions expired, like so many, she turned to heroin. Her mom Lori--who is a strong advocate on this issue and heads up the Lorain Community Task Force--found out about Tera's addiction when Tera was evicted from her apartment and started living out of her car. Lori felt what so many moms and dads have experienced in Ohio and across the country. She said that when her kids were young, ``We never discussed heroin. I never thought it would be part of our lives. You don't think that it's going to be your child; you don't think that it's going to be in your family. And when it is, the stigma makes you so ashamed'' and you don't want to talk about it. Her daughter Tera fought this addiction for 2 years. At just 24 years old, she died of an overdose of heroin laced with fentanyl. Fentanyl is this synthetic heroin that is creeping into our communities, this poison that is coming into our country from other countries, particularly China and India. It is coming here by the mail system. For Tera, it started with a broken ankle. It could happen to anybody. That is why we need this prevention effort--to warn people about the dangers and to help end the stigma to keep people from hiding it and to get them to come forward. For all these reasons--the prevention, the treatment, the recovery, and ending the stigma--the people we represent need this legislation to be enacted but also to be implemented as soon as possible. In order to help as many people as we can, we have to get the funding in the CR working and we have to continue to fight for funding. Madam President, we have talked about a lot of tough stories today. Unfortunately, the grip of this addiction is so great that there are a lot of heartbreaking stories, and it is getting worse, not better. But there is also hope. There is hope I see every week when I am back home in Ohio. I recently met Sheila Humphrey, whose child succumbed to a heroin addiction and an overdose and death. She started her own organization with other moms and family members, and they are having great success in intervening with these families and explaining the reason to get treatment and get [[Page S6260]] into recovery. She gave me this bracelet. It talks about the Rally for Recovery in 2016. We had one in Ohio last weekend that I was able to attend. At that rally, with the Ohio Citizen Advocates for Addiction Recovery, I got to meet so many people who are in recovery. They came forward to talk to me about their stories and to talk about what they are doing to help others. They talked to me about the need for us to have more treatments and recovery programs. I met someone who has not only beaten the addiction but is a counselor in Dayton, OH, named Gary. Gary Gonnella is helping others to get their lives back on track. He is incredibly persuasive because he has a story to tell. Gary told me: Senator, there is hope. Don't give up. He is telling me don't give up. I am telling my colleagues: People expect us not to give up. They are not giving up. This guy, Gary, is a recovering addict. He is not giving up, and he is asking us to ensure we do everything we can to help--to be a better partner with State and local governments and with the nonprofits out there in the trenches every day that are doing this work with folks like Gary who are looking for our help. CARA will give more people more hope. So on behalf of all of those whom I talked about today, those whose lives were cut short, and their family members, and on behalf of our communities, let's continue this fight. Let's ensure we do, in fact, get CARA implemented quickly. Let's ensure we do continue to push not just to provide funding but new ideas and better ideas. There is new legislation we just introduced in the last couple of weeks called the STOP Act that stops the synthetic heroin, the fentanyl, the carfentanil, and U-4 from coming into our country from other countries by requiring packages include information about where the package is from, what is in it, and where it is going. That is not required now by the post office, but it is required by private carriers. So these traffickers are using the postal system, including the U.S. postal system, to move these deadly chemicals into our communities. We need to stop that. So there is more we can and should do. It is our responsibility to do that. As we break for these elections and as the lameduck period in December comes upon us after that, let's continue to work to ensure we are able to turn this tide and bring back more hope. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6257-S6260] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PRESCRIPTION DRUG AND HEROIN EPIDEMIC Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I am on the floor to talk about an epidemic that has gripped my State of Ohio and affected every single State in this body in every community we represent; that is, the issue of prescription drug, heroin, and now fentanyl and other synthetic heroin addiction. This epidemic is affecting our communities in fundamental ways. It is breaking families apart. It is causing crime. In fact, in my home State of Ohio, as I talk to law enforcement officials in every county, they tell me it is the top reason for crime and the growth of crime. It is affecting our first responders. When I go to a firehouse now and talk to firefighters about what they do with most of their time, they tell me they do a lot more heroin runs than fire runs, and thank God because they are out there saving lives every single day. They now carry Narcan with them, which is a form of naloxone, which is a miracle drug that reduces the dangers because it reverses the effects of an overdose. They have provided Narcan 19,000 times in the last year in Ohio. This is something that is out there in all of our communities. Sometimes there is a huge spike in these overdoses. Sadly, we had that this week in Columbus, OH, when in the space of 24 hours we had 27 overdoses. I have been working with the county coroner's office and with the health department in the city of Columbus to try to help them determine what the cause of this spike in overdoses was. It appears to be another case where there is a particularly dangerous batch of heroin, and it probably [[Page S6258]] has something to do with these synthetic heroins that are coming into the States and our country--fentanyl, carfentanil, or U-4. A few flakes of carfentanil ingested can kill you. This is very dangerous stuff. I wish I could say it is getting better, but I fear it is only getting worse. I have been on this floor talking about this issue every single week since February. During that time period, we passed, by a vote of 92 to 2, legislation to help address this issue. A vote of 92 to 2 is a rare vote in this place. Because Republicans and Democrats came together on this issue, we were able to pass something that will help. We spent 3\1/2\ years working on it--my colleague Senator Whitehouse and I and others were very involved--to help ensure that we can get better prevention and education efforts out there; do more in terms of treatment for people who are addicted and need to get help; provide longer term recovery, which we believe is essential to successful treatment because all the facts indicate that unless you have the longer term recovery, the relapse rate is very high. We also help our police officers, our firefighters, and other first responders by saying: Let's get them the Narcan they need and the training they need to be able to save those lives. Very specifically, it also helps our veterans and pregnant women who are addicted and these babies born with dependency. Some very specific programs are going to help to turn the tide. Overall, I would say the legislation is important because for the first time ever not only is Congress supporting recovery, as we talked about, but we are also finally addressing this issue as it needs to be addressed, as a public health issue, saying that this is not a question of someone making a bad moral choice as much as it is a disease. It needs to be treated like a disease. Until addiction is treated as a disease, I think it is going to be very difficult for us to turn this tide and begin to save these lives. In my home State, it has been the top cause of accidental death, surpassing car accidents, probably since 2007. Sadly, that is now the case in many States around the country. Nationally, we believe it is the No. 1 cause of accidental death. Think about that. It is a situation that affects every State and our entire country, so in the legislation that was passed yesterday, called the continuing resolution, which is basically just a bill to continue the funding of government through December--it is a short-term spending bill--we were able to include $37 million to help implement this legislation, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. I am very proud of that. I am very pleased that this Senate and the House were willing to go along with that. I know it is unusual because typically in a continuing resolution, you simply fund the previous year's funding and there are no new programs, no new starts. Frankly, the administration did not recommend a new start in this instance, although they did recommend an anomaly or an addition to the CR in 27 other areas. We had to rely on Members in the House and the Senate to do the right thing, to make an exception, and to include this funding. I thank my colleagues for doing that. I think it is critical that we begin to fully fund this Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act--otherwise known as CARA--and do it now and not wait until the regular appropriations process in December. That $37 million will help us stand up some programs. In particular, there are four I want to mention this morning. One is the community- based coalition prevention grants, the second is the grants for access to overdose treatment, the third is the recovery grants, and the fourth is the State incentive grants for a comprehensive response to this opioid issue. In other words, we are dealing with prevention, education, treatment, and recovery, helping the States be more engaged and involved in this issue so the Federal Government can be a better partner. On the prevention side, what it does is start to tell people what is going on. We are doing that here today on the floor but specifically to let people know what this connection is between prescription drugs, prescription drug overprescribing and abuse, and heroin and fentanyl. The reason I think this is very important is that probably four out of five heroin addicts in Ohio started with prescription drugs. Many people don't know that. When they are prescribed a prescription drug for pain relief, sometimes they don't realize the potential for addiction. To the young people who are listening today, you need to know this. You need to understand this. Everybody does. Again, if we are going to turn the tide, we have to change the way we deal with it to ensure that people are getting the education they need to avoid getting into the funnel of addiction in the first place. This program called CARA also increases the availability naloxone, or Narcan, which is very important. It has long-term recovery grants, including grants for recovery colleges, recovery universities. In other words, there are programs within colleges and universities to help on recovery because unfortunately we are finding that many of our students need these recovery programs as they are trying to work through their addiction. It also supports recovery high schools and increases eligibility for alternatives to incarceration--drug courts and veterans courts. So instead of putting people in jail for using these drugs, we say: Let's do a diversion. If you stay sober and clean, you will stay out of jail and we will get you into treatment. As I have seen around our State, these programs can help people get back on their feet. These are critical changes. The experts who helped us write this legislation over the last 3\1/2\ years, who came here to Washington, where we held four different conferences on this issue and brought in the best minds, the best practices, tell us they believe this legislation will make a difference in our communities day to day. Of course, it is up to the administration to actually implement this aggressively. Congress has done its work to pass these new programs, to pass this legislation. Now it shifts over to the executive branch to administer it. There is no excuse that the funding is not there because we were able to provide this funding. It is an exception to a normal CR, but we got the $37 million of funding in to begin to get these programs up and running so we can begin to turn the tide on this addiction epidemic. There are some aspects of the legislation that are already working that don't require a new program or setting up a new program. For instance, nurse practitioners and physician's assistants are now permitted to be involved in administering Suboxone at treatment clinics around the country. We should get that up and going now. That shouldn't require a lot of time, effort, and new programs. Earlier this week, I had the opportunity to visit a fire station in Norwood, OH. This is a community of about 19,000 people that has had 56 overdoses since June 1. That is one small town in Ohio with 56 overdoses just since this summer. I met with law enforcement, I met with firefighters, and I met with other first responders. I met with a treatment specialist they brought in to help and work with them. They are doing some very interesting intervention work with families. They showed me a video of a young man who was overdosing. They showed me a video of police officers and then firefighters administering Narcan-- not once, not twice, but three times. They showed how he was brought back to life. It was tough to watch, but firefighters and other first responders, police officers, see that every single day. Every 3 hours someone dies of an overdose in Ohio, but every 3 hours many more are saved by the administering of naloxone and Narcan to bring them back to life. As they are doing in Norwood, OH, the key is to intervene with that person, their family, and their friends and get that person into treatment so first responders are not administering Narcan again the next week or sometimes even the next day. Over the last 4 years, the number of heroin overdoses has tripled. Let me repeat that. Over the last 4 years, the number of heroin overdoses has tripled. Sadly, there is reason to believe this trend is continuing. Even though our first responders save the vast majority of those who overdose in Ohio, in Ohio we are losing more lives every day. We have already [[Page S6259]] had more drug overdoses and more drug overdose deaths this year, at the end of September, than we had all of last year. Of course, the numbers don't really tell the story. This story is about people. It is about dreams that have been shattered. It is about lives that have been cut short, often lives that are promising and young. It is about people like the 25-year-old student who was found dead of a heroin overdose in a bathroom stall at Columbus State University last week--25 years old, with his whole life ahead of him. It is about people like the Hess family of Crestline, OH. Their son Jason was a college student, a talented musician, a gifted athlete. One of his classmates got him to try heroin, to just try it. Almost immediately the drugs became everything in Jason's life. Jason's dad said: ``He liked his dealer more than he liked me.'' I have met with several hundred addicts or recovering addicts in Ohio over the last few years. Many of them tell me the same thing, which is that the drugs do become everything, so they become everything ahead of friends and family and work. Jason struggled with his addiction for 15 years. He was in and out of jail a lot and in and out of hospitals. In the past 2 months, his dad saved his life twice with naloxone because as family members they are now permitted to get Narcan over the counter. A few weeks ago, Jason died of an overdose. He was 35 years old. When his mother heard the death notice a few hours later--she was informed about it--she went to a cemetery with a bottle of Valium and committed suicide. It was her 60th birthday. In a note she left behind, she said: ``Thanks, heroin. Another victim.'' That was the note she left for all of us. With this crisis getting worse and taking such a toll in Ohio, we have to get this legislation implemented as soon as possible and we have to continue to fight, not just for more funding but for better ideas and ways to address this problem at every level and in a comprehensive way. We need support for safe disposal sites for prescription drugs. That is part of the legislation. When you are at the drugstore or at the pharmacy getting your medication, you will also have an opportunity right there to dispose of some of the medication you may not have used. I have been to these dropoff sites. I was at one recently at Walgreens in Toledo, where they are implementing a program to provide these sites and to provide safe disposal of these drugs so they don't get in the wrong hands. The experts tell us that in most families in America, there are drugs available that can be dangerous. Many times, they are painkiller prescription drugs that are very addictive. Recently in Marion, OH, an 18-month-old girl was able to get into her parents' Percocet, and she overdosed. We need these disposal sites to help protect kids like her. We need CARA's prevention efforts, such as its national awareness campaign that is making this link I talked about between prescription drugs and heroin. People need to understand this. Kelly Clixby of Marion, OH, needed that information. I met her earlier this year when I visited the Crawford-Marion Board of Alcohol, Drug Addiction, and Mental Health Services, where they are working hard every day to fight back against this epidemic. When I visited, the director, Jody Demo-Hodgins, told me that they are so overwhelmed with patients that ``most of the time, I feel like I'm drowning.'' They are overwhelmed, but they are doing a great job, and Kelly is an example. Kelly was prescribed painkillers. She became addicted to those painkillers, and, as is the case with many people, when those pills became too addictive and too expensive, when she couldn't afford them, she turned to heroin. Heroin is less expensive and more available, actually, in many cases. Within a year, she had lost her job, her house, her car, and custody of her five kids. Over the next decade, she and her husband Randy got a divorce. She was arrested four different times for shoplifting. She went to jail 19 times. She overdosed. Paramedics saved her life with naloxone, the Narcan we talked about. When Kelly was in the grip of this addiction, she didn't even want to get out of bed in the morning. She felt like she couldn't even get started on her day. She felt a constant sense of despair. Kelly's life turned around when her best friend Chrystina died of a heroin overdose. At that point, she realized she needed to get treatment. Nine months to the day after paramedics saved her life, Kelly got clean. With the help of medication--in her case, Vivitrol, which is medication that actually blocks the craving for the opioid, and it has worked very well in many cases in Ohio, including in our drug courts--with the help of Vivitrol and with the compassion of people at the Marion Area Counseling Center, Kerry has now been sober for a year and a half. She is back with her husband Randy. She is back with her kids and her family. She is now a grandmother. She is leading a 12-step program to help others. She is beating this because she got treatment. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act will help get more people into treatment so we can have more success stories like Kelly's. As I said, we need to raise awareness about how easy it is to become addicted to these opioids. I believe that will also help us to be able to push aside the stigma that is so often associated with addiction. That is one reason people don't come forward and get treatment. Kelly said the stigma of addiction kept her from getting help when she needed it. She said: You feel horrible for stealing because you need to get high. Then you get high and you feel horrible for getting high. And then you have to steal again. I feel guilty because I use, and I use because I feel guilty. And the stigma kept her from coming forward. Think about Tera Guest. Tera Guest is from Lorain, OH. She was a nurse's aide in a nursing home. She had been a good student and a talented artist. One day she was on her way to work and was hurrying down some stairs in her apartment building. She slipped, fell, and broke her ankle. When she went to her doctor, her doctor prescribed her Percocet and then OxyContin. She became addicted. When the prescriptions expired, like so many, she turned to heroin. Her mom Lori--who is a strong advocate on this issue and heads up the Lorain Community Task Force--found out about Tera's addiction when Tera was evicted from her apartment and started living out of her car. Lori felt what so many moms and dads have experienced in Ohio and across the country. She said that when her kids were young, ``We never discussed heroin. I never thought it would be part of our lives. You don't think that it's going to be your child; you don't think that it's going to be in your family. And when it is, the stigma makes you so ashamed'' and you don't want to talk about it. Her daughter Tera fought this addiction for 2 years. At just 24 years old, she died of an overdose of heroin laced with fentanyl. Fentanyl is this synthetic heroin that is creeping into our communities, this poison that is coming into our country from other countries, particularly China and India. It is coming here by the mail system. For Tera, it started with a broken ankle. It could happen to anybody. That is why we need this prevention effort--to warn people about the dangers and to help end the stigma to keep people from hiding it and to get them to come forward.

This is a community of about 19,000 people that has had 56 overdoses since June 1. That is one small town in Ohio with 56 overdoses just since this summer. I met with law enforcement, I met with firefighters, and I met with other first responders. I met with a treatment specialist they brought in to help and work with them. They are doing some very interesting intervention work with families. They showed me a video of a young man who was overdosing. They showed me a video of police officers and then firefighters administering Narcan-- not once, not twice, but three times. They showed how he was brought back to life. It was tough to watch, but firefighters and other first responders, police officers, see that every single day. Every 3 hours someone dies of an overdose in Ohio, but every 3 hours many more are saved by the administering of naloxone and Narcan to bring them back to life. As they are doing in Norwood, OH, the key is to intervene with that person, their family, and their friends and get that person into treatment so first responders are not administering Narcan again the next week or sometimes even the next day. Over the last 4 years, the number of heroin overdoses has tripled. Let me repeat that. Over the last 4 years, the number of heroin overdoses has tripled. Sadly, there is reason to believe this trend is continuing. Even though our first responders save the vast majority of those who overdose in Ohio, in Ohio we are losing more lives every day. We have already [[Page S6259]] had more drug overdoses and more drug overdose deaths this year, at the end of September, than we had all of last year. Of course, the numbers don't really tell the story. This story is about people. It is about dreams that have been shattered. It is about lives that have been cut short, often lives that are promising and young. It is about people like the 25-year-old student who was found dead of a heroin overdose in a bathroom stall at Columbus State University last week--25 years old, with his whole life ahead of him. It is about people like the Hess family of Crestline, OH. Their son Jason was a college student, a talented musician, a gifted athlete. One of his classmates got him to try heroin, to just try it. Almost immediately the drugs became everything in Jason's life. Jason's dad said: ``He liked his dealer more than he liked me.'' I have met with several hundred addicts or recovering addicts in Ohio over the last few years. Many of them tell me the same thing, which is that the drugs do become everything, so they become everything ahead of friends and family and work. Jason struggled with his addiction for 15 years. He was in and out of jail a lot and in and out of hospitals. In the past 2 months, his dad saved his life twice with naloxone because as family members they are now permitted to get Narcan over the counter. A few weeks ago, Jason died of an overdose. He was 35 years old. When his mother heard the death notice a few hours later--she was informed about it--she went to a cemetery with a bottle of Valium and committed suicide. It was her 60th birthday. In a note she left behind, she said: ``Thanks, heroin. Another victim.'' That was the note she left for all of us. With this crisis getting worse and taking such a toll in Ohio, we have to get this legislation implemented as soon as possible and we have to continue to fight, not just for more funding but for better ideas and ways to address this problem at every level and in a comprehensive way. We need support for safe disposal sites for prescription drugs. That is part of the legislation. When you are at the drugstore or at the pharmacy getting your medication, you will also have an opportunity right there to dispose of some of the medication you may not have used. I have been to these dropoff sites. I was at one recently at Walgreens in Toledo, where they are implementing a program to provide these sites and to provide safe disposal of these drugs so they don't get in the wrong hands. The experts tell us that in most families in America, there are drugs available that can be dangerous. Many times, they are painkiller prescription drugs that are very addictive. Recently in Marion, OH, an 18-month-old girl was able to get into her parents' Percocet, and she overdosed. We need these disposal sites to help protect kids like her. We need CARA's prevention efforts, such as its national awareness campaign that is making this link I talked about between prescription drugs and heroin. People need to understand this. Kelly Clixby of Marion, OH, needed that information. I met her earlier this year when I visited the Crawford-Marion Board of Alcohol, Drug Addiction, and Mental Health Services, where they are working hard every day to fight back against this epidemic. When I visited, the director, Jody Demo-Hodgins, told me that they are so overwhelmed with patients that ``most of the time, I feel like I'm drowning.'' They are overwhelmed, but they are doing a great job, and Kelly is an example. Kelly was prescribed painkillers. She became addicted to those painkillers, and, as is the case with many people, when those pills became too addictive and too expensive, when she couldn't afford them, she turned to heroin. Heroin is less expensive and more available, actually, in many cases. Within a year, she had lost her job, her house, her car, and custody of her five kids. Over the next decade, she and her husband Randy got a divorce. She was arrested four different times for shoplifting. She went to jail 19 times. She overdosed. Paramedics saved her life with naloxone, the Narcan we talked about. When Kelly was in the grip of this addiction, she didn't even want to get out of bed in the morning. She felt like she couldn't even get started on her day. She felt a constant sense of despair. Kelly's life turned around when her best friend Chrystina died of a heroin overdose. At that point, she realized she needed to get treatment. Nine months to the day after paramedics saved her life, Kelly got clean. With the help of medication--in her case, Vivitrol, which is medication that actually blocks the craving for the opioid, and it has worked very well in many cases in Ohio, including in our drug courts--with the help of Vivitrol and with the compassion of people at the Marion Area Counseling Center, Kerry has now been sober for a year and a half. She is back with her husband Randy. She is back with her kids and her family. She is now a grandmother. She is leading a 12-step program to help others. She is beating this because she got treatment. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act will help get more people into treatment so we can have more success stories like Kelly's. As I said, we need to raise awareness about how easy it is to become addicted to these opioids. I believe that will also help us to be able to push aside the stigma that is so often associated with addiction. That is one reason people don't come forward and get treatment. Kelly said the stigma of addiction kept her from getting help when she needed it. She said: You feel horrible for stealing because you need to get high. Then you get high and you feel horrible for getting high. And then you have to steal again. I feel guilty because I use, and I use because I feel guilty. And the stigma kept her from coming forward. Think about Tera Guest. Tera Guest is from Lorain, OH. She was a nurse's aide in a nursing home. She had been a good student and a talented artist. One day she was on her way to work and was hurrying down some stairs in her apartment building. She slipped, fell, and broke her ankle. When she went to her doctor, her doctor prescribed her Percocet and then OxyContin. She became addicted. When the prescriptions expired, like so many, she turned to heroin. Her mom Lori--who is a strong advocate on this issue and heads up the Lorain Community Task Force--found out about Tera's addiction when Tera was evicted from her apartment and started living out of her car. Lori felt what so many moms and dads have experienced in Ohio and across the country. She said that when her kids were young, ``We never discussed heroin. I never thought it would be part of our lives. You don't think that it's going to be your child; you don't think that it's going to be in your family. And when it is, the stigma makes you so ashamed'' and you don't want to talk about it. Her daughter Tera fought this addiction for 2 years. At just 24 years old, she died of an overdose of heroin laced with fentanyl. Fentanyl is this synthetic heroin that is creeping into our communities, this poison that is coming into our country from other countries, particularly China and India. It is coming here by the mail system. For Tera, it started with a broken ankle. It could happen to anybody. That is why we need this prevention effort--to warn people about the dangers and to help end the stigma to keep people from hiding it and to get them to come forward. For all these reasons--the prevention, the treatment, the recovery, and ending the stigma--the people we represent need this legislation to be enacted but also to be implemented as soon as possible. In order to help as many people as we can, we have to get the funding in the CR working and we have to continue to fight for funding. Madam President, we have talked about a lot of tough stories today. Unfortunately, the grip of this addiction is so great that there are a lot of heartbreaking stories, and it is getting worse, not better. But there is also hope. There is hope I see every week when I am back home in Ohio. I recently met Sheila Humphrey, whose child succumbed to a heroin addiction and an overdose and death. She started her own organization with other moms and family members, and they are having great success in intervening with these families and explaining the reason to get treatment and get [[Page S6260]] into recovery. She gave me this bracelet. It talks about the Rally for Recovery in 2016. We had one in Ohio last weekend that I was able to attend. At that rally, with the Ohio Citizen Advocates for Addiction Recovery, I got to meet so many people who are in recovery. They came forward to talk to me about their stories and to talk about what they are doing to help others. They talked to me about the need for us to have more treatments and recovery programs. I met someone who has not only beaten the addiction but is a counselor in Dayton, OH, named Gary. Gary Gonnella is helping others to get their lives back on track. He is incredibly persuasive because he has a story to tell. Gary told me: Senator, there is hope. Don't give up. He is telling me don't give up. I am telling my colleagues: People expect us not to give up. They are not giving up. This guy, Gary, is a recovering addict. He is not giving up, and he is asking us to ensure we do everything we can to help--to be a better partner with State and local governments and with the nonprofits out there in the trenches every day that are doing this work with folks like Gary who are looking for our help. CARA will give more people more hope. So on behalf of all of those whom I talked about today, those whose lives were cut short, and their family members, and on behalf of our communities, let's continue this fight. Let's ensure we do, in fact, get CARA implemented quickly. Let's ensure we do continue to push not just to provide funding but new ideas and better ideas. There is new legislation we just introduced in the last couple of weeks called the STOP Act that stops the synthetic heroin, the fentanyl, the carfentanil, and U-4 from coming into our country from other countries by requiring packages include information about where the package is from, what is in it, and where it is going. That is not required now by the post office, but it is required by private carriers. So these traffickers are using the postal system, including the U.S. postal system, to move these deadly chemicals into our communities. We need to stop that. So there is more we can and should do. It is our responsibility to do that. As we break for these elections and as the lameduck period in December comes upon us after that, let's continue to work to ensure we are able to turn this tide and bring back more hope. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania. ____________________",package_114_206.csv,21209,21209,21283,"[congressional record volume 162, number 148 (thursday, september 29, 2016)] [senate] [pages s6257-s6260] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] prescription drug and heroin epidemic mr. portman. madam president, i am on the floor to talk about an epidemic that has gripped my state of ohio and affected every single state in this body in every community we represent; that is, the issue of prescription drug, heroin, and now fentanyl and other synthetic heroin addiction. this epidemic is affecting our communities in fundamental ways. it is breaking families apart. it is causing crime. in fact, in my home state of ohio, as i talk to law enforcement officials in every county, they tell me it is the top reason for crime and the growth of crime. it is affecting our first responders. when i go to a firehouse now and talk to firefighters about what they do with most of their time, they tell me they do a lot more heroin runs than fire runs, and thank god because they are out there saving lives every single day. they now carry narcan with them, which is a form of naloxone, which is a miracle drug that reduces the dangers because it reverses the effects of an overdose. they have provided narcan 19,000 times in the last year in ohio. this is something that is out there in all of our communities. sometimes there is a huge spike in these overdoses. sadly, we had that this week in columbus, oh, when in the space of 24 hours we had 27 overdoses. i have been working with the county coroner's office and with the health department in the city of columbus to try to help them determine what the cause of this spike in overdoses was. it appears to be another case where there is a particularly dangerous batch of heroin, and it probably [[page s6258]] has something to do with these synthetic heroins that are coming into the states and our country--fentanyl, carfentanil, or u-4. a few flakes of carfentanil ingested can kill you. this is very dangerous stuff. i wish i could say it is getting better, but i fear it is only getting worse. i have been on this floor talking about this issue every single week since february. during that time period, we passed, by a vote of 92 to 2, legislation to help address this issue. a vote of 92 to 2 is a rare vote in this place. because republicans and democrats came together on this issue, we were able to pass something that will help. we spent 3\1/2\ years working on it--my colleague senator whitehouse and i and others were very involved--to help ensure that we can get better prevention and education efforts out there; do more in terms of treatment for people who are addicted and need to get help; provide longer term recovery, which we believe is essential to successful treatment because all the facts indicate that unless you have the longer term recovery, the relapse rate is very high. we also help our police officers, our firefighters, and other first responders by saying: let's get them the narcan they need and the training they need to be able to save those lives. very specifically, it also helps our veterans and pregnant women who are addicted and these babies born with dependency. some very specific programs are going to help to turn the tide. overall, i would say the legislation is important because for the first time ever not only is congress supporting recovery, as we talked about, but we are also finally addressing this issue as it needs to be addressed, as a public health issue, saying that this is not a question of someone making a bad moral choice as much as it is a disease. it needs to be treated like a disease. until addiction is treated as a disease, i think it is going to be very difficult for us to turn this tide and begin to save these lives. in my home state, it has been the top cause of accidental death, surpassing car accidents, probably since 2007. sadly, that is now the case in many states around the country. nationally, we believe it is the no. 1 cause of accidental death. think about that. it is a situation that affects every state and our entire country, so in the legislation that was passed yesterday, called the continuing resolution, which is basically just a bill to continue the funding of government through december--it is a short-term spending bill--we were able to include $37 million to help implement this legislation, the comprehensive addiction and recovery act. i am very proud of that. i am very pleased that this senate and the house were willing to go along with that. i know it is unusual because typically in a continuing resolution, you simply fund the previous year's funding and there are no new programs, no new starts. frankly, the administration did not recommend a new start in this instance, although they did recommend an anomaly or an addition to the cr in 27 other areas. we had to rely on members in the house and the senate to do the right thing, to make an exception, and to include this funding. i thank my colleagues for doing that. i think it is critical that we begin to fully fund this comprehensive addiction and recovery act--otherwise known as cara--and do it now and not wait until the regular appropriations process in december. that $37 million will help us stand up some programs. in particular, there are four i want to mention this morning. one is the community- based coalition prevention grants, the second is the grants for access to overdose treatment, the third is the recovery grants, and the fourth is the state incentive grants for a comprehensive response to this opioid issue. in other words, we are dealing with prevention, education, treatment, and recovery, helping the states be more engaged and involved in this issue so the federal government can be a better partner. on the prevention side, what it does is start to tell people what is going on. we are doing that here today on the floor but specifically to let people know what this connection is between prescription drugs, prescription drug overprescribing and abuse, and heroin and fentanyl. the reason i think this is very important is that probably four out of five heroin addicts in ohio started with prescription drugs. many people don't know that. when they are prescribed a prescription drug for pain relief, sometimes they don't realize the potential for addiction. to the young people who are listening today, you need to know this. you need to understand this. everybody does. again, if we are going to turn the tide, we have to change the way we deal with it to ensure that people are getting the education they need to avoid getting into the funnel of addiction in the first place. this program called cara also increases the availability naloxone, or narcan, which is very important. it has long-term recovery grants, including grants for recovery colleges, recovery universities. in other words, there are programs within colleges and universities to help on recovery because unfortunately we are finding that many of our students need these recovery programs as they are trying to work through their addiction. it also supports recovery high schools and increases eligibility for alternatives to incarceration--drug courts and veterans courts. so instead of putting people in jail for using these drugs, we say: let's do a diversion. if you stay sober and clean, you will stay out of jail and we will get you into treatment. as i have seen around our state, these programs can help people get back on their feet. these are critical changes. the experts who helped us write this legislation over the last 3\1/2\ years, who came here to washington, where we held four different conferences on this issue and brought in the best minds, the best practices, tell us they believe this legislation will make a difference in our communities day to day. of course, it is up to the administration to actually implement this aggressively. congress has done its work to pass these new programs, to pass this legislation. now it shifts over to the executive branch to administer it. there is no excuse that the funding is not there because we were able to provide this funding. it is an exception to a normal cr, but we got the $37 million of funding in to begin to get these programs up and running so we can begin to turn the tide on this addiction epidemic. there are some aspects of the legislation that are already working that don't require a new program or setting up a new program. for instance, nurse practitioners and physician's assistants are now permitted to be involved in administering suboxone at treatment clinics around the country. we should get that up and going now. that shouldn't require a lot of time, effort, and new programs. earlier this week, i had the opportunity to visit a fire station in norwood, oh. this is a community of about 19,000 people that has had 56 overdoses since june 1. that is one small town in ohio with 56 overdoses just since this summer. i met with law enforcement, i met with

they showed me a video of a young man who was overdosing. they showed me a video of police officers and then firefighters administering narcan-- not once, not twice, but three times. they showed how he was brought back to life. it was tough to watch, but firefighters and other first responders, police officers, see that every single day. every 3 hours someone dies of an overdose in ohio, but every 3 hours many more are saved by the administering of naloxone and narcan to bring them back to life. as they are doing in norwood, oh, the key is to intervene with that person, their family, and their friends and get that person into treatment so first responders are not administering narcan again the next week or sometimes even the next day. over the last 4 years, the number of heroin overdoses has tripled. let me repeat that. over the last 4 years, the number of heroin overdoses has tripled. sadly, there is reason to believe this trend is continuing. even though our first responders save the vast majority of those who overdose in ohio, in ohio we are losing more lives every day. we have already [[page s6259]] had more drug overdoses and more drug overdose deaths this year, at the end of september, than we had all of last year. of course, the numbers don't really tell the story. this story is about people. it is about dreams that have been shattered. it is about

CREC-2016-09-29-pt1-PgS6260,CREC-2016-09-29,114,WILLSEYE HOSPITAL,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6260-S6261] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] WILLSEYE HOSPITAL Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I wanted to come to the floor today, as I did last week, to speak once again about WillsEye Hospital in Philadelphia. When I was here last week, I was talking about the hospital itself and the truly excellent work that is done at that hospital and, unfortunately, to talk as well about the unfair treatment that hospital is receiving from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. We know it by the acronym CMS. CMS is using an arbitrary ratio of the number of inpatients and outpatients to make the argument--faulty though it is--that WillsEye is not a hospital and should be an ambulatory surgery center, which could have drastic implications and ultimately force WillsEye Hospital to close down. This hospital is almost 200 years old. Last week, WillsEye Hospital started an online petition on change.org so people could show their support for the hospital. I wanted to share some of those comments today with Members of the Senate. These online postings, of course, don't just come from Philadelphia or Pennsylvania. They come from States across the Northeast and even beyond. Here are just a couple of examples. Jack Croft from Lansdale, PA, which is not too far from Philadelphia, said: I owe my life, my right eye, and my sight to Wills Eye Hospital and its brilliant ocular oncology team. Losing federal designation as a hospital would have a devastating effect on the lives of thousands, many of them children, who desperately need the specialized expertise of Wills. So said Jack Croft. Ayan Chatterjee from Philadelphia said the following: Wills Eye Hospital provides care to so many complex patients from all across the world. It is not just a ``surgi- center.'' State regulators got it right but Federal regulators should revisit this. We continue to hope they will do that--my words, in addition to the comments. Kathleen O'Brien from Vestal, NY--not from Pennsylvania--said: I've needed Wills since 2005 to treat and monitor my ocular melanoma. They are the best in the world for my very rare cancer. Medicare is my primary insurance provider. It makes no logical sense to take away this vital institution to the thousands of children and adults they not only treat but save lives. Erica Roache from Cape May Court House, NJ, said: This hospital provides specialized care not available anywhere else. Doctors at Wills Eye quickly diagnosed and successfully treated my daughter's rare eye condition that had been misdiagnosed for years by other less specialized doctors. The possibility of closing this world class hospital due to senseless bureaucracy is just unthinkable. So says Erica. Here are two more. This is Mike Stanley from Overland Park, KS--half a country away from Pennsylvania: We live in Overland Park, KS, and for the past 2 years have been flying from Kansas City to Philly for treatment for the retinoblastoma eye cancer you refer to. He is referring to comments I had made when I was at WillsEye Hospital. I continue on with Mike Stanley's comments: Thankfully, my daughter is now 4 and in remission and we travel back to Philly next week and Wills. Please let us know what we can do to support CMS changing how they classify Wills Eye so we and others can continue to get the best care in the world. Alexis Butler, from Chelsea, MI, said: I'm signing because as a volunteer at Camp Sunshine at Sebago Lake I've met many children who have been saved by Wills Eye Hospital. Their cases aren't handled much by other hospitals as well as they are at Wills. It needs to survive. So said Alexis from the State of Michigan. I will do one more. The final comments come from Nancy Cotton from Marlton, NJ. Please do not be blinded by rubber stamp bureaucracy. Not everything fits neatly into arbitrary slots--visit Wills Eye and look in the faces of those whose vision was restored, saved, as well as the parents whose children's very lives were saved. This institution fills a desperate need for highly specialized service! Save Wills Eye!! Notice she uses exclamation points--actually two exclamation points at the end. That is how Nancy Cotton from New Jersey ends her comments. So you can see from these comments that these are real people talking about their real lives or that of a family member--sometimes a child-- and commenting from the vantage point of what they had experienced in terms of the benefits that WillsEye Hospital has provided. I hope CMS is listening--and not just to these comments but to the many others that have been sent in. None of these comments are compulsory. None of these comments are part of some organized political effort. People are just responding in a very authentic and substantial way. This is very rare to have this kind of commentary that is so specific about how WillsEye Hospital has made life better for people across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, people across the northeastern part of the United States and well beyond that, as we can document from the comments from Kansas. So what we are trying to do is to work with WillsEye and CMS to work this out and to remove a bureaucratic barrier or obstacle in the way of keeping WillsEye Hospital open as a hospital so that it can deliver the kind of eye care--the kind of lifesaving eye care--that not only these people experience but that I experienced myself as a father. My wife and I had a daughter, and, fortunately, she is doing very well now. She is out of college. But she had a moment in time when she was a little girl where she would have lost eyesight in one of her eyes were it not for WillsEye Hospital. That is a fact. That is documented. We know that. So I join in those comments we heard today, and I will continue to make them a part of the Record. We are working to save this hospital. To say it is a world-class institution is a vast understatement. It has affected so many lives, including my own. So CMS got this wrong. They have an obligation to get it right, to fix it, so that WillsEye Hospital can continue into the future. [[Page S6261]] We are grateful so many people are taking the time to go to change.org and focus on all the benefits of WillsEye Hospital. I will continue to make this case a high priority for the work I do, the work our office does. Time is running short now for the hospital. CMS has some work to do to make sure we get the result not only that I want but one that I know people across our Commonwealth and our country want. Madam President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6260-S6261] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] WILLSEYE HOSPITAL Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I wanted to come to the floor today, as I did last week, to speak once again about WillsEye Hospital in Philadelphia. When I was here last week, I was talking about the hospital itself and the truly excellent work that is done at that hospital and, unfortunately, to talk as well about the unfair treatment that hospital is receiving from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. We know it by the acronym CMS. CMS is using an arbitrary ratio of the number of inpatients and outpatients to make the argument--faulty though it is--that WillsEye is not a hospital and should be an ambulatory surgery center, which could have drastic implications and ultimately force WillsEye Hospital to close down. This hospital is almost 200 years old. Last week, WillsEye Hospital started an online petition on change.org so people could show their support for the hospital.

Madam President, I just came from a discussion on the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the damage it will do to our country. We have had 25 years of trade policy that has cost jobs in places like Lorain, OH, Cleveland, OH, and Dayton, OH. We know these trade agreements pull down worker safety standards, environmental rules and protections, and food safety laws and rules. We know they cost us jobs. I know what has happened in my State. I see what has happened in places like Omaha, the Presiding Officer's State, and all over our country. I appreciate Senator McConnell and Speaker Ryan saying they don't plan to bring the Trans-Pacific Partnership up for a vote in the lameduck session of Congress. I believe it would be a bit underhanded to do that when the public is speaking pretty loudly that these trade agreements don't work. One part that in particular affects my State is something called rules of origin in the auto industry, where in order to qualify for a tariff reduction or tariff elimination to sell products, to sell a car, under NAFTA--NAFTA was a very flawed agreement. I helped lead the opposition. We almost defeated it down the hall in the House of Representatives. To qualify for NAFTA tariff reduction, removal, elimination, the car had to be mostly made--60 percent, more or less-- in one of the three countries, the United States, Mexico or Canada. Under the TPP, Trans-Pacific Partnership, there are 12 countries, very disparate countries--Peru, the United States, Mexico, Canada, wealthy countries, Vietnam, poor countries. Under the rules of origin and TPP, a car can be more than half made elsewhere, like China, and then still be sold into the United States or sold into Canada or Mexico. Fundamentally, what this means is, it has created a loophole you can drive my Jeep Cherokee, made by union workers 150 miles from my home in Toledo, OH--you can drive a Jeep Cherokee through this loophole. This will undermine the auto industry, it will undermine the supply chain, it will mean loss of jobs from auto assembly in Youngstown and Toledo and Sharonville, to other kinds--whether it is glass, tires, the steel in the cars. All this will undermine those jobs. I again thank Senator McConnell and Speaker Ryan as they have promised not to bring up this agreement. I hope they are men of their word. It is a disaster for our country. It is bad for our country. I appreciate that both Presidential candidates--one more knowledgeable than the other, perhaps, about trade policy--have opposed the Trans- Pacific Partnership. I close with this. I see candidates make all kinds of claims about their position on trade. I see all kinds of candidates in their own private businesses doing certain things, but I know we can make products in the United States of America. The shoes I have were made by workers in Maine and Massachusetts. The suit I wear was made by union workers in a company 11 miles from my home in Cleveland. American workers just want a level playing field. They just want the opportunity to compete. They want the opportunity to make things. We know how to do that in this country. Our trade policy should reflect that. Madam President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.

Under the TPP, Trans-Pacific Partnership, there are 12 countries, very disparate countries--Peru, the United States, Mexico, Canada, wealthy countries, Vietnam, poor countries. Under the rules of origin and TPP, a car can be more than half made elsewhere, like China, and then still be sold into the United States or sold into Canada or Mexico. Fundamentally, what this means is, it has created a loophole you can drive my Jeep Cherokee, made by union workers 150 miles from my home in Toledo, OH--you can drive a Jeep Cherokee through this loophole. This will undermine the auto industry, it will undermine the supply chain, it will mean loss of jobs from auto assembly in Youngstown and Toledo and Sharonville, to other kinds--whether it is glass, tires, the steel in the cars. All this will undermine those jobs. I again thank Senator McConnell and Speaker Ryan as they have promised not to bring up this agreement. I hope they are men of their word. It is a disaster for our country. It is bad for our country. I appreciate that both Presidential candidates--one more knowledgeable than the other, perhaps, about trade policy--have opposed the Trans- Pacific Partnership. I close with this. I see candidates make all kinds of claims about their position on trade. I see all kinds of candidates in their own private businesses doing certain things, but I know we can make products in the United States of America. The shoes I have were made by workers in Maine and Massachusetts. The suit I wear was made by union workers in a company 11 miles from my home in Cleveland. American workers just want a level playing field. They just want the opportunity to compete. They want the opportunity to make things. We know how to do that in this country. Our trade policy should reflect that. Madam President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.

Madam President, in honor of National Manufacturing Day on October 7, I would like to recognize the nearly 150,000 Coloradans who work for the 6,000 manufacturers across the State and contribute $20 billion annually to the State's economy. Colorado manufacturers contribute their ingenuity and talent to support growth in the aerospace, energy, bioscience, defense, food and beverage, agriculture, apparel and many other industries. In 2015, they exported over $8 billion worth of U.S.-made goods overseas. Manufacturing leaders in Colorado are continually looking for innovative ways to produce high-quality products. They have developed strong public-private-university partnerships through the Alliance for the Development of Additive Processing Technologies, ADAPT, Center at Colorado School of Mines, led by the Manufacturer's Edge--Colorado's NIST Manufacturing Extension Partnership--and the Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation Institute National Research Initiative at the University of Colorado-Boulder. From Oliver Manufacturing in La Junta to Woodward in Fort Collins to Lockheed Martin in Littleton to Reynolds Polymer in Grand Junction, manufacturers play a significant role in our local communities, providing high-skilled jobs and opportunities for suppliers and service providers.

DITLOW III Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, today I wish to recognize and thank Mr. Clarence M. Ditlow III for his commitment to protecting the American people. Through a lifetime of work improving automotive and safety laws, Mr. Ditlow has helped save thousands of lives and prevented many more injuries than would otherwise have occurred. A tireless champion for consumers, his work has resulted in better government oversight of automakers, the installation of key safety features, and the exposure of safety defects in millions of cars, SUVs, and other trucks. A 1965 chemical engineering graduate of Lehigh University, Mr. Ditlow pivoted to the legal profession following the completion of a JD from Georgetown University in 1970 and an LLM from Harvard Law School in 1971. Since then, he has been instrumental in improving auto safety, reliability, and efficiency as executive director of the Center for Auto Safety. Mr. Ditlow's discovery of numerous automotive defects, combined with his persistent pressure on safety agencies and automakers alike, led to the removal of many unsafe vehicles from the road. His direct efforts led to the automotive recalls of 6.7 million Chevrolets with defective engine mounts, 15 million Firestone 500 tires, 1.5 million Ford Pintos and 2 million Jeeps with exploding gas tanks, 3 million Evenflo child seats with defective latches, 7 million Toyotas because of sudden acceleration defects, 2 million GM vehicles with defective ignition switches, and over 30 million Takata airbag inflators. He also led consumer efforts to get ``lemon laws'' passed in all 50 States. I offer my sincere appreciation to Mr. Clarence M. Ditlow III and the Center for Automotive Safety for indefatigable dedication to auto safety and vigilance in uncovering automotive safety threats. Clarence demonstrates the impact a devoted industry watchdog can have on informing the public and saving lives. I am grateful for his years of collaboration with and assistance to Members of Congress, Federal and State safety agencies, and a myriad of other stakeholders, to improve automotive and public safety. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S6262] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO CLARENCE M.

CREC-2016-09-29-pt1-PgS6262-3,CREC-2016-09-29,114,TRIBUTE TO DONDA MORGAN,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S6262] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO DONDA MORGAN Mr. UDALL. Madam President, I wish to say a heartfelt thank you and congratulations to Donda Morgan, who retired at the end of last month after 17 years and 8 months with my office. I do this knowing that she shies away from fuss and attention, preferring to stay quiet and behind the scenes. But she deserves this recognition for her service to me-- and especially to the people of New Mexico. Donda was born and raised in the Clovis-Portales area of Eastern New Mexico. She graduated from Eastern New Mexico University and worked in public service for over two decades. She came to Washington in 1995 after a nearly 10-year stint with Capitol Government Reports, a Santa Fe publication. She went to work for one of my predecessors in the House of Representatives, former U.S. Representative Bill Richardson, until he was appointed Energy Secretary. So I knew she was well qualified for the job. When I was elected in 1998, she joined my new congressional office, starting almost on the first day of the new year, January 3, 1999. Donda began as the manager of my office operations, managing the office budget and then my schedule--which I am sure was no easy task. As one newspaper reporter once wrote, she was in charge of ``everything that [came] in and out of the . . . office from pencils and pens to letterhead and business cards.'' She served with me throughout my tenure in the House and then moved over to the Senate staff as my executive assistant and scheduler when I was elected to this body in 2009. I admire many things about Donda, but perhaps the most important is that she served with the highest integrity. As my assistant and scheduler, she worked directly with New Mexicans who came to my Washington office for appointments or to check in with me or my staff. Donda was always particularly careful to make sure that everyone was treated the same. In a sense, she was the face of my Senate office, scheduling and greeting everyone--celebrated or not--with equal parts of graciousness and firmness, while keeping the train running on time, a daunting task in a Senate office. She firmly appreciated that her first responsibility was to the people of New Mexico. My constituents from New Mexico got to know and love her. I have heard them comment that they were glad that she was my scheduler because they knew she would try her best to make sure they had an opportunity to see me. Donda has a strong work ethic and was an incredible coworker and team player, always willing to help where she could. She also has a quirky sense of style. My staff especially enjoyed hearing ZZ Top and AC/DC playing from her office while she worked. She was known for wearing colorful hightop sneakers, chosen with the help of her beloved grandson Aiden. Donda also has a fondness for certain celebrities, and while she shied away from the fuss, she enjoyed seeing some of the Hollywood stars who sometimes visit Congress to talk about issues they care about. But, more than anything, Donda appreciates good, hard work. My dad used to say it was important not just to ``get it done--but get it done right.'' And that fits Donda to a T. She had a demanding job. To use a metaphor, she was a juggler, and she managed to do it with humor and unfailing commitment. Time, which she managed for my office with such skill and aplomb, has now brought her to a much deserved retirement, which I know she will manage with equal grace and spirit. I thank her on behalf of my office and the people of New Mexico. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S6262] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO DONDA MORGAN Mr. UDALL.

Madam President, I wish to say a heartfelt thank you and congratulations to Donda Morgan, who retired at the end of last month after 17 years and 8 months with my office. I do this knowing that she shies away from fuss and attention, preferring to stay quiet and behind the scenes. But she deserves this recognition for her service to me-- and especially to the people of New Mexico. Donda was born and raised in the Clovis-Portales area of Eastern New Mexico. She graduated from Eastern New Mexico University and worked in public service for over two decades. She came to Washington in 1995 after a nearly 10-year stint with Capitol Government Reports, a Santa Fe publication. She went to work for one of my predecessors in the House of Representatives, former U.S. Representative Bill Richardson, until he was appointed Energy Secretary. So I knew she was well qualified for the job. When I was elected in 1998, she joined my new congressional office, starting almost on the first day of the new year, January 3, 1999. Donda began as the manager of my office operations, managing the office budget and then my schedule--which I am sure was no easy task. As one newspaper reporter once wrote, she was in charge of ``everything that [came] in and out of the . . . office from pencils and pens to letterhead and business cards.'' She served with me throughout my tenure in the House and then moved over to the Senate staff as my executive assistant and scheduler when I was elected to this body in 2009. I admire many things about Donda, but perhaps the most important is that she served with the highest integrity. As my assistant and scheduler, she worked directly with New Mexicans who came to my Washington office for appointments or to check in with me or my staff. Donda was always particularly careful to make sure that everyone was treated the same. In a sense, she was the face of my Senate office, scheduling and greeting everyone--celebrated or not--with equal parts of graciousness and firmness, while keeping the train running on time, a daunting task in a Senate office. She firmly appreciated that her first responsibility was to the people of New Mexico. My constituents from New Mexico got to know and love her. I have heard them comment that they were glad that she was my scheduler because they knew she would try her best to make sure they had an opportunity to see me. Donda has a strong work ethic and was an incredible coworker and team player, always willing to help where she could. She also has a quirky sense of style.

Madam President, today I congratulate the Planned Parenthood Federation of America on a century's commitment to protecting women's health and making that health care a right, not a privilege. I have been proud to stand with Planned Parenthood against a tide of relentless political attacks, and I look forward to supporting this organization as it continues to empower all Americans to take control of their health for years to come. When advocates opened the first birth control health clinic in the United States in 1916, they had a simple but bold goal: to ensure that all women, regardless of where they were born or where they live, have access to the information and resources they need to lead strong and healthy lives. Over the next hundred years, Planned Parenthood worked to cement the idea that preventive and reproductive health care is not a privilege afforded to the few but a key to leading a full, healthy life that should be available to every American. In Ohio, our 28 Planned Parenthood clinics educate and provide care to tens of thousands of men and women each year, many of whom have nowhere else to turn. The lives and struggles of those patients are what motivate the dedicated staff and volunteers at these health clinics. And they do this critical work in the face of constant threats and attacks from all levels of government. Just this year, the State of Ohio passed an ill-conceived law that, had it not been overturned by a Federal district court, would have jeopardized access to preventive care and ceased operation of a prominent infant mortality prevention program. I get letters all the time from constituents who rely on Planned Parenthood. One Ohioan wrote to me saying, ``I was so amazed by the support for women that Planned Parenthood provided that I volunteered for them for years,'' while another wrote, ``Planned Parenthood not only provided a well-rounded education, in which I had received none previously, but they also provided services that I would not have had access to otherwise.'' I have even heard that Planned Parenthood ``saved the life of my best friend when she found a lump in her breast and she had no health insurance.'' We need to listen to the voices of these women and remember that Planned Parenthood remains a vital health provider for so many. It is a strong advocate for its patients, and [[Page S6262]] further attempts to defund or destabilize this organization will result in more undiagnosed cancers, more untreated illnesses, and more unintended pregnancies. We have seen the incredible progress our country can make when women make their own health care decisions and follow their dreams, and we know what an important role Planned Parenthood plays in making that possible. Congratulations to Planned Parenthood Federation of America on its 100th anniversary and for the important work its members do in Ohio's communities and across the country every day. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6261-S6262] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING PLANNED PARENTHOOD FEDERATION OF AMERICA Mr. BROWN.

Madam President, today I wish to recognize Farm Rescue for assisting 400 farm and ranch families during times of crisis. Farm Rescue provides assistance to farming families who are suffering from a major injury, illness, or natural disaster by lending a helping hand with planting, harvesting crops, or providing haying assistance. They also assist producers with hauling hay and grain if a farmer or rancher cannot do these critical tasks. Farm Rescue's relief efforts have come in times of natural disaster, like tornadoes, and personal crisis, such as cancer treatments, spinal cord injuries, and lost limbs. In rural communities, it is common for folks to help one another when in need, and this organization epitomizes that spirit. Farm Rescue was founded by Bill Gross in 2006, a native North Dakota farm boy who, while working as a full-time UPS pilot, donates his free time to run this organization. Mr. Gross has molded Farm Rescue into a one-of-a- kind nonprofit organization whose sole purpose is to aid farmers and ranchers who need a little help in the midst of a crisis. Farm Rescue actually does the critical labor the farmer or rancher needs to get done, while the assisted producer provides the crop inputs, like seed, fertilizer, and fuel Since 2006, Farm Rescue has assisted hundreds of farm families in the Midwest, including North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, Montana, and Minnesota. This year alone, Farm Rescue has already helped 50 families, and they are still in the field assisting more. Its operations are primarily completed by a volunteer labor force that come from all over the country to help, and many of those volunteers are retired farmers seeking to lend their help and expertise to those in need. Farm Rescue's first case in 2006 was to assist a farmer whose hand was severed in an auger accident. In 2012, they harvested for a family near Wyndmere, ND, marking their 200th case, after the farmer fell off his semitrailer and broke vertebrae in his neck. One hundred cases later, in 2014, Farm Rescue helped a Fergus Falls, MN, man with harvest while he underwent treatment for blood cancer. Two years later, Farm Rescue is now completing its 400th case by enabling a family with a loved one suffering from cancer to complete harvest. It must be a great relief to farming and ranching families to know that, if an unexpected medical diagnosis complicates spring planting or multiple lengthy trips to doctor appointments make harvesting the fall crop near impossible, there is an organization that will coordinate volunteers to come out and lend a neighborly helping hand. Farm Rescue is making a positive contribution to the agriculture community all over the United States, and I am proud to be able to recognize this organization. Farm Rescue is a powerful reminder of what Americans can achieve when they work together to help each other in times of need. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S6263] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING FARM RESCUE Mr. HOEVEN.

This year alone, Farm Rescue has already helped 50 families, and they are still in the field assisting more. Its operations are primarily completed by a volunteer labor force that come from all over the country to help, and many of those volunteers are retired farmers seeking to lend their help and expertise to those in need. Farm Rescue's first case in 2006 was to assist a farmer whose hand was severed in an auger accident. In 2012, they harvested for a family near Wyndmere, ND, marking their 200th case, after the farmer fell off his semitrailer and broke vertebrae in his neck. One hundred cases later, in 2014, Farm Rescue helped a Fergus Falls, MN, man with harvest while he underwent treatment for blood cancer. Two years later, Farm Rescue is now completing its 400th case by enabling a family with a loved one suffering from cancer to complete harvest. It must be a great relief to farming and ranching families to know that, if an unexpected medical diagnosis complicates spring planting or multiple lengthy trips to doctor appointments make harvesting the fall crop near impossible, there is an organization that will coordinate volunteers to come out and lend a neighborly helping hand. Farm Rescue is making a positive contribution to the agriculture community all over the United States, and I am proud to be able to recognize this organization. Farm Rescue is a powerful reminder of what Americans can achieve when they work together to help each other in times of need. ____________________",package_114_206.csv,3143,3143,3217,"[congressional record volume 162, number 148 (thursday, september 29, 2016)] [senate] [page s6263] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] recognizing farm rescue mr. hoeven. madam president, today i wish to recognize farm rescue for assisting 400 farm and ranch families during times of crisis. farm rescue provides assistance to farming families who are suffering from a major injury, illness, or natural disaster by lending a helping hand with planting, harvesting crops, or providing haying assistance. they also assist producers with hauling hay and grain if a farmer or rancher cannot do these critical tasks. farm rescue's relief efforts have come in times of natural disaster, like tornadoes, and personal crisis, such as cancer treatments, spinal cord injuries, and lost limbs. in rural communities, it is common for folks to help one another when in need, and this organization epitomizes that spirit. farm rescue was founded by bill gross in 2006, a native north dakota farm boy who, while working as a full-time ups pilot, donates his free time to run this organization. mr. gross has molded farm rescue into a one-of-a- kind nonprofit organization whose sole purpose is to aid farmers and ranchers who need a little help in the midst of a crisis. farm rescue actually does the critical labor the farmer or rancher needs to get done, while the assisted producer provides the crop inputs, like seed, fertilizer, and fuel since 2006, farm rescue has assisted hundreds of farm families in the midwest, including north dakota, south dakota, iowa, montana, and minnesota. this year alone, farm rescue has already helped 50 families, and they are still in the field assisting more. its operations are primarily completed by a volunteer labor force that come from all over the country to help, and many of those volunteers are retired farmers seeking to lend their help and expertise to those in need. farm rescue's first case in 2006 was to assist a farmer whose hand was severed in an auger accident. in 2012, they harvested for a family near wyndmere, nd, marking their 200th case, after the farmer fell off his semitrailer and broke vertebrae in his neck. one hundred cases later, in 2014, farm rescue helped a fergus falls, mn, man with harvest while he underwent treatment for blood cancer. two years later, farm rescue is now completing its 400th case by enabling a family with a loved one suffering from cancer to complete harvest. it must be a great relief to farming and ranching families to know that, if an unexpected medical diagnosis complicates spring planting or multiple lengthy trips to doctor appointments make harvesting the fall crop near impossible, there is an organization that will coordinate volunteers to come out and lend a neighborly helping hand. farm rescue is making a positive contribution to the agriculture community all over the united states, and i am proud to be able to recognize this organization. farm rescue is a powerful reminder of what americans can achieve when they work together to help each other in times of need. ____________________",3143

CREC-2016-09-29-pt1-PgS6265-3,CREC-2016-09-29,114,RECOGNIZING LARSON CHIROPRACTIC,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S6265] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING LARSON CHIROPRACTIC Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, from time to time, I will be coming forward to recognize a small business from Alaska that has made contributions to our community. This month, I wish to recognize Larson Chiropractic, a small business in Wasilla, AK, that does big things. Larson Chiropractic exemplifies the things that small businesses can do to benefit a community, a State, and our country. First, let me say that small business truly is the backbone of our economy and our communities, and we should be doing all we can do in DC to support small businesses and the entrepreneurship and innovation that creates them. Small businesses owners and those who work for them have ties to the community. They know community needs, and they work to fulfill those needs. Larson Chiropractic is a family business committed to improving the health care and lifestyles of Mat-Su Valley residents. Dr. Dan Larson started the company in 1991, and now his son, Dr. Kris Larson, owns Larson Chiropractic and Back in Action Physical Therapy. The company is fully Alaskan-owned and operated, and though it is small, the effect on the local community is anything but. Larson Chiropractic focuses on family-oriented chiropractic health care that emphasizes effective pain relief without the use of drugs and promoting wellness care through prevention, specializing in sports treatment. Their community service centers around their commitment to the area high school athletes. The business is also heavily involved in the annual food drive during Hunger Action Month. Dr. Kris Larson volunteers countless hours at high school sporting events, dealing with injuries on scene, free of charge and, preventing the need for expensive treatment and recovery time later. The staff have also become regular fixtures at sporting events throughout the region, donating time and resources to sporting programs in each high school. Even retired founder Dr. Dan fills in at the clinic when needed and during September assists student athletes and coaches from Wasilla High School every Friday night. From football season, he transitions into basketball season, often traveling with the teams to make sure they are always ready to compete. Dr. Dan also started the Doc Larson Roundball Classic Tournament at the school to give athletes exposure to new people, more basketball, and to give back to the community. Larson Chiropractic and Back in Action Physical Therapy staff a therapy room at Wasilla High for the entire tournament, providing free care to all athletes present, no matter where their team is from. Finally, Larson Chiropractic cares about the community beyond sports medicine. For Hunger Action Month, the business hosts a food drive to help residents of the Mat-Su Valley, covering the cost of admission to the Wasilla High varsity football match-up for anyone who donates two or more food items and continuing the drive in the clinic's lobby and waiting area. They also educate their patients, placing ``Real People, Real Stories'' displays inside examination rooms providing the stories of community members who suffer food insecurity and how food drives help to ensure brighter futures for those in need. Larson Chiropractic cares about the community and cares about the community caring about the community. They have demonstrated a tireless, selfless drive to give back and an inspirational enthusiasm. Their commitment to creating better lives for the residents of the Mat- Su area has benefitted this Alaskan community for many years and hopefully will continue to do so for many more. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S6265] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING LARSON CHIROPRACTIC Mr. SULLIVAN.

Mr. UDALL. Madam President, I wish to commemorate the life of Justice Dan Sosa, Jr. On September 4, New Mexico lost an accomplished jurist, combat veteran, and champion of the Hispanic community. It is with great sympathy and respect that I honor this beloved Las Crucen. Justice Sosa dedicated his long life to serving others. And thanks to news coverage of his life, I am able to share some details about his background and history. Shortly after enrolling at New Mexico A&M, he enlisted in the Air Force. When he returned home from World War II with 35 successful combat missions under his belt, Justice Sosa finished his undergraduate degree and spent a year teaching at Mesilla Elementary before enrolling in the University of New Mexico Law School. It was there that he met and married the love of his life, Rita. After graduating from law school, he returned to Las Cruces to start his own practice. He served as an assistant district attorney and city judge before being elected district attorney of Dona Ana, Otero, and Lincoln Counties in 1956, becoming the first Hispanic to ever serve in that position. Justice Sosa's efforts to break down barriers for fellow Hispanics went far beyond his personal trailblazing. After completing two terms as district attorney, in 1965, he helped found the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, or MALDEF, an organization aimed at protecting the legal rights of Hispanics in America and promoting educational opportunities. Justice Sosa is best known for his tenure on the New Mexico State Supreme Court. He was appointed to the court in 1975 and left as its chief justice in 1991. He remains one of the longest serving justices in the State court's history. Throughout his storied career, Justice Sosa never forgot about the Las Cruces community he called home. In fact, he passed away in the very same adobe house he was born in on November 12, 1923. His commitment to the [[Page S6266]] principles he learned from his family and community guided his great life and helped him build a towering example for generations of New Mexicans. Justice Sosa leaves behind his wife, Rita, his sister Lucia, 7 children, 26 grandchildren, and 31 great-grandchildren, and I extend my deepest condolences to his family and friends. He served his community, his State, and his country with honor. New Mexico will miss Justice Dan Sosa, Jr., a humble and dedicated public servant. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6265-S6266] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING DAN SOSA, JR.

Mr. UDALL. Madam President, I wish to commemorate the life of Justice Dan Sosa, Jr. On September 4, New Mexico lost an accomplished jurist, combat veteran, and champion of the Hispanic community. It is with great sympathy and respect that I honor this beloved Las Crucen. Justice Sosa dedicated his long life to serving others. And thanks to news coverage of his life, I am able to share some details about his background and history. Shortly after enrolling at New Mexico A&M, he enlisted in the Air Force. When he returned home from World War II with 35 successful combat missions under his belt, Justice Sosa finished his undergraduate degree and spent a year teaching at Mesilla Elementary before enrolling in the University of New Mexico Law School. It was there that he met and married the love of his life, Rita. After graduating from law school, he returned to Las Cruces to start his own practice. He served as an assistant district attorney and city judge before being elected district attorney of Dona Ana, Otero, and Lincoln Counties in 1956, becoming the first Hispanic to ever serve in that position. Justice Sosa's efforts to break down barriers for fellow Hispanics went far beyond his personal trailblazing. After completing two terms as district attorney, in 1965, he helped found the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, or MALDEF, an organization aimed at protecting the legal rights of Hispanics in America and promoting educational opportunities. Justice Sosa is best known for his tenure on the New Mexico State Supreme Court. He was appointed to the court in 1975 and left as its chief justice in 1991. He remains one of the longest serving justices in the State court's history. Throughout his storied career, Justice Sosa never forgot about the Las Cruces community he called home. In fact, he passed away in the very same adobe house he was born in on November 12, 1923. His commitment to the [[Page S6266]] principles he learned from his family and community guided his great life and helped him build a towering example for generations of New Mexicans. Justice Sosa leaves behind his wife, Rita, his sister Lucia, 7 children, 26 grandchildren, and 31 great-grandchildren, and I extend my deepest condolences to his family and friends.

CREC-2016-09-29-pt1-PgS6268,CREC-2016-09-29,114,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIIONS,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6268-S6273] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIIONS By Mr. DAINES: S. 3460. A bill to amend title 54, United States Code, to provide certain limitations on the designation and use of national monuments; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. [[Page S6269]] There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: S. 3460 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Local Community and Sportsmen Input in Monuments Act''. SEC. 2. DESIGNATION AND USE OF NATIONAL MONUMENTS.

A bill to provide incremental increases to the salary threshold for exemptions for executive, administrative, professional, outside sales, and computer employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, and for other purposes; read the first time. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, Senate offices have been hearing about something called the overtime rule on a daily basis. We are hearing about it from colleges, universities, Boy Scout troops, church camps, other nonprofits, employers, and employees who don't like to be suddenly considered employees who punch a timecard. Today, I would like to talk about action that Congress can take to change the effect of the overtime rule the administration issued that will go into effect in December unless we do something. The Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Lankford, and the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, introduced legislation that would delay for 6 months the implementation of the rule. I cosponsored that legislation and I fully support it. Yesterday, the House of Representatives passed a bill with that same language which would delay for 6 months the implementation of the rule. That would be my preferred solution. Today I am introducing another piece of legislation that addresses the problems with the overtime rule that I hope will gather more bipartisan support. A similar bill was introduced in the House by Democrat Representative Kurt Schrader of Oregon and is cosponsored by 10 Democrats and 7 Republicans. My hope is that when we come back in November, Senators on both sides of the aisle will have heard from their Boy Scout troops, from their colleges and universities, from their restaurants, and from their employees, who say: Wait a minute, this overtime rule makes no sense the way it is being implemented. Do something in November to change its negative effect on our country. I am introducing a bill today with the cosponsorship of Senator Collins of Maine, Senator Lankford of Oklahoma, Senator Scott of South Carolina, and Senator Flake of Arizona that will protect America's nonprofits, churches, colleges, and communities from the effect of the administration's overtime rule that will go into effect on December 1 unless we act. When we talk about employers that will be affected by overtime, we are talking about Operation Smile, which is a charity that funds cleft palate operations for children. Operation Smile says this rule may cost them at least 3,000 surgeries a year. The effect of this rule may mean 3,000 children won't have surgeries each year for cleft palates because of the cost of this regulation. We are talking about the Great Smoky Mountain Council of Boy Scouts. That is my home Boy Scout council where I grew up and where I live. They are telling me the new rule will result in about $100,000 in annual costs because during certain seasons employees staff weekend camping trips, which mean longer hours. That is what you do in Boy Scouts, Mr. President--you go on camping trips. And they are not 8-hour trips most of the time. If you are going to start saying they have to pay overtime to Scout masters and others you are going to have fewer boys and girls having a chance for Scouting. Senator Isakson of Georgia spoke on the floor about a phone call he received from the pastor at Johnson Ferry Baptist Church in Marietta, one of the largest Baptist churches in Georgia. That church provides daycare, early childhood development, and sports activities at Vacation Bible School, a 24/7 program for underprivileged kids in the Atlanta area. Under the overtime rule that goes into effect in December, a camp counselor for their Vacation Bible School will have to be paid overtime for many hours of the day when they are with the children, even if they are sleeping. So this rule could price the Johnson Ferry Baptist Church out of the business of providing Bible school church camp for underprivileged children. So there will be fewer cleft palate operations, fewer Scouting opportunities, and fewer church camp opportunities for underprivileged children. Here's what I mean by the overtime rule: Hourly workers in this country are usually paid overtime, but salaried workers generally don't earn overtime unless they are making below a threshold set by the Labor Department and required by the Fair Labor Standards Act. Today that threshold is a little over $23,000. This new rule issued by the Obama administration just 4 months ago raises the threshold from just over $23,000 to over $47,000 all at once on December 1. In other words, in 3 months it will double. This is a 100-percent increase and on December 1, employers will have had only about 6 months to prepare for this, reclassify employees, put time clock systems in place, adjust workers' schedules, and find new revenue to pay for all of this. It has thrown small businesses and colleges into a panic in the State of Tennessee. One poll released this month found that 49 percent of business owners were not aware of the rule that goes into effect in 3 months. The legislation I am introducing today would stretch out over 5 years the administration's increase in the salary threshold for overtime pay. I have not met many people who don't believe the threshold ought to go up. I have not met many people who think that it ought to be doubled in 6 months and automatically increased every 3 years, or that it should jump so high and all at once. On December 1, under the legislation I am introducing, it would still increase significantly--from $23,660 to $35,984. This is about a 50- percent increase. This bill would modify a rule that many believe goes too high and too fast and will result in employers, nonprofits, colleges, and others cutting workers' hours and limiting their workplace benefits and flexibility, as well as costing students more in tuition. If there is one subject I hear about on the Senate floor, it is Senators from both sides of the aisle saying college costs are too high. Yet the independent colleges and the public colleges of Tennessee have written me and they have detailed how the cost of this rule will have the effect of raising tuition by hundreds of dollars per student. So how can you go around complaining about college tuition increases on the one hand and on the other hand issue a rule that raises college tuition by hundreds of dollars in thousands of schools? [[Page S6270]] My bill will do four things: No. 1, it will modify the rule so that it is phased in over 5 years rather than all at once on December 1. Most people I talk to think it ought to go up, just as I have said, but they do not think it ought to go up all at once. There is no need for that, so phase it in over 5 years. No. 2, make a significant increase on December 1, but then prohibit an increase in 2017 to give employers and employees an opportunity to adjust while our independent government watchdog--the Government Accountability Office, the GAO--studies the impact of the rule on American workers after the first year of implementation. So what I have said is that on December 1, the threshold goes up 50 percent, and then for 1 year it doesn't go up at all while the GAO studies the impact of that increase on colleges, church camps, businesses, workers, and others. No. 3, it would clarify that the administration does not have the authority to automatically increase the overtime threshold, which is currently set to occur automatically every 3 years, starting in 2020. No. 4, it would require a study of the rule's impact after the first year of implementation. If the study finds the impact is negative, the bill will exempt certain employers from future increases--nonprofits, including churches, colleges, and universities; State and local governments; many Medicaid and Medicare eligible facilities, such as nursing homes or facilities serving individuals with disabilities. These are employers who can't just raise prices. They are dependent on tax dollars or on charitable donations. And if they are in trouble because of this rule, our communities will lose critical services-- surgeries for cleft palates, Scouting opportunities, church camps for underprivileged kids, and others. This is not a partisan proposal. My bill is very similar to a bill introduced by House Democrat Kurt Schrader of Oregon and cosponsored by 10 Democrats and 7 Republicans. So my hope is that our Democratic colleagues will take a look at this bill and say that this is a reasonable, bipartisan proposal to apply more common sense to the overtime rule when it comes to the employees, employers, and nonprofits that serve our country. Without these bills, on December 1, the salary threshold for overtime pay will more than double, from just over $23,000 to over $47,000. Representative Kurt Schrader, a Democrat, when he introduced his bill, said the following: Since the Department of Labor's immediate phase-in date was announced, we've heard from business owners and their employees who are worried about implementing this increase overnight. Without sufficient time to plan for the increase, cuts and demotions will become inevitable, and workers will actually end up making less than they made before. Democratic Representative Schrader has 10 Democrats as cosponsors, including Congressman Jim Cooper from my State of Tennessee, who said: I am hearing from lots of Middle Tennesseans who are worried about how this new rule will affect them. The overtime rule hadn't been adjusted in years and needed updating. But it's good to make commonsense changes and add flexibility so the rule works for all businesses and workers can actually have a chance to get ahead. We don't want to see lost hours or shifts in job responsibility. I congratulate Senator Collins of Maine and Senator Lankford of Oklahoma for the legislation they introduced to delay the overtime rule's effect for 6 months. I support that bill, and I am glad the House of Representatives last night passed that bill, but I am also introducing this alternative for those in the body--especially my Democratic friends--who might not be willing to delay the implementation of the overtime rule, who believe it should go up, who believe it should go up as high as the President has proposed but not as fast as the President has proposed, and who believe the rule has created a problem for nonprofits, such as the Boy Scouts, or surgeries for cleft palates or church camps. I hope they will seriously consider the proposal I have made today, along with Senators Collins, Lankford, Scott, and Flake. Over the next 5 weeks between now and the election, we will all be home. We will have a chance to see our Boy Scout leaders. We will have a chance to see our doctors and visit our churches. We can go by our colleges and ask how much this is going to raise the tuition at Maryville College, the University of Tennessee, the University of Wyoming, or wherever we may be. And if the fact is that most Americans feel that to impose this salary threshold on December 1 is too high and too fast, there will be two alternatives when we come back. One is to delay the rule for 6 months, and the other is to raise the threshold just as high as the President proposed but do it over 5 years. Take half of the increase in the first year, no increase the second year, and exempt nonprofits, state and local governments, and many Medicare- and Medicaid-eligible facilities if they are negatively affected. This is similar to the commonsense proposal that Congressman Cooper talked about, that 11 Democrats as well as 7 Republicans have signed on to in the House, and that I hope will have serious consideration here. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I wish to join Senator Alexander in discussing this overtime rule. As he mentioned multiple times, Senator Collins and I dropped a companion bill here in the Senate that was passed in the House that delays the overtime rule's implementation by 6 months. As he also mentioned, I am most certainly a cosponsor of his bill as well. That is another approach, and, quite frankly, we are all looking for different approaches to be able to accomplish something that needs to be done and needs to be done immediately; that is, to address a regulation which has been put in place that can have serious, I believe, unintended consequences but most certainly serious consequences across our economy. That is not an accusation that this administration wants to be able to damage the economy, wants to be able to damage small businesses, or wants to be able to damage universities and nonprofits. But I believe absolutely that is what is occurring. I am concerned, though, that the administration seems to have been deaf to the message that has come up over and over again from many of us in the Congress to be able to highlight that these are serious issues. Have you evaluated them? The Small Business Administration even has real concerns that the data they presented to the Department of Labor was not used, and the advocate for small businesses within the Department of Labor is challenging the Department of Labor to say: Why didn't you use the data that we provided to be able to evaluate this? There are a lot of questions about how the regulation itself was promulgated or what the end goal is, but let me tell you what the real consequences are on the ground. I will give a couple of hypothetical situations, and then I will go into some practical ones. Right now, a single mom with a couple of kids at home is able to telecommute into work a couple of days from her particular job as maybe a sales marketing manager. She can be in the office for 3 days, telecommute a couple of days, save child care costs, and this gives her some flexibility. Under this rule, those same places would not typically allow someone to telecommute because they have to see exactly the hours that someone is working. So she would have to physically be present in the office every day so the work hours could be tracked, removing that flexibility and causing her increased child care costs and actually moving her to more of a situation where she is in a more structured environment, less suitable for her kids. I will give another thought on this. What if we reach into a situation that many of us face as many of the millennials now leaving college are going into the workforce, well-trained, well-equipped, wanting to get an assistant manager's position or wanting to be able to work into a salaried position. It will be much more difficult for those individuals coming out of college now to land a salaried position because, overall, companies around the country that are hiring don't want to hire salaried positions anymore; they want to be able to hire hourly people. So it will be tougher for the generation coming out of college right now to be able to land in those early management positions. Is that a hypothetical situation? No. I would say it is already occurring. It [[Page S6271]] is already happening around the country. When I was home in August, traveling around the State, this overtime regulation was the No. 1 question that came up when I talked to any business owner, any business person, any manager. The first thing they raised was the coming overtime rule, both in its complexity and in trying to figure out how to be able to actually implement this into the cost of their business. The conversations were already occurring with employees where they were moving someone from a salaried position to an hourly position, and their employees hated it because they liked working to a spot where they were in a salaried position. During the August time period, I had a conversation with a youth pastor at a church. That youth pastor said they had left a conversation with their pastor just a couple of days before in which their pastor said: You are going to have to start documenting your hours--each hour that you are actually working with kids, even your time at home that you are preparing a Bible study to actually teach the kids--because we can't afford for you to go over 40 hours. This is someone who feels a calling to be able to work with students, and literally their pastor has to tell them: I know you want to help. You can't help more than 40 hours. Most youth pastors don't go into youth ministry because they anticipate getting wealthy in it. They go into it because of a sense of calling and passion to be able to help students. This regulation is telling that person: Turn down your passion to work with the next generation. You are limited in what you can actually do, and, if you choose to volunteer beyond that, you put your employer, that church, at risk. The Osage Nation--their HR folks, William Scott Johnson, said this: I'm an HR professional at the Osage Nation and am concerned about the impact that changes to the overtime regulations will have on my organization and employees. NAFOA has heard from tribal governments who are concerned the use of a single national salary threshold would adversely affect already limited revenues, especially for tribes in rural areas. From the YWCA battered women's shelter: I'm a human resource (HR) committee member at the YWCA Battered Women's Shelter and am concerned about the impact that changes to the overtime regulations will have on this nonprofit organization and employees. All employees make less than $50,000 except top management. The impact of this new legislation could be catastrophic for payroll as employees will have to be moved from exempt to non-exempt status simply due to the salary base being proposed. The Counseling & Recovery Services of Tulsa, Oklahoma, wrote me: I am the executive human resource (HR) professional at Counseling & Recovery Services of Oklahoma, a nonprofit community mental health center, and am concerned about the impact that changes to the overtime regulations will have on my organization and employees. As a nonprofit, our agency is clinical staffing heavy; thus, about 80% of our workforce . . . will be impacted. The costs to meet the proposed regulations are expected to be in the 100s of thousands [of dollars] and will have a devastating impact to the community mental health industry overall. I received a note from a small business owner in Edmond, right in my hometown. They said: The proposed changes will require us to make significant changes [in the way we do business]. If the proposed salary threshold moves forward, we will be forced to change all our employees to hourly, which will result in the elimination of our bonus program. Our salaried managers make a significant amount of their income based on performance bonuses. Calculating bonuses for employees that have potential overtime is extremely complicated, labor intensive and opens up a huge liability risk if miscalculations occur. One of the universities in my State wrote me and said about this rule: Essentially, it would turn millions of dollars of professional, salaried jobs into hourly positions overnight, resulting in limited flexibility for workers and increased costs for colleges, universities, other nonprofits and public-sector employers that operate on very tight budgets as we attempt to keep the cost of education as low as possible for constituents. We do not disagree that overtime rules need to be updated to ensure the law remains relevant for today's workforce. But we're deeply concerned about the unintended consequences of a massive increase in such a narrow implementation window which will impose serious hardships on our students, employees and institutions. Last week, I met with leadership of the Department of Labor in a hearing. We discussed this exact issue. I talked about nonprofits and what a unique dynamic they really are. Nonprofits actually raise money based on their low administrative costs. They can tell donors: The money that you give will get directly to the individuals who need it most because our administrative overhead is low. This overtime regulation will increase their administrative overhead and will make it harder for them to raise money. When I raised that issue to the Department of Labor, the officials of the Department of Labor told me: We understand that, so we met with the leadership of some of the nonprofit foundations around the country and told them that they should donate more to be able to cover the increased costs. That has to be one of the most out-of-touch statements I have ever heard from someone in the Federal Government. In shock, my response was to say: Do you know how many hundreds of thousands of nonprofits are in the country? You met with a few foundations and told those foundations that they should donate more to be able to cover, when almost every church and almost every small nonprofit around the country that deals with mental health, that deals with domestic violence shelters are not tapping into big, massive foundations. They are individuals within communities that donate, and they anticipate their donations are going to help those of greatest need. The people who work in those nonprofits are most often volunteers, but the very few numbers of individuals within the nonprofits who are paid salaries make a meager salary because they choose to--because they have a passion for the work of helping in domestic shelters or helping at a church or helping reach out to people who are in poverty or helping with a clothing shelter or a food pantry. Now you are forcing those organizations to dramatically increase salaries, which will dramatically decrease services to those in greatest need across our country. I am astounded that the administration believes they can talk to a few people in a few foundations and just tell them: Donate more, and that will fix this. There aren't more donors to just donate more. There are real needs in a lot of communities around the country. Small business owners that I have spoken to of late all tell me about the complexity of this. It is not just a matter of every employee. There is a tremendous number of exemptions as they work through the process. They want more time, and they don't like the cost increase. They don't like what this is doing to their relationships within their businesses, and they do not like telling salaried employees: I'm sorry, you're going to have to move to hourly. All of this headache was created by an administration that knew all of this in advance. The letters that I read earlier--those letters that were written to me I presented to the Department of Labor a year ago. The Secretary of Labor assured me they would take those things into account. We have seen the final rule. I can assure you, they were not taken into account. As tuition goes up in universities, this administration needs to stop complaining about the high cost of tuition in higher education because this overtime rule will directly increase the cost of tuition in every university in the country. On the day the final rule was proposed, the first text message I received about it was from a university president who texted me and said: Don't blame me next year when tuition goes up. There is no way I can stop it now. I responded back to him: Don't blame me for this overtime rule. This is not one we put in statute. This is one the administration created. All of us want to see workers protected. All of us want to see things happen well in the United States. But the way this rule was implemented, the short period of time in the implementation, the size of the salary increase, and the few exemptions that are put into place have created an incredibly toxic effect for business across the country, whether it is a large business, medium business, small business, university, nonprofit--and I haven't even mentioned local government, which will be forced to raise taxes to be able to cover the cost of this. All of them [[Page S6272]] are dramatically affected, and all of them are affected in a short period of time. This is why Senator Collins and I proposed a bill that lines up with what the House has already passed to say: Delay this 6 months. Most businesses are just trying to figure out what in the world they do with this and how they handle the implementation. Delay it for 6 months. I would say there is a tremendous amount we have to deal with on top of just the delay, but at a minimum let's delay it. There is no reason it has to go into effect right now, and it directly harms our economy in the days ahead. These are serious issues. I hope the administration will take them seriously and understand the effect on the coming economy. I am very well aware that this administration will be out of office when most of the economic effects will be felt. But the economic effects will most certainly be felt by this economy, and the long-term effects for those individuals graduating from college right now, trying to land their first job in management, will be even tougher based on this one rule. There is no reason to do that to the next generation of leaders. There is no reason to raise tuition in every college. There is no reason to do this rule right now. I would challenge it to be readdressed and, at a minimum, to be delayed for 6 months. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I join my colleagues to call for action to prevent the version of the overtime rule that the U.S. Department of Labor finalized this past May from going into effect on December 1. I want to commend Chairman Alexander, Senator Scott, and Senator Lankford for their leadership in this area. Federal regulations can impose unexpected and costly requirements on small businesses, educational institutions, and nonprofit organizations. The new U.S. Department of Labor rule on overtime pay is a prime example that could harm the very workers it intends to help, cause small businesses to curb hiring, and force universities and colleges to either raise tuition or cut programs. The new rule will double the annual salary threshold from $23,660 to $47,476 for mandatory overtime, effective December 1. While it is time for a reasonable update in the threshold, doubling the threshold overnight and with so little time for employers to prepare will have negative consequences. I have spoken with small businesses, educational institutions, and nonprofit organizations across Maine, and it is clear that this huge and sudden increase in the threshold is far too much and too fast. Rather than producing bigger paychecks, this new rule is likely to produce reduced hours, benefits, and flexibility for Maine workers. Many small employers in Maine have told me that they do not have the margins to pay overtime to salaried employees earning up to $47,476. Some will have to shift their employees to hourly positions. Formerly salaried employees used to flexibility in their work schedules will have to track closely each hour they work each week, instead of being able to leave work to pick up a child at school without worrying about the impact on their paycheck. The new rule is also a problem for those seasonal businesses in Maine that make an effort to keep their employees on the payroll all year round. In the summer and fall, these employees often work for more than 40 hours a week, but in the winter and spring, they usually work far fewer than 40 hours a week. The current system allows them to have a constant, consistent year-round salary that they can count on. The new overtime rule would upend that and result in many workers being moved from salaried to hourly positions or even being let go during winter months. This will make it harder for workers to make ends meet and harder for employers to retain high-quality employees. Although the regulation is touted as a means of boosting employees' pay, a study commissioned by the National Retail Federation found that most employees would see no change in net pay. Instead, many employees would see their hours reduced to avoid overtime, while others would see their base wages, benefits, or bonus pay decreased in order the offset the added payroll expense. Moreover, the National Federation of Independent Business, a leading voice for small business, has noted that the new overtime rule would particularly hurt small businesses in rural areas. The Maine Department of Labor believes that the rule would have a disproportionate economic effect on Maine businesses, where salaries and the cost of living are not as high as in other regions of the country. For instance, the cost of living in Bangor is roughly 37 percent lower than in Washington, DC. While $47,476 might seem like a reasonable threshold for an employee living in a high-cost area like Washington, DC, it is the equivalent of a salary of more than $74,000 in Bangor. Businesses are not alone in their concern. Nonprofit organizations are also struggling with the impact on their workers and those whom they serve. The executive director for Habitat for Humanity in greater Portland states that the ``new overtime rules will so drastically change our current compensation obligations that we may no longer be able to give our workers the benefits, schedules and other incentives that drew them to us in the first place.'' And he notes that ``services to those in need will be reduced and organizational funding will decline as resources are spent on overhead instead of programs.'' Indeed, nonprofit organizations would be among the hardest hit by this rule. Cutbacks in essential services are predicted by the Salvation Army, youth services providers, home health care services, and blood centers throughout the country. In addition, higher-education groups nationwide are urging the Department of Labor to take a more measured approach. When the final rule was published last spring, Molly Corbett Broad, the president of the American Council on Education, noted that ``requiring such a dramatic and costly change to be implemented so quickly will leave many colleges with no choice but to respond to this regulation with a combination of tuition increases, service reductions, and, possibly, layoffs.'' She went on to note that those harmed by the new rule will include ``a wide array of non-faculty employees--from athletics coaches and trainers to admissions recruiters and student affairs officers--whose work is not well suited to hourly wage status and who will face diminished workplace autonomy and fewer opportunities for flexible work arrangements and career development.'' This is not a theoretical concern. The University of Maine system would face an estimated $14 million increase in annual operating costs if it restructured employees' pay to maintain the exempt status of these workers. To avoid changes in its salary structure that could force tuition increases or threaten university services, Maine's University System is conducting an arduous and costly position realignment that could still result in an increase in annual labor costs. The overtime threshold has not been increased in a number of years and should be raised, but doubling virtually overnight and with so little time for employers to prepare will be extremely costly and damaging to small businesses, universities, nonprofit organizations, and so many other segments of our Nation's economy and our society. That is why I am a cosponsor of the resolution of disapproval of this rule introduced by Chairman Alexander and Senator Scott's Protecting Workplace Advancement and Opportunity Act, which would ensure a balanced approach to updating Federal overtime rules by requiring that any new regulation on overtime consider the impact on small business and nonprofits, differences in geographical regions, and impacts on lower-wage industries, startups, and workers. Today I am joining Chairman Alexander in introducing legislation that would phase in a more reasonable increase to the overtime threshold over five years. I am also cosponsoring another bill introduced today by Senator Lankford that would delay the effective date of the new rule by 6 months, from December 1, 2016, to June 1, 2017, to allow more time for Congress to work on this issue. The flurry of bills on this topic is indicative of just how much concern there is about the potential harm this rule could inflict on the very workers it intends to help, on small businesses, [[Page S6273]] on students, on nonprofits, and on countless others. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in rejecting this onerous and ill-advised rule. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6268-S6273] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIIONS By Mr. DAINES: S. 3460.

A bill to provide incremental increases to the salary threshold for exemptions for executive, administrative, professional, outside sales, and computer employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, and for other purposes; read the first time. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, Senate offices have been hearing about something called the overtime rule on a daily basis. We are hearing about it from colleges, universities, Boy Scout troops, church camps, other nonprofits, employers, and employees who don't like to be suddenly considered employees who punch a timecard. Today, I would like to talk about action that Congress can take to change the effect of the overtime rule the administration issued that will go into effect in December unless we do something. The Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Lankford, and the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, introduced legislation that would delay for 6 months the implementation of the rule. I cosponsored that legislation and I fully support it. Yesterday, the House of Representatives passed a bill with that same language which would delay for 6 months the implementation of the rule. That would be my preferred solution. Today I am introducing another piece of legislation that addresses the problems with the overtime rule that I hope will gather more bipartisan support. A similar bill was introduced in the House by Democrat Representative Kurt Schrader of Oregon and is cosponsored by 10 Democrats and 7 Republicans. My hope is that when we come back in November, Senators on both sides of the aisle will have heard from their Boy Scout troops, from their colleges and universities, from their restaurants, and from their employees, who say: Wait a minute, this overtime rule makes no sense the way it is being implemented. Do something in November to change its negative effect on our country. I am introducing a bill today with the cosponsorship of Senator Collins of Maine, Senator Lankford of Oklahoma, Senator Scott of South Carolina, and Senator Flake of Arizona that will protect America's nonprofits, churches, colleges, and communities from the effect of the administration's overtime rule that will go into effect on December 1 unless we act. When we talk about employers that will be affected by overtime, we are talking about Operation Smile, which is a charity that funds cleft palate operations for children. Operation Smile says this rule may cost them at least 3,000 surgeries a year. The effect of this rule may mean 3,000 children won't have surgeries each year for cleft palates because of the cost of this regulation. We are talking about the Great Smoky Mountain Council of Boy Scouts. That is my home Boy Scout council where I grew up and where I live. They are telling me the new rule will result in about $100,000 in annual costs because during certain seasons employees staff weekend camping trips, which mean longer hours. That is what you do in Boy Scouts, Mr. President--you go on camping trips. And they are not 8-hour trips most of the time. If you are going to start saying they have to pay overtime to Scout masters and others you are going to have fewer boys and girls having a chance for Scouting. Senator Isakson of Georgia spoke on the floor about a phone call he received from the pastor at Johnson Ferry Baptist Church in Marietta, one of the largest Baptist churches in Georgia. That church provides daycare, early childhood development, and sports activities at Vacation Bible School, a 24/7 program for underprivileged kids in the Atlanta area. Under the overtime rule that goes into effect in December, a camp counselor for their Vacation Bible School will have to be paid overtime for many hours of the day when they are with the children, even if they are sleeping. So this rule could price the Johnson Ferry Baptist Church out of the business of providing Bible school church camp for underprivileged children. So there will be fewer cleft palate operations, fewer Scouting opportunities, and fewer church camp opportunities for underprivileged children. Here's what I mean by the overtime rule: Hourly workers in this country are usually paid overtime, but salaried workers generally don't earn overtime unless they are making below a threshold set by the Labor Department and required by the Fair Labor Standards Act. Today that threshold is a little over $23,000. This new rule issued by the Obama administration just 4 months ago raises the threshold from just over $23,000 to over $47,000 all at once on December 1. In other words, in 3 months it will double. This is a 100-percent increase and on December 1, employers will have had only about 6 months to prepare for this, reclassify employees, put time clock systems in place, adjust workers' schedules, and find new revenue to pay for all of this. It has thrown small businesses and colleges into a panic in the State of Tennessee. One poll released this month found that 49 percent of business owners were not aware of the rule that goes into effect in 3 months. The legislation I am introducing today would stretch out over 5 years the administration's increase in the salary threshold for overtime pay. I have not met many people who don't believe the threshold ought to go up. I have not met many people who think that it ought to be doubled in 6 months and automatically increased every 3 years, or that it should jump so high and all at once. On December 1, under the legislation I am introducing, it would still increase significantly--from $23,660 to $35,984. This is about a 50- percent increase. This bill would modify a rule that many believe goes too high and too fast and will result in employers, nonprofits, colleges, and others cutting workers' hours and limiting their workplace benefits and flexibility, as well as costing students more in tuition. If there is one subject I hear about on the Senate floor, it is Senators from both sides of the aisle saying college costs are too high. Yet the independent colleges and the public colleges of Tennessee have written me and they have detailed how the cost of this rule will have the effect of raising tuition by hundreds of dollars per student. So how can you go around complaining about college tuition increases on the one hand and on the other hand issue a rule that raises college tuition by hundreds of dollars in thousands of schools? [[Page S6270]] My bill will do four things: No. 1, it will modify the rule so that it is phased in over 5 years rather than all at once on December 1. Most people I talk to think it ought to go up, just as I have said, but they do not think it ought to go up all at once. There is no need for that, so phase it in over 5 years. No. 2, make a significant increase on December 1, but then prohibit an increase in 2017 to give employers and employees an opportunity to adjust while our independent government watchdog--the Government Accountability Office, the GAO--studies the impact of the rule on American workers after the first year of implementation. So what I have said is that on December 1, the threshold goes up 50 percent, and then for 1 year it doesn't go up at all while the GAO studies the impact of that increase on colleges, church camps, businesses, workers, and others. No. 3, it would clarify that the administration does not have the authority to automatically increase the overtime threshold, which is currently set to occur automatically every 3 years, starting in 2020. No. 4, it would require a study of the rule's impact after the first year of implementation. If the study finds the impact is negative, the bill will exempt certain employers from future increases--nonprofits, including churches, colleges, and universities; State and local governments; many Medicaid and Medicare eligible facilities, such as nursing homes or facilities serving individuals with disabilities. These are employers who can't just raise prices. They are dependent on tax dollars or on charitable donations. And if they are in trouble because of this rule, our communities will lose critical services-- surgeries for cleft palates, Scouting opportunities, church camps for underprivileged kids, and others. This is not a partisan proposal. My bill is very similar to a bill introduced by House Democrat Kurt Schrader of Oregon and cosponsored by 10 Democrats and 7 Republicans. So my hope is that our Democratic colleagues will take a look at this bill and say that this is a reasonable, bipartisan proposal to apply more common sense to the overtime rule when it comes to the employees, employers, and nonprofits that serve our country. Without these bills, on December 1, the salary threshold for overtime pay will more than double, from just over $23,000 to over $47,000. Representative Kurt Schrader, a Democrat, when he introduced his bill, said the following: Since the Department of Labor's immediate phase-in date was announced, we've heard from business owners and their employees who are worried about implementing this increase overnight. Without sufficient time to plan for the increase, cuts and demotions will become inevitable, and workers will actually end up making less than they made before. Democratic Representative Schrader has 10 Democrats as cosponsors, including Congressman Jim Cooper from my State of Tennessee, who said: I am hearing from lots of Middle Tennesseans who are worried about how this new rule will affect them. The overtime rule hadn't been adjusted in years and needed updating. But it's good to make commonsense changes and add flexibility so the rule works for all businesses and workers can actually have a chance to get ahead. We don't want to see lost hours or shifts in job responsibility. I congratulate Senator Collins of Maine and Senator Lankford of Oklahoma for the legislation they introduced to delay the overtime rule's effect for 6 months. I support that bill, and I am glad the House of Representatives last night passed that bill, but I am also introducing this alternative for those in the body--especially my Democratic friends--who might not be willing to delay the implementation of the overtime rule, who believe it should go up, who believe it should go up as high as the President has proposed but not as fast as the President has proposed, and who believe the rule has created a problem for nonprofits, such as the Boy Scouts, or surgeries for cleft palates or church camps. I hope they will seriously consider the proposal I have made today, along with Senators Collins, Lankford, Scott, and Flake. Over the next 5 weeks between now and the election, we will all be home. We will have a chance to see our Boy Scout leaders. We will have a chance to see our doctors and visit our churches. We can go by our colleges and ask how much this is going to raise the tuition at Maryville College, the University of Tennessee, the University of Wyoming, or wherever we may be. And if the fact is that most Americans feel that to impose this salary threshold on December 1 is too high and too fast, there will be two alternatives when we come back. One is to delay the rule for 6 months, and the other is to raise the threshold just as high as the President proposed but do it over 5 years. Take half of the increase in the first year, no increase the second year, and exempt nonprofits, state and local governments, and many Medicare- and Medicaid-eligible facilities if they are negatively affected. This is similar to the commonsense proposal that Congressman Cooper talked about, that 11 Democrats as well as 7 Republicans have signed on to in the House, and that I hope will have serious consideration here. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I wish to join Senator Alexander in discussing this overtime rule. As he mentioned multiple times, Senator Collins and I dropped a companion bill here in the Senate that was passed in the House that delays the overtime rule's implementation by 6 months. As he also mentioned, I am most certainly a cosponsor of his bill as well. That is another approach, and, quite frankly, we are all looking for different approaches to be able to accomplish something that needs to be done and needs to be done immediately; that is, to address a regulation which has been put in place that can have serious, I believe, unintended consequences but most certainly serious consequences across our economy. That is not an accusation that this administration wants to be able to damage the economy, wants to be able to damage small businesses, or wants to be able to damage universities and nonprofits. But I believe absolutely that is what is occurring. I am concerned, though, that the administration seems to have been deaf to the message that has come up over and over again from many of us in the Congress to be able to highlight that these are serious issues. Have you evaluated them? The Small Business Administration even has real concerns that the data they presented to the Department of Labor was not used, and the advocate for small businesses within the Department of Labor is challenging the Department of Labor to say: Why didn't you use the data that we provided to be able to evaluate this? There are a lot of questions about how the regulation itself was promulgated or what the end goal is, but let me tell you what the real consequences are on the ground. I will give a couple of hypothetical situations, and then I will go into some practical ones. Right now, a single mom with a couple of kids at home is able to telecommute into work a couple of days from her particular job as maybe a sales marketing manager. She can be in the office for 3 days, telecommute a couple of days, save child care costs, and this gives her some flexibility. Under this rule, those same places would not typically allow someone to telecommute because they have to see exactly the hours that someone is working. So she would have to physically be present in the office every day so the work hours could be tracked, removing that flexibility and causing her increased child care costs and actually moving her to more of a situation where she is in a more structured environment, less suitable for her kids. I will give another thought on this. What if we reach into a situation that many of us face as many of the millennials now leaving college are going into the workforce, well-trained, well-equipped, wanting to get an assistant manager's position or wanting to be able to work into a salaried position. It will be much more difficult for those individuals coming out of college now to land a salaried position because, overall, companies around the country that are hiring don't want to hire salaried positions anymore; they want to be able to hire hourly people. So it will be tougher for the generation coming out of college right now to be able to land in those early management positions. Is that a hypothetical situation? No. I would say it is already occurring. It [[Page S6271]] is already happening around the country. When I was home in August, traveling around the State, this overtime regulation was the No. 1 question that came up when I talked to any business owner, any business person, any manager. The first thing they raised was the coming overtime rule, both in its complexity and in trying to figure out how to be able to actually implement this into the cost of their business. The conversations were already occurring with employees where they were moving someone from a salaried position to an hourly position, and their employees hated it because they liked working to a spot where they were in a salaried position. During the August time period, I had a conversation with a youth pastor at a church. That youth pastor said they had left a conversation with their pastor just a couple of days before in which their pastor said: You are going to have to start documenting your hours--each hour that you are actually working with kids, even your time at home that you are preparing a Bible study to actually teach the kids--because we can't afford for you to go over 40 hours. This is someone who feels a calling to be able to work with students, and literally their pastor has to tell them: I know you want to help. You can't help more than 40 hours. Most youth pastors don't go into youth ministry because they anticipate getting wealthy in it. They go into it because of a sense of calling and passion to be able to help students. This regulation is telling that person: Turn down your passion to work with the next generation. You are limited in what you can actually do, and, if you choose to volunteer beyond that, you put your employer, that church, at risk. The Osage Nation--their HR folks, William Scott Johnson, said this: I'm an HR professional at the Osage Nation and am concerned about the impact that changes to the overtime regulations will have on my organization and employees. NAFOA has heard from tribal governments who are concerned the use of a single national salary threshold would adversely affect already limited revenues, especially for tribes in rural areas. From the YWCA battered women's shelter: I'm a human resource (HR) committee member at the YWCA Battered Women's Shelter and am concerned about the impact that changes to the overtime regulations will have on this nonprofit organization and employees. All employees make less than $50,000 except top management. The impact of this new legislation could be catastrophic for payroll as employees will have to be moved from exempt to non-exempt status simply due to the salary base being proposed. The Counseling & Recovery Services of Tulsa, Oklahoma, wrote me: I am the executive human resource (HR) professional at Counseling & Recovery Services of Oklahoma, a nonprofit community mental health center, and am concerned about the impact that changes to the overtime regulations will have on my organization and employees. As a nonprofit, our agency is clinical staffing heavy; thus, about 80% of our workforce . . . will be impacted. The costs to meet the proposed regulations are expected to be in the 100s of thousands [of dollars] and will have a devastating impact to the community mental health industry overall. I received a note from a small business owner in Edmond, right in my hometown. They said: The proposed changes will require us to make significant changes [in the way we do business]. If the proposed salary threshold moves forward, we will be forced to change all our employees to hourly, which will result in the elimination of our bonus program. Our salaried managers make a significant amount of their income based on performance bonuses. Calculating bonuses for employees that have potential overtime is extremely complicated, labor intensive and opens up a huge liability risk if miscalculations occur. One of the universities in my State wrote me and said about this rule: Essentially, it would turn millions of dollars of professional, salaried jobs into hourly positions overnight, resulting in limited flexibility for workers and increased costs for colleges, universities, other nonprofits and public-sector employers that operate on very tight budgets as we attempt to keep the cost of education as low as possible for constituents. We do not disagree that overtime rules need to be updated to ensure the law remains relevant for today's workforce. But we're deeply concerned about the unintended consequences of a massive increase in such a narrow implementation window which will impose serious hardships on our students, employees and institutions. Last week, I met with leadership of the Department of Labor in a hearing. We discussed this exact issue. I talked about nonprofits and what a unique dynamic they really are. Nonprofits actually raise money based on their low administrative costs. They can tell donors: The money that you give will get directly to the individuals who need it most because our administrative overhead is low. This overtime regulation will increase their administrative overhead and will make it harder for them to raise money. When I raised that issue to the Department of Labor, the officials of the Department of Labor told me: We understand that, so we met with the leadership of some of the nonprofit foundations around the country and told them that they should donate more to be able to cover the increased costs. That has to be one of the most out-of-touch statements I have ever heard from someone in the Federal Government. In shock, my response was to say: Do you know how many hundreds of thousands of nonprofits are in the country? You met with a few foundations and told those foundations that they should donate more to be able to cover, when almost every church and almost every small nonprofit around the country that deals with mental health, that deals with domestic violence shelters are not tapping into big, massive foundations. They are individuals within communities that donate, and they anticipate their donations are going to help those of greatest need. The people who work in those nonprofits are most often volunteers, but the very few numbers of individuals within the nonprofits who are paid salaries make a meager salary because they choose to--because they have a passion for the work of helping in domestic shelters or helping at a church or helping reach out to people who are in poverty or helping with a clothing shelter or a food pantry. Now you are forcing those organizations to dramatically increase salaries, which will dramatically decrease services to those in greatest need across our country. I am astounded that the administration believes they can talk to a few people in a few foundations and just tell them: Donate more, and that will fix this. There aren't more donors to just donate more. There are real needs in a lot of communities around the country. Small business owners that I have spoken to of late all tell me about the complexity of this. It is not just a matter of every employee. There is a tremendous number of exemptions as they work through the process. They want more time, and they don't like the cost increase. They don't like what this is doing to their relationships within their businesses, and they do not like telling salaried employees: I'm sorry, you're going to have to move to hourly. All of this headache was created by an administration that knew all of this in advance. The letters that I read earlier--those letters that were written to me I presented to the Department of Labor a year ago. The Secretary of Labor assured me they would take those things into account. We have seen the final rule. I can assure you, they were not taken into account. As tuition goes up in universities, this administration needs to stop complaining about the high cost of tuition in higher education because this overtime rule will directly increase the cost of tuition in every university in the country. On the day the final rule was proposed, the first text message I received about it was from a university president who texted me and said: Don't blame me next year when tuition goes up. There is no way I can stop it now. I responded back to him: Don't blame me for this overtime rule. This is not one we put in statute. This is one the administration created. All of us want to see workers protected. All of us want to see things happen well in the United States. But the way this rule was implemented, the short period of time in the implementation, the size of the salary increase, and the few exemptions that are put into place have created an incredibly toxic effect for business across the country, whether it is a large business, medium business, small business, university, nonprofit--and I haven't even mentioned local government, which will be forced to raise taxes to be able to cover the cost of this. All of them [[Page S6272]] are dramatically affected, and all of them are affected in a short period of time. This is why Senator Collins and I proposed a bill that lines up with what the House has already passed to say: Delay this 6 months. Most businesses are just trying to figure out what in the world they do with this and how they handle the implementation. Delay it for 6 months. I would say there is a tremendous amount we have to deal with on top of just the delay, but at a minimum let's delay it. There is no reason it has to go into effect right now, and it directly harms our economy in the days ahead. These are serious issues. I hope the administration will take them seriously and understand the effect on the coming economy. I am very well aware that this administration will be out of office when most of the economic effects will be felt. But the economic effects will most certainly be felt by this economy, and the long-term effects for those individuals graduating from college right now, trying to land their first job in management, will be even tougher based on this one rule. There is no reason to do that to the next generation of leaders. There is no reason to raise tuition in every college. There is no reason to do this rule right now. I would challenge it to be readdressed and, at a minimum, to be delayed for 6 months. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I join my colleagues to call for action to prevent the version of the overtime rule that the U.S. Department of Labor finalized this past May from going into effect on December 1. I want to commend Chairman Alexander, Senator Scott, and Senator Lankford for their leadership in this area. Federal regulations can impose unexpected and costly requirements on small businesses, educational institutions, and nonprofit organizations. The new U.S. Department of Labor rule on overtime pay is a prime example that could harm the very workers it intends to help, cause small businesses to curb hiring, and force universities and colleges to either raise tuition or cut programs. The new rule will double the annual salary threshold from $23,660 to $47,476 for mandatory overtime, effective December 1. While it is time for a reasonable update in the threshold, doubling the threshold overnight and with so little time for employers to prepare will have negative consequences. I have spoken with small businesses, educational institutions, and nonprofit organizations across Maine, and it is clear that this huge and sudden increase in the threshold is far too much and too fast. Rather than producing bigger paychecks, this new rule is likely to produce reduced hours, benefits, and flexibility for Maine workers. Many small employers in Maine have told me that they do not have the margins to pay overtime to salaried employees earning up to $47,476. Some will have to shift their employees to hourly positions. Formerly salaried employees used to flexibility in their work schedules will have to track closely each hour they work each week, instead of being able to leave work to pick up a child at school without worrying about the impact on their paycheck. The new rule is also a problem for those seasonal businesses in Maine that make an effort to keep their employees on the payroll all year round. In the summer and fall, these employees often work for more than 40 hours a week, but in the winter and spring, they usually work far fewer than 40 hours a week. The current system allows them to have a constant, consistent year-round salary that they can count on. The new overtime rule would upend that and result in many workers being moved from salaried to hourly positions or even being let go during winter months. This will make it harder for workers to make ends meet and harder for employers to retain high-quality employees. Although the regulation is touted as a means of boosting employees' pay, a study commissioned by the National Retail Federation found that most employees would see no change in net pay. Instead, many employees would see their hours reduced to avoid overtime, while others would see their base wages, benefits, or bonus pay decreased in order the offset the added payroll expense. Moreover, the National Federation of Independent Business, a leading voice for small business, has noted that the new overtime rule would particularly hurt small businesses in rural areas. The Maine Department of Labor believes that the rule would have a disproportionate economic effect on Maine businesses, where salaries and the cost of living are not as high as in other regions of the country. For instance, the cost of living in Bangor is roughly 37 percent lower than in Washington, DC. While $47,476 might seem like a reasonable threshold for an employee living in a high-cost area like Washington, DC, it is the equivalent of a salary of more than $74,000 in Bangor. Businesses are not alone in their concern. Nonprofit organizations are also struggling with the impact on their workers and those whom they serve. The executive director for Habitat for Humanity in greater Portland states that the ``new overtime rules will so drastically change our current compensation obligations that we may no longer be able to give our workers the benefits, schedules and other incentives that drew them to us in the first place.'' And he notes that ``services to those in need will be reduced and organizational funding will decline as resources are spent on overhead instead of programs.'' Indeed, nonprofit organizations would be among the hardest hit by this rule. Cutbacks in essential services are predicted by the Salvation Army, youth services providers, home health care services, and blood centers throughout the country. In addition, higher-education groups nationwide are urging the Department of Labor to take a more measured approach. When the final rule was published last spring, Molly Corbett Broad, the president of the American Council on Education, noted that ``requiring such a dramatic and costly change to be implemented so quickly will leave many colleges with no choice but to respond to this regulation with a combination of tuition increases, service reductions, and, possibly, layoffs.'' She went on to note that those harmed by the new rule will include ``a wide array of non-faculty employees--from athletics coaches and trainers to admissions recruiters and student affairs officers--whose work is not well suited to hourly wage status and who will face diminished workplace autonomy and fewer opportunities for flexible work arrangements and career development.'' This is not a theoretical concern. The University of Maine system would face an estimated $14 million increase in annual operating costs if it restructured employees' pay to maintain the exempt status of these workers. To avoid changes in its salary structure that could force tuition increases or threaten university services, Maine's University System is conducting an arduous and costly position realignment that could still result in an increase in annual labor costs. The overtime threshold has not been increased in a number of years and should be raised, but doubling virtually overnight and with so little time for employers to prepare will be extremely costly and damaging to small businesses, universities, nonprofit organizations, and so many other segments of our Nation's economy and our society. That is why I am a cosponsor of the resolution of disapproval of this rule introduced by Chairman Alexander and Senator Scott's Protecting Workplace Advancement and Opportunity Act, which would ensure a balanced approach to updating Federal overtime rules by requiring that any new regulation on overtime consider the impact on small business and nonprofits, differences in geographical regions, and impacts on lower-wage industries, startups, and workers. Today I am joining Chairman Alexander in introducing legislation that would phase in a more reasonable increase to the overtime threshold over five years. I am also cosponsoring another bill introduced today by Senator Lankford that would delay the effective date of the new rule by 6 months, from December 1, 2016, to June 1, 2017, to allow more time for Congress to work on this issue. The flurry of bills on this topic is indicative of just how much concern there is about the potential harm this rule could inflict on the very workers it intends to help, on small businesses, [[Page S6273]] on students, on nonprofits, and on countless others. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in rejecting this onerous and ill-advised rule. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6268-S6273] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIIONS By Mr. DAINES: S. 3460.

A bill to provide incremental increases to the salary threshold for exemptions for executive, administrative, professional, outside sales, and computer employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, and for other purposes; read the first time. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, Senate offices have been hearing about something called the overtime rule on a daily basis. We are hearing about it from colleges, universities, Boy Scout troops, church camps, other nonprofits, employers, and employees who don't like to be suddenly considered employees who punch a timecard. Today, I would like to talk about action that Congress can take to change the effect of the overtime rule the administration issued that will go into effect in December unless we do something. The Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Lankford, and the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, introduced legislation that would delay for 6 months the implementation of the rule. I cosponsored that legislation and I fully support it. Yesterday, the House of Representatives passed a bill with that same language which would delay for 6 months the implementation of the rule. That would be my preferred solution. Today I am introducing another piece of legislation that addresses the problems with the overtime rule that I hope will gather more bipartisan support. A similar bill was introduced in the House by Democrat Representative Kurt Schrader of Oregon and is cosponsored by 10 Democrats and 7 Republicans. My hope is that when we come back in November, Senators on both sides of the aisle will have heard from their Boy Scout troops, from their colleges and universities, from their restaurants, and from their employees, who say: Wait a minute, this overtime rule makes no sense the way it is being implemented. Do something in November to change its negative effect on our country. I am introducing a bill today with the cosponsorship of Senator Collins of Maine, Senator Lankford of Oklahoma, Senator Scott of South Carolina, and Senator Flake of Arizona that will protect America's nonprofits, churches, colleges, and communities from the effect of the administration's overtime rule that will go into effect on December 1 unless we act. When we talk about employers that will be affected by overtime, we are talking about Operation Smile, which is a charity that funds cleft palate operations for children. Operation Smile says this rule may cost them at least 3,000 surgeries a year. The effect of this rule may mean 3,000 children won't have surgeries each year for cleft palates because of the cost of this regulation. We are talking about the Great Smoky Mountain Council of Boy Scouts. That is my home Boy Scout council where I grew up and where I live. They are telling me the new rule will result in about $100,000 in annual costs because during certain seasons employees staff weekend camping trips, which mean longer hours. That is what you do in Boy Scouts, Mr. President--you go on camping trips. And they are not 8-hour trips most of the time. If you are going to start saying they have to pay overtime to Scout masters and others you are going to have fewer boys and girls having a chance for Scouting. Senator Isakson of Georgia spoke on the floor about a phone call he received from the pastor at Johnson Ferry Baptist Church in Marietta, one of the largest Baptist churches in Georgia. That church provides daycare, early childhood development, and sports activities at Vacation Bible School, a 24/7 program for underprivileged kids in the Atlanta area. Under the overtime rule that goes into effect in December, a camp counselor for their Vacation Bible School will have to be paid overtime for many hours of the day when they are with the children, even if they are sleeping. So this rule could price the Johnson Ferry Baptist Church out of the business of providing Bible school church camp for underprivileged children. So there will be fewer cleft palate operations, fewer Scouting opportunities, and fewer church camp opportunities for underprivileged children. Here's what I mean by the overtime rule: Hourly workers in this country are usually paid overtime, but salaried workers generally don't earn overtime unless they are making below a threshold set by the Labor Department and required by the Fair Labor Standards Act. Today that threshold is a little over $23,000. This new rule issued by the Obama administration just 4 months ago raises the threshold from just over $23,000 to over $47,000 all at once on December 1. In other words, in 3 months it will double. This is a 100-percent increase and on December 1, employers will have had only about 6 months to prepare for this, reclassify employees, put time clock systems in place, adjust workers' schedules, and find new revenue to pay for all of this. It has thrown small businesses and colleges into a panic in the State of Tennessee. One poll released this month found that 49 percent of business owners were not aware of the rule that goes into effect in 3 months. The legislation I am introducing today would stretch out over 5 years the administration's increase in the salary threshold for overtime pay. I have not met many people who don't believe the threshold ought to go up. I have not met many people who think that it ought to be doubled in 6 months and automatically increased every 3 years, or that it should jump so high and all at once. On December 1, under the legislation I am introducing, it would still increase significantly--from $23,660 to $35,984. This is about a 50- percent increase. This bill would modify a rule that many believe goes too high and too fast and will result in employers, nonprofits, colleges, and others cutting workers' hours and limiting their workplace benefits and flexibility, as well as costing students more in tuition. If there is one subject I hear about on the Senate floor, it is Senators from both sides of the aisle saying college costs are too high. Yet the independent colleges and the public colleges of Tennessee have written me and they have detailed how the cost of this rule will have the effect of raising tuition by hundreds of dollars per student. So how can you go around complaining about college tuition increases on the one hand and on the other hand issue a rule that raises college tuition by hundreds of dollars in thousands of schools? [[Page S6270]] My bill will do four things: No. 1, it will modify the rule so that it is phased in over 5 years rather than all at once on December 1. Most people I talk to think it ought to go up, just as I have said, but they do not think it ought to go up all at once. There is no need for that, so phase it in over 5 years. No. 2, make a significant increase on December 1, but then prohibit an increase in 2017 to give employers and employees an opportunity to adjust while our independent government watchdog--the Government Accountability Office, the GAO--studies the impact of the rule on American workers after the first year of implementation. So what I have said is that on December 1, the threshold goes up 50 percent, and then for 1 year it doesn't go up at all while the GAO studies the impact of that increase on colleges, church camps, businesses, workers, and others. No. 3, it would clarify that the administration does not have the authority to automatically increase the overtime threshold, which is currently set to occur automatically every 3 years, starting in 2020. No. 4, it would require a study of the rule's impact after the first year of implementation. If the study finds the impact is negative, the bill will exempt certain employers from future increases--nonprofits, including churches, colleges, and universities; State and local governments; many Medicaid and Medicare eligible facilities, such as nursing homes or facilities serving individuals with disabilities. These are employers who can't just raise prices. They are dependent on tax dollars or on charitable donations. And if they are in trouble because of this rule, our communities will lose critical services-- surgeries for cleft palates, Scouting opportunities, church camps for underprivileged kids, and others. This is not a partisan proposal. My bill is very similar to a bill introduced by House Democrat Kurt Schrader of Oregon and cosponsored by 10 Democrats and 7 Republicans. So my hope is that our Democratic colleagues will take a look at this bill and say that this is a reasonable, bipartisan proposal to apply more common sense to the overtime rule when it comes to the employees, employers, and nonprofits that serve our country. Without these bills, on December 1, the salary threshold for overtime pay will more than double, from just over $23,000 to over $47,000. Representative Kurt Schrader, a Democrat, when he introduced his bill, said the following: Since the Department of Labor's immediate phase-in date was announced, we've heard from business owners and their employees who are worried about implementing this increase overnight. Without sufficient time to plan for the increase, cuts and demotions will become inevitable, and workers will actually end up making less than they made before. Democratic Representative Schrader has 10 Democrats as cosponsors, including Congressman Jim Cooper from my State of Tennessee, who said: I am hearing from lots of Middle Tennesseans who are worried about how this new rule will affect them. The overtime rule hadn't been adjusted in years and needed updating. But it's good to make commonsense changes and add flexibility so the rule works for all businesses and workers can actually have a chance to get ahead. We don't want to see lost hours or shifts in job responsibility. I congratulate Senator Collins of Maine and Senator Lankford of Oklahoma for the legislation they introduced to delay the overtime rule's effect for 6 months. I support that bill, and I am glad the House of Representatives last night passed that bill, but I am also introducing this alternative for those in the body--especially my Democratic friends--who might not be willing to delay the implementation of the overtime rule, who believe it should go up, who believe it should go up as high as the President has proposed but not as fast as the President has proposed, and who believe the rule has created a problem for nonprofits, such as the Boy Scouts, or surgeries for cleft palates or church camps. I hope they will seriously consider the proposal I have made today, along with Senators Collins, Lankford, Scott, and Flake. Over the next 5 weeks between now and the election, we will all be home. We will have a chance to see our Boy Scout leaders. We will have a chance to see our doctors and visit our churches. We can go by our colleges and ask how much this is going to raise the tuition at Maryville College, the University of Tennessee, the University of Wyoming, or wherever we may be. And if the fact is that most Americans feel that to impose this salary threshold on December 1 is too high and too fast, there will be two alternatives when we come back. One is to delay the rule for 6 months, and the other is to raise the threshold just as high as the President proposed but do it over 5 years. Take half of the increase in the first year, no increase the second year, and exempt nonprofits, state and local governments, and many Medicare- and Medicaid-eligible facilities if they are negatively affected. This is similar to the commonsense proposal that Congressman Cooper talked about, that 11 Democrats as well as 7 Republicans have signed on to in the House, and that I hope will have serious consideration here. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I wish to join Senator Alexander in discussing this overtime rule. As he mentioned multiple times, Senator Collins and I dropped a companion bill here in the Senate that was passed in the House that delays the overtime rule's implementation by 6 months. As he also mentioned, I am most certainly a cosponsor of his bill as well. That is another approach, and, quite frankly, we are all looking for different approaches to be able to accomplish something that needs to be done and needs to be done immediately; that is, to address a regulation which has been put in place that can have serious, I believe, unintended consequences but most certainly serious consequences across our economy. That is not an accusation that this administration wants to be able to damage the economy, wants to be able to damage small businesses, or wants to be able to damage universities and nonprofits. But I believe absolutely that is what is occurring. I am concerned, though, that the administration seems to have been deaf to the message that has come up over and over again from many of us in the Congress to be able to highlight that these are serious issues. Have you evaluated them? The Small Business Administration even has real concerns that the data they presented to the Department of Labor was not used, and the advocate for small businesses within the Department of Labor is challenging the Department of Labor to say: Why didn't you use the data that we provided to be able to evaluate this? There are a lot of questions about how the regulation itself was promulgated or what the end goal is, but let me tell you what the real consequences are on the ground. I will give a couple of hypothetical situations, and then I will go into some practical ones. Right now, a single mom with a couple of kids at home is able to telecommute into work a couple of days from her particular job as maybe a sales marketing manager. She can be in the office for 3 days, telecommute a couple of days, save child care costs, and this gives her some flexibility. Under this rule, those same places would not typically allow someone to telecommute because they have to see exactly the hours that someone is working. So she would have to physically be present in the office every day so the work hours could be tracked, removing that flexibility and causing her increased child care costs and actually moving her to more of a situation where she is in a more structured environment, less suitable for her kids. I will give another thought on this. What if we reach into a situation that many of us face as many of the millennials now leaving college are going into the workforce, well-trained, well-equipped, wanting to get an assistant manager's position or wanting to be able to work into a salaried position. It will be much more difficult for those individuals coming out of college now to land a salaried position because, overall, companies around the country that are hiring don't want to hire salaried positions anymore; they want to be able to hire hourly people. So it will be tougher for the generation coming out of college right now to be able to land in those early management positions. Is that a hypothetical situation? No. I would say it is already occurring. It [[Page S6271]] is already happening around the country. When I was home in August, traveling around the State, this overtime regulation was the No. 1 question that came up when I talked to any business owner, any business person, any manager. The first thing they raised was the coming overtime rule, both in its complexity and in trying to figure out how to be able to actually implement this into the cost of their business. The conversations were already occurring with employees where they were moving someone from a salaried position to an hourly position, and their employees hated it because they liked working to a spot where they were in a salaried position. During the August time period, I had a conversation with a youth pastor at a church. That youth pastor said they had left a conversation with their pastor just a couple of days before in which their pastor said: You are going to have to start documenting your hours--each hour that you are actually working with kids, even your time at home that you are preparing a Bible study to actually teach the kids--because we can't afford for you to go over 40 hours. This is someone who feels a calling to be able to work with students, and literally their pastor has to tell them: I know you want to help. You can't help more than 40 hours. Most youth pastors don't go into youth ministry because they anticipate getting wealthy in it. They go into it because of a sense of calling and passion to be able to help students. This regulation is telling that person: Turn down your passion to work with the next generation. You are limited in what you can actually do, and, if you choose to volunteer beyond that, you put your employer, that church, at risk. The Osage Nation--their HR folks, William Scott Johnson, said this: I'm an HR professional at the Osage Nation and am concerned about the impact that changes to the overtime regulations will have on my organization and employees. NAFOA has heard from tribal governments who are concerned the use of a single national salary threshold would adversely affect already limited revenues, especially for tribes in rural areas. From the YWCA battered women's shelter: I'm a human resource (HR) committee member at the YWCA Battered Women's Shelter and am concerned about the impact that changes to the overtime regulations will have on this nonprofit organization and employees. All employees make less than $50,000 except top management. The impact of this new legislation could be catastrophic for payroll as employees will have to be moved from exempt to non-exempt status simply due to the salary base being proposed. The Counseling & Recovery Services of Tulsa, Oklahoma, wrote me: I am the executive human resource (HR) professional at Counseling & Recovery Services of Oklahoma, a nonprofit community mental health center, and am concerned about the impact that changes to the overtime regulations will have on my organization and employees. As a nonprofit, our agency is clinical staffing heavy; thus, about 80% of our workforce . . . will be impacted. The costs to meet the proposed regulations are expected to be in the 100s of thousands [of dollars] and will have a devastating impact to the community mental health industry overall. I received a note from a small business owner in Edmond, right in my hometown. They said: The proposed changes will require us to make significant changes [in the way we do business]. If the proposed salary threshold moves forward, we will be forced to change all our employees to hourly, which will result in the elimination of our bonus program. Our salaried managers make a significant amount of their income based on performance bonuses. Calculating bonuses for employees that have potential overtime is extremely complicated, labor intensive and opens up a huge liability risk if miscalculations occur. One of the universities in my State wrote me and said about this rule: Essentially, it would turn millions of dollars of professional, salaried jobs into hourly positions overnight, resulting in limited flexibility for workers and increased costs for colleges, universities, other nonprofits and public-sector employers that operate on very tight budgets as we attempt to keep the cost of education as low as possible for constituents. We do not disagree that overtime rules need to be updated to ensure the law remains relevant for today's workforce. But we're deeply concerned about the unintended consequences of a massive increase in such a narrow implementation window which will impose serious hardships on our students, employees and institutions. Last week, I met with leadership of the Department of Labor in a hearing. We discussed this exact issue. I talked about nonprofits and what a unique dynamic they really are. Nonprofits actually raise money based on their low administrative costs. They can tell donors: The money that you give will get directly to the individuals who need it most because our administrative overhead is low. This overtime regulation will increase their administrative overhead and will make it harder for them to raise money. When I raised that issue to the Department of Labor, the officials of the Department of Labor told me: We understand that, so we met with the leadership of some of the nonprofit foundations around the country and told them that they should donate more to be able to cover the increased costs. That has to be one of the most out-of-touch statements I have ever heard from someone in the Federal Government. In shock, my response was to say: Do you know how many hundreds of thousands of nonprofits are in the country? You met with a few foundations and told those foundations that they should donate more to be able to cover, when almost every church and almost every small nonprofit around the country that deals with mental health, that deals with domestic violence shelters are not tapping into big, massive foundations. They are individuals within communities that donate, and they anticipate their donations are going to help those of greatest need. The people who work in those nonprofits are most often volunteers, but the very few numbers of individuals within the nonprofits who are paid salaries make a meager salary because they choose to--because they have a passion for the work of helping in domestic shelters or helping at a church or helping reach out to people who are in poverty or helping with a clothing shelter or a food pantry. Now you are forcing those organizations to dramatically increase salaries, which will dramatically decrease services to those in greatest need across our country. I am astounded that the administration believes they can talk to a few people in a few foundations and just tell them: Donate more, and that will fix this. There aren't more donors to just donate more. There are real needs in a lot of communities around the country. Small business owners that I have spoken to of late all tell me about the complexity of this. It is not just a matter of every employee. There is a tremendous number of exemptions as they work through the process. They want more time, and they don't like the cost increase. They don't like what this is doing to their relationships within their businesses, and they do not like telling salaried employees: I'm sorry, you're going to have to move to hourly. All of this headache was created by an administration that knew all of this in advance. The letters that I read earlier--those letters that were written to me I presented to the Department of Labor a year ago. The Secretary of Labor assured me they would take those things into account. We have seen the final rule. I can assure you, they were not taken into account. As tuition goes up in universities, this administration needs to stop complaining about the high cost of tuition in higher education because this overtime rule will directly increase the cost of tuition in every university in the country. On the day the final rule was proposed, the first text message I received about it was from a university president who texted me and said: Don't blame me next year when tuition goes up. There is no way I can stop it now. I responded back to him: Don't blame me for this overtime rule. This is not one we put in statute. This is one the administration created. All of us want to see workers protected. All of us want to see things happen well in the United States. But the way this rule was implemented, the short period of time in the implementation, the size of the salary increase, and the few exemptions that are put into place have created an incredibly toxic effect for business across the country, whether it is a large business, medium business, small business, university, nonprofit--and I haven't even mentioned local government, which will be forced to raise taxes to be able to cover the cost of this. All of them [[Page S6272]] are dramatically affected, and all of them are affected in a short period of time. This is why Senator Collins and I proposed a bill that lines up with what the House has already passed to say: Delay this 6 months. Most businesses are just trying to figure out what in the world they do with this and how they handle the implementation. Delay it for 6 months. I would say there is a tremendous amount we have to deal with on top of just the delay, but at a minimum let's delay it. There is no reason it has to go into effect right now, and it directly harms our economy in the days ahead. These are serious issues. I hope the administration will take them seriously and understand the effect on the coming economy. I am very well aware that this administration will be out of office when most of the economic effects will be felt. But the economic effects will most certainly be felt by this economy, and the long-term effects for those individuals graduating from college right now, trying to land their first job in management, will be even tougher based on this one rule. There is no reason to do that to the next generation of leaders. There is no reason to raise tuition in every college. There is no reason to do this rule right now. I would challenge it to be readdressed and, at a minimum, to be delayed for 6 months. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I join my colleagues to call for action to prevent the version of the overtime rule that the U.S. Department of Labor finalized this past May from going into effect on December 1. I want to commend Chairman Alexander, Senator Scott, and Senator Lankford for their leadership in this area. Federal regulations can impose unexpected and costly requirements on small businesses, educational institutions, and nonprofit organizations. The new U.S. Department of Labor rule on overtime pay is a prime example that could harm the very workers it intends to help, cause small businesses to curb hiring, and force universities and colleges to either raise tuition or cut programs. The new rule will double the annual salary threshold from $23,660 to $47,476 for mandatory overtime, effective December 1. While it is time for a reasonable update in the threshold, doubling the threshold overnight and with so little time for employers to prepare will have negative consequences. I have spoken with small businesses, educational institutions, and nonprofit organizations across Maine, and it is clear that this huge and sudden increase in the threshold is far too much and too fast. Rather than producing bigger paychecks, this new rule is likely to produce reduced hours, benefits, and flexibility for Maine workers. Many small employers in Maine have told me that they do not have the margins to pay overtime to salaried employees earning up to $47,476. Some will have to shift their employees to hourly positions. Formerly salaried employees used to flexibility in their work schedules will have to track closely each hour they work each week, instead of being able to leave work to pick up a child at school without worrying about the impact on their paycheck. The new rule is also a problem for those seasonal businesses in Maine that make an effort to keep their employees on the payroll all year round. In the summer and fall, these employees often work for more than 40 hours a week, but in the winter and spring, they usually work far fewer than 40 hours a week. The current system allows them to have a constant, consistent year-round salary that they can count on. The new overtime rule would upend that and result in many workers being moved from salaried to hourly positions or even being let go during winter months. This will make it harder for workers to make ends meet and harder for employers to retain high-quality employees. Although the regulation is touted as a means of boosting employees' pay, a study commissioned by the National Retail Federation found that most employees would see no change in net pay. Instead, many employees would see their hours reduced to avoid overtime, while others would see their base wages, benefits, or bonus pay decreased in order the offset the added payroll expense. Moreover, the National Federation of Independent Business, a leading voice for small business, has noted that the new overtime rule would particularly hurt small businesses in rural areas. The Maine Department of Labor believes that the rule would have a disproportionate economic effect on Maine businesses, where salaries and the cost of living are not as high as in other regions of the country. For instance, the cost of living in Bangor is roughly 37 percent lower than in Washington, DC. While $47,476 might seem like a reasonable threshold for an employee living in a high-cost area like Washington, DC, it is the equivalent of a salary of more than $74,000 in Bangor. Businesses are not alone in their concern. Nonprofit organizations are also struggling with the impact on their workers and those whom they serve. The executive director for Habitat for Humanity in greater Portland states that the ``new overtime rules will so drastically change our current compensation obligations that we may no longer be able to give our workers the benefits, schedules and other incentives that drew them to us in the first place.'' And he notes that ``services to those in need will be reduced and organizational funding will decline as resources are spent on overhead instead of programs.'' Indeed, nonprofit organizations would be among the hardest hit by this rule. Cutbacks in essential services are predicted by the Salvation Army, youth services providers, home health care services, and blood centers throughout the country. In addition, higher-education groups nationwide are urging the Department of Labor to take a more measured approach. When the final rule was published last spring, Molly Corbett Broad, the president of the American Council on Education, noted that ``requiring such a dramatic and costly change to be implemented so quickly will leave many colleges with no choice but to respond to this regulation with a combination of tuition increases, service reductions, and, possibly, layoffs.'' She went on to note that those harmed by the new rule will include ``a wide array of non-faculty employees--from athletics coaches and trainers to admissions recruiters and student affairs officers--whose work is not well suited to hourly wage status and who will face diminished workplace autonomy and fewer opportunities for flexible work arrangements and career development.'' This is not a theoretical concern. The University of Maine system would face an estimated $14 million increase in annual operating costs if it restructured employees' pay to maintain the exempt status of these workers. To avoid changes in its salary structure that could force tuition increases or threaten university services, Maine's University System is conducting an arduous and costly position realignment that could still result in an increase in annual labor costs. The overtime threshold has not been increased in a number of years and should be raised, but doubling virtually overnight and with so little time for employers to prepare will be extremely costly and damaging to small businesses, universities, nonprofit organizations, and so many other segments of our Nation's economy and our society. That is why I am a cosponsor of the resolution of disapproval of this rule introduced by Chairman Alexander and Senator Scott's Protecting Workplace Advancement and Opportunity Act, which would ensure a balanced approach to updating Federal overtime rules by requiring that any new regulation on overtime consider the impact on small business and nonprofits, differences in geographical regions, and impacts on lower-wage industries, startups, and workers. Today I am joining Chairman Alexander in introducing legislation that would phase in a more reasonable increase to the overtime threshold over five years. I am also cosponsoring another bill introduced today by Senator Lankford that would delay the effective date of the new rule by 6 months, from December 1, 2016, to June 1, 2017, to allow more time for Congress to work on this issue. The flurry of bills on this topic is indicative of just how much concern there is about the potential harm this rule could inflict on the very workers it intends to help, on small businesses, [[Page S6273]] on students, on nonprofits, and on countless others. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in rejecting this onerous and ill-advised rule. ____________________",package_114_206.csv,35253,35253,35327,"[congressional record volume 162, number 148 (thursday, september 29, 2016)] [senate] [pages s6268-s6273] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] statements on introduced bills and joint resolutiions by mr. daines: s. 3460. a bill to amend title 54, united states code, to provide certain limitations on the designation and use of national monuments; to the committee on energy and natural resources. mr. daines. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the record.

scott, and mr. flake): s. 3464. a bill to provide incremental increases to the salary threshold for exemptions for executive, administrative, professional, outside sales, and computer employees under the fair labor standards act of 1938, and for other purposes; read the first time. mr. alexander. mr. president, senate offices have been hearing about something called the overtime rule on a daily basis. we are hearing about it from colleges, universities, boy scout troops, church camps, other nonprofits, employers, and employees who don't like to be suddenly considered employees who punch a timecard. today, i would like to talk about action that congress can take to change the effect of the overtime rule the administration issued that will go into effect in december unless we do something. the senator from oklahoma, mr. lankford, and the senator from maine, ms. collins, introduced legislation that would delay for 6 months the implementation of the rule. i cosponsored that legislation and i fully support it. yesterday, the house of representatives passed a bill with that same language which would delay for 6 months the implementation of the rule. that would be my preferred solution. today i am introducing another piece of legislation that addresses the problems with the overtime rule that i hope will gather more bipartisan support. a similar bill was introduced in the house by democrat representative kurt schrader of oregon and is cosponsored by 10 democrats and 7 republicans. my hope is that when we come back in november, senators on both sides of the aisle will have heard from their boy scout troops, from their colleges and universities, from their restaurants, and from their employees, who say: wait a minute, this overtime rule makes no sense the way it is being implemented. do something in november to change its negative effect on our country. i am introducing a bill today with the cosponsorship of senator collins of maine, senator lankford of oklahoma, senator scott of south carolina, and senator flake of arizona that will protect america's nonprofits, churches, colleges, and communities from the effect of the administration's overtime rule that will go into effect on december 1 unless we act. when we talk about employers that will be affected by overtime, we are talking about operation smile, which is a charity that funds cleft palate operations for children. operation smile says this rule may cost them at least 3,000 surgeries a year. the effect of this rule may mean 3,000 children won't have surgeries each year for cleft palates because of the cost of this regulation. we are talking about the great smoky mountain council of boy scouts. that is my home boy scout council where i grew up and where i live. they are telling me the new rule will result in about $100,000 in annual costs because during certain seasons employees staff weekend camping trips, which mean longer hours. that is what you do in boy scouts, mr. president--you go on camping trips. and they are not 8-hour trips most of the time. if you are going to start saying they have to pay overtime to scout masters and others you are going to have fewer boys and girls having a chance for scouting. senator isakson of georgia spoke on the floor about a phone call he received from the pastor at johnson ferry baptist church in marietta, one of the largest baptist churches in georgia. that church provides daycare, early childhood development, and sports activities at vacation bible school, a 24/7 program for underprivileged kids in the atlanta area. under the overtime rule that goes into effect in december, a camp counselor for their vacation bible school will have to be paid overtime for many hours of the day when they are with the children, even if they are sleeping. so this rule could price the johnson ferry baptist church out of the business of providing bible school church camp for underprivileged children. so there will be fewer cleft palate operations, fewer scouting opportunities, and fewer church camp opportunities for underprivileged children. here's what i mean by the overtime rule: hourly workers in this country are usually paid overtime, but salaried workers generally don't earn overtime unless they are making below a threshold set by the labor department and required by the fair labor standards act. today that threshold is a little over $23,000. this new rule issued by the obama administration just 4 months ago raises the threshold from just over $23,000 to over $47,000 all at once on december 1. in other words, in 3 months it will double. this is a 100-percent increase and on december 1, employers will have had only about 6 months to prepare for this, reclassify employees, put time clock systems in place, adjust workers' schedules, and find new revenue to pay for all of this. it has thrown small businesses and colleges into a panic in the state of tennessee. one poll released this month found that 49 percent of business owners were not aware of the rule that goes into effect in 3 months. the legislation i am introducing today would stretch out over 5 years the administration's increase in the salary threshold for overtime pay. i have not met many people who don't believe the threshold ought to go up. i have not met many people who think that it ought to be doubled in 6 months and automatically increased every 3 years, or that it should jump so high and all at once. on december 1, under the legislation i am introducing, it would still increase significantly--from $23,660 to $35,984. this is about a 50- percent increase. this bill would modify a rule that many believe goes too high and too fast and will result in employers, nonprofits, colleges, and others cutting workers' hours and limiting their workplace benefits and flexibility, as well as costing students more in tuition. if there is one subject i hear about on the senate floor, it is senators from both sides of the aisle saying college costs are too high. yet the independent colleges and the public colleges of tennessee have written me and they have detailed how the cost of this rule will have the effect of raising tuition by hundreds of dollars per student. so how can you go around complaining about college tuition increases on the one hand and on the other hand issue a rule that raises college tuition by hundreds of dollars in thousands of schools? [[page s6270]] my bill will do four things: no. 1, it will modify the rule so that it is phased in over 5 years rather than all at once on december 1. most people i talk to think it ought to go up, just as i have said, but they do not think it ought to go up all at once. there is no need for that, so phase it in over 5 years. no. 2, make a significant increase on december 1, but then prohibit an increase in 2017 to give employers and employees an opportunity to adjust while our independent government watchdog--the government accountability office, the gao--studies the impact of the rule on american workers after the first year of implementation. so what i have said is that on december 1, the threshold goes up 50 percent, and then for 1 year it doesn't go up at all while the gao studies the impact of that increase on colleges, church camps, businesses, workers, and others. no. 3, it would clarify that the administration does not have the authority to automatically increase the overtime threshold, which is currently set to occur automatically every 3 years, starting in 2020. no. 4, it would require a study of the rule's impact after the first year of implementation. if the study finds the impact is negative, the bill will exempt certain employers from future increases--nonprofits, including churches, colleges, and universities; state and local governments; many medicaid and medicare eligible facilities, such as nursing homes or facilities serving individuals with disabilities. these are employers who can't just raise prices. they are dependent on tax dollars or on charitable donations. and if they are in trouble because of this rule, our communities will lose critical services-- surgeries for cleft palates, scouting opportunities, church camps for underprivileged kids, and others. this is not a partisan proposal. my bill is very similar to a bill introduced by house democrat kurt schrader of oregon and cosponsored by 10 democrats and 7 republicans. so my hope is that our democratic colleagues will take a look at this bill and say that this is a reasonable, bipartisan proposal to apply more common sense to the overtime rule when it comes to the employees, employers, and nonprofits that serve our country. without these bills, on december 1, the salary threshold for overtime pay will more than double, from just over $23,000 to over $47,000. representative kurt schrader, a democrat, when he introduced his bill, said the following: since the department of labor's immediate phase-in date was announced, we've heard from business owners and their employees who are worried about implementing this increase overnight. without sufficient time to plan for the increase, cuts and demotions will become inevitable, and workers will actually end up making less than they made before. democratic representative schrader has 10 democrats as cosponsors, including congressman jim cooper from my state of tennessee, who said: i am hearing from lots of middle tennesseans who are worried about how this new rule will affect them. the overtime rule hadn't been adjusted in years and needed updating. but it's good to make commonsense changes and add flexibility so the rule works for all businesses and workers can actually have a chance to get ahead. we don't want to see lost hours or shifts in job responsibility. i congratulate senator collins of maine and senator lankford of oklahoma for the legislation they introduced to delay the overtime rule's effect for 6 months. i support that bill, and i am glad the house of representatives last night passed that bill, but i am also introducing this alternative for those in the body--especially my democratic friends--who might not be willing to delay the implementation of the overtime rule, who believe it should go up, who believe it should go up as high as the president has proposed but not as fast as the president has proposed, and who believe the rule has created a problem for nonprofits, such as the boy scouts, or surgeries for cleft palates or church camps. i hope they will seriously consider the proposal i have made today, along with senators collins, lankford, scott, and flake. over the next 5 weeks between now and the election, we will all be home. we will have a chance to see our boy scout leaders. we will have a chance to see our doctors and visit our churches. we can go by our colleges and ask how much this is going to raise the tuition at maryville college, the university of tennessee, the university of wyoming, or wherever we may be. and if the fact is that most americans feel that to impose this salary threshold on december 1 is too high and too fast, there will be two alternatives when we come back. one is to delay the rule for 6 months, and the other is to raise the threshold just as high as the president proposed but do it over 5 years. take half of the increase in the first year, no increase the second year, and exempt nonprofits, state and local governments, and many medicare- and medicaid-eligible facilities if they are negatively affected. this is similar to the commonsense proposal that congressman cooper talked about, that 11 democrats as well as 7 republicans have signed on to in the house, and that i hope will have serious consideration here. the presiding officer. the senator from oklahoma. mr. lankford. mr. president, i wish to join senator alexander in discussing this overtime rule. as he mentioned multiple times, senator collins and i dropped a companion bill here in the senate that was passed in the house that delays the overtime rule's implementation by 6 months. as he also mentioned, i am most certainly a cosponsor of his bill as well. that is another approach, and, quite frankly, we are all looking for different approaches to be able to accomplish something that needs to be done and needs to be done immediately; that is, to address a regulation which has been put in place that can have serious, i believe, unintended consequences but most certainly serious consequences across our economy. that is not an accusation that this administration wants to be able to damage the economy, wants to be able to damage small businesses, or wants to be able to damage universities and nonprofits. but i believe absolutely that is what is occurring. i am concerned, though, that the administration seems to have been deaf to the message that has come up over and over again from many of us in the congress to be able to highlight that these are serious issues. have you evaluated them? the small business administration even has real concerns that the data they presented to the department of labor was not used, and the advocate for small businesses within the department of labor is challenging the department of labor to say: why didn't you use the data that we provided to be able to evaluate this? there are a lot of questions about how the regulation itself was promulgated or what the end goal is, but let me tell you what the real consequences are on the ground. i will give a couple of hypothetical situations, and then i will go into some practical ones. right now, a single mom with a couple of kids at home is able to telecommute into work a couple of days from her particular job as maybe a sales marketing manager. she can be in the office for 3 days, telecommute a couple of days, save child care costs, and this gives her some flexibility. under this rule, those same places would not typically allow someone to telecommute because they have to see exactly the hours that someone is working. so she would have to physically be present in the office every day so the work hours could be tracked, removing that flexibility and causing her increased child care costs and actually moving her to more of a situation where she is in a more structured environment, less suitable for her kids. i will give another thought on this. what if we reach into a situation that many of us face as many of the millennials now leaving college are going into the workforce, well-trained, well-equipped, wanting to get an assistant manager's position or wanting to be able to work into a salaried position. it will be much more difficult for those individuals coming out of college now to land a salaried position because, overall, companies around the country that are hiring don't want to hire salaried positions anymore; they want to be able to hire hourly people. so it will be tougher for the generation coming out of college right now to be able to land in those early management positions. is that a hypothetical situation? no. i would say it is already occurring. it [[page s6271]] is already happening around the country. when i was home in august, traveling around the state, this overtime regulation was the no. 1 question that came up when i talked to any business owner, any business person, any manager. the first thing they raised was the coming overtime rule, both in its complexity and in trying to figure out how to be able to actually implement this into the cost of their business. the conversations were already occurring with employees where they were moving someone from a salaried position to an hourly position, and their employees hated it because they liked working to a spot where they were in a salaried position. during the august time period, i had a conversation with a youth pastor at a church. that youth pastor said they had left a conversation with their pastor just a couple of days before in which their pastor said: you are going to have to start documenting your hours--each hour that you are actually working with kids, even your time at home that you are preparing a bible study to actually teach the kids--because we can't afford for you to go over 40 hours. this is someone who feels a calling to be able to work with students, and literally their pastor has to tell them: i know you want to help. you can't help more than 40 hours. most youth pastors don't go into youth ministry because they anticipate getting wealthy in it. they go into it because of a sense of calling and passion to be able to help students. this regulation is telling that person: turn down your passion to work with the next generation. you are limited in what you can actually do, and, if you choose to volunteer beyond that, you put your employer, that church, at risk. the osage nation--their hr folks, william scott johnson, said this: i'm an hr professional at the osage nation and am concerned about the impact that changes to the overtime regulations will have on my organization and employees. nafoa has heard from tribal governments who are concerned the use of a single national salary threshold would adversely affect already limited revenues, especially for tribes in rural areas. from the ywca battered women's shelter: i'm a human resource (hr) committee member at the ywca battered women's shelter and am concerned about the impact that changes to the overtime regulations will have on this nonprofit organization and employees. all employees make less than $50,000 except top management. the impact of this new legislation could be catastrophic for payroll as employees will have to be moved from exempt to non-exempt status simply due to the salary base being proposed. the counseling & recovery services of tulsa, oklahoma, wrote me: i am the executive human resource (hr) professional at counseling & recovery services of oklahoma, a nonprofit community mental health center, and am concerned about the impact that changes to the overtime regulations will have on my organization and employees. as a nonprofit, our agency is clinical staffing heavy; thus, about 80% of our workforce . . . will be impacted. the costs to meet the proposed regulations are expected to be in the 100s of thousands [of dollars] and will have a devastating impact to the community mental health industry overall. i received a note from a small business owner in edmond, right in my hometown. they said: the proposed changes will require us to make significant changes [in the way we do business]. if the proposed salary threshold moves forward, we will be forced to change all our employees to hourly, which will result in the elimination of our bonus program. our salaried managers make a significant amount of their income based on performance bonuses. calculating bonuses for employees that have potential overtime is extremely complicated, labor intensive and opens up a huge liability risk if miscalculations occur. one of the universities in my state wrote me and said about this rule: essentially, it would turn millions of dollars of professional, salaried jobs into hourly positions overnight, resulting in limited flexibility for workers and increased costs for colleges, universities, other nonprofits and public-sector employers that operate on very tight budgets as we attempt to keep the cost of education as low as possible for constituents. we do not disagree that overtime rules need to be updated to ensure the law remains relevant for today's workforce. but we're deeply concerned about the unintended consequences of a massive increase in such a narrow implementation window which will impose serious hardships on our students, employees and institutions. last week, i met with leadership of the department of labor in a hearing. we discussed this exact issue. i talked about nonprofits and what a unique dynamic they really are. nonprofits actually raise money based on their low administrative costs. they can tell donors: the money that you give will get directly to the individuals who need it most because our administrative overhead is low. this overtime regulation will increase their administrative overhead and will make it harder for them to raise money. when i raised that issue to the department of labor, the officials of the department of labor told me: we understand that, so we met with the leadership of some of the nonprofit foundations around the country and told them that they should donate more to be able to cover the increased costs. that has to be one of the most out-of-touch statements i have ever heard from someone in the federal government. in shock, my response was to say: do you know how many hundreds of thousands of nonprofits are in the country? you met with a few foundations and told those foundations that they should donate more to be able to cover, when almost every church and almost every small nonprofit around the country that deals with mental health, that deals with domestic violence shelters are not tapping into big, massive foundations. they are individuals within communities that donate, and they anticipate their donations are going to help those of greatest need. the people who work in those nonprofits are most often volunteers, but the very few numbers of individuals within the nonprofits who are paid salaries make a meager salary because they choose to--because they have a passion for the work of helping in domestic shelters or helping at a church or helping reach out to people who are in poverty or helping with a clothing shelter or a food pantry. now you are forcing those organizations to dramatically increase salaries, which will dramatically decrease services to those in greatest need across our country. i am astounded that the administration believes they can talk to a few people in a few foundations and just tell them: donate more, and that will fix this. there aren't more donors to just donate more. there are real needs in a lot of communities around the country. small business owners that i have spoken to of late all tell me about the complexity of this. it is not just a matter of every employee. there is a tremendous number of exemptions as they work through the process. they want more time, and they don't like the cost increase. they don't like what this is doing to their relationships within their businesses, and they do not like telling salaried employees: i'm sorry, you're going to have to move to hourly. all of this headache was created by an administration that knew all of this in advance. the letters that i read earlier--those letters that were written to me i presented to the department of labor a year ago. the secretary of labor assured me they would take those things into account. we have seen the final rule. i can assure you, they were not taken into account. as tuition goes up in universities, this administration needs to stop complaining about the high cost of tuition in higher education because this overtime rule will directly increase the cost of tuition in every university in the country. on the day the final rule was proposed, the first text message i received about it was from a university president who texted me and said: don't blame me next year when tuition goes up. there is no way i can stop it now. i responded back to him: don't blame me for this overtime rule. this is not one we put in statute. this is one the administration created. all of us want to see workers protected. all of us want to see things happen well in the united states. but the way this rule was implemented, the short period of time in the implementation, the size of the salary increase, and the few exemptions that are put into place have created an incredibly toxic effect for business across the country, whether it is a large business, medium business, small business, university, nonprofit--and i haven't even mentioned local government, which will be forced to raise taxes to be able to cover the cost of this. all of them [[page s6272]] are dramatically affected, and all of them are affected in a short period of time. this is why senator collins and i proposed a bill that lines up with what the house has already passed to say: delay this 6 months. most businesses are just trying to figure out what in the world they do with this and how they handle the implementation. delay it for 6 months. i would say there is a tremendous amount we have to deal with on top of just the delay, but at a minimum let's delay it. there is no reason it has to go into effect right now, and it directly harms our economy in the days ahead. these are serious issues. i hope the administration will take them seriously and understand the effect on the coming economy. i am very well aware that this administration will be out of office when most of the economic effects will be felt. but the economic effects will most certainly be felt by this economy, and the long-term effects for those individuals graduating from college right now, trying to land their first job in management, will be even tougher based on this one rule. there is no reason to do that to the next generation of leaders. there is no reason to raise tuition in every college. there is no reason to do this rule right now. i would challenge it to be readdressed and, at a minimum, to be delayed for 6 months. ms. collins. mr. president, i join my colleagues to call for action to prevent the version of the overtime rule that the u.s. department of labor finalized this past may from going into effect on december 1. i want to commend chairman alexander, senator scott, and senator lankford for their leadership in this area. federal regulations can impose unexpected and costly requirements on small businesses, educational institutions, and nonprofit organizations. the new u.s. department of labor rule on overtime pay is a prime example that could harm the very workers it intends to help, cause small businesses to curb hiring, and force universities and colleges to either raise tuition or cut programs. the new rule will double the annual salary threshold from $23,660 to $47,476 for mandatory overtime, effective december 1. while it is time for a reasonable update in the threshold, doubling the threshold overnight and with so little time for employers to prepare will have negative consequences. i have spoken with small businesses, educational institutions, and nonprofit organizations across maine, and it is clear that this huge and sudden increase in the threshold is far too much and too fast. rather than producing bigger paychecks, this new rule is likely to produce reduced hours, benefits, and flexibility for maine workers. many small employers in maine have told me that they do not have the margins to pay overtime to salaried employees earning up to $47,476. some will have to shift their employees to hourly positions. formerly salaried employees used to flexibility in their work schedules will have to track closely each hour they work each week, instead of being able to leave work to pick up a child at school without worrying about the impact on their paycheck. the new rule is also a problem for those seasonal businesses in maine that make an effort to keep their employees on the payroll all year round. in the summer and fall, these employees often work for more than 40 hours a week, but in the winter and spring, they usually work far fewer than 40 hours a week. the current system allows them to have a constant, consistent year-round salary that they can count on. the new overtime rule would upend that and result in many workers being moved from salaried to hourly positions or even being let go during winter months. this will make it harder for workers to make ends meet and harder for employers to retain high-quality employees. although the regulation is touted as a means of boosting employees' pay, a study commissioned by the national retail federation found that most employees would see no change in net pay. instead, many employees would see their hours reduced to avoid overtime, while others would see their base wages, benefits, or bonus pay decreased in order the offset the added payroll expense. moreover, the national federation of independent business, a leading voice for small business, has noted that the new overtime rule would particularly hurt small businesses in rural areas. the maine department of labor believes that the rule would have a disproportionate economic effect on maine businesses, where salaries and the cost of living are not as high as in other regions of the country. for instance, the cost of living in bangor is roughly 37 percent lower than in washington, dc. while $47,476 might seem like a reasonable threshold for an employee living in a high-cost area like washington, dc, it is the equivalent of a salary of more than $74,000 in bangor. businesses are not alone in their concern. nonprofit organizations are also struggling with the impact on their workers and those whom they serve. the executive director for habitat for humanity in greater portland states that the ``new overtime rules will so drastically change our current compensation obligations that we may no longer be able to give our workers the benefits, schedules and other incentives that drew them to us in the first place.'' and he notes that ``services to those in need will be reduced and organizational funding will decline as resources are spent on overhead instead of programs.'' indeed, nonprofit organizations would be among the hardest hit by this rule. cutbacks in essential services are predicted by the salvation army, youth services providers, home health care services, and blood centers throughout the country. in addition, higher-education groups nationwide are urging the department of labor to take a more measured approach. when the final rule was published last spring, molly corbett broad, the president of the american council on education, noted that ``requiring such a dramatic and costly change to be implemented so quickly will leave many colleges with no choice but to respond to this regulation with a combination of tuition increases, service reductions, and, possibly, layoffs.'' she went on to note that those harmed by the new rule will include ``a wide array of non-faculty employees--from athletics coaches and trainers to admissions recruiters and student affairs officers--whose work is not well suited to hourly wage status and who will face diminished workplace autonomy and fewer opportunities for flexible work arrangements and career development.'' this is not a theoretical concern. the university of maine system would face an estimated $14 million increase in annual operating costs if it restructured employees' pay to maintain the exempt status of these workers. to avoid changes in its salary structure that could force tuition increases or threaten university services, maine's university system is conducting an arduous and costly position realignment that could still result in an increase in annual labor costs. the overtime threshold has not been increased in a number of years and should be raised, but doubling virtually overnight and with so little time for employers to prepare will be extremely costly and damaging to small businesses, universities, nonprofit organizations, and so many other segments of our nation's economy and our society. that is why i am a cosponsor of the resolution of disapproval of this rule introduced by chairman alexander and senator scott's protecting workplace advancement and opportunity act, which would ensure a balanced approach to updating federal overtime rules by requiring that any new regulation on overtime consider the impact on small business and nonprofits, differences in geographical regions, and impacts on lower-wage industries, startups, and workers. today i am joining chairman alexander in introducing legislation that would phase in a more reasonable increase to the overtime threshold over five years. i am also cosponsoring another bill introduced today by senator lankford that would delay the effective date of the new rule by 6 months, from december 1, 2016, to june 1, 2017, to allow more time for congress to work on this issue. the flurry of bills on this topic is indicative of just how much concern there is about the potential harm this rule could inflict on the very workers it intends to help, on small businesses, [[page s6273]] on students, on nonprofits, and on countless others. i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in rejecting this onerous and ill-advised rule.

Res. 590 Whereas on October 16, 1916, Margaret Sanger, her sister Ethel Byrne, and their activist friend Fania Mindell opened the first birth control health clinic in the United States in Brooklyn, New York, a groundbreaking and revolutionary act for women at that time; Whereas their clinic was founded on the idea that women should have the information and care they need to live strong, healthy lives and fulfill their dreams; Whereas Margaret Sanger in 1922 incorporated the American Birth Control League and in 1923 opened the first legal birth control center in the United States, the Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau, two organizations that would later merge to become Planned Parenthood Federation of America; Whereas leading up to 1916, the two most common causes of death for women of childbearing age in the United States were tuberculosis and complications from pregnancy and childbirth; Whereas over the past 100 years, gains in access to birth control, safe and legal abortion, and other reproductive health services have improved and transformed the lives of women, men, and young people in the United States and around the world; Whereas for the past century, Planned Parenthood has helped lead massive changes in women's health and civil rights and has empowered millions of women, men, and young people worldwide to make informed health decisions, transforming the way they live, love, learn, and work; Whereas Planned Parenthood has been at the forefront of fights for social change, including when the executive director of Planned Parenthood League of Connecticut challenged a law preventing the distribution of birth control, leading to the landmark 1964 Supreme Court ruling in Griswold v. Connecticut, 379 U.S. 926, which finally allowed married women across the country to have legal access to birth control; Whereas Planned Parenthood health care providers and staff have played important roles in increasing access to safe and legal abortion, and have successfully advocated for measures that increase access to birth control, including the Affordable Care Act requirement that private insurance plans provide coverage for birth control with no-out-of-pocket costs; Whereas many leaders, including those in the domestic and global reproductive health, rights, and justice communities, have worked alongside Planned Parenthood in accomplishing these achievements; Whereas breakthroughs in women's health care, such as the legalization and expanded availability of birth control, have been named one of the biggest economic advancements for women in the past 100 years; Whereas changes in women's access to reproductive health care have led to cultural shifts: in the United States, women are now nearly half the workforce, the sole or primary breadwinners in 40 percent of homes, and more than half of the college students; Whereas from the single Brooklyn clinic in 1916, Planned Parenthood has grown to approximately 650 clinics across the United States, with partners in a dozen countries in Africa and Latin America; Whereas today Planned Parenthood proudly provides high- quality, affordable health care, with 90 percent of services provided being preventive health care for women, men, and young people; Whereas Planned Parenthood is the largest provider of sex education in the United States; Whereas an estimated 1 in 5 women in the United States have been to a Planned Parenthood clinic for care at some point in their lives, and, for many people, a Planned Parenthood clinic may be the only place they can turn to for health care; Whereas in a single year, Planned Parenthood clinics provide sexual and reproductive health care, education, information, and outreach to 2,500,000 women, men, and adolescents in the United States and almost 2,000,000 women, men, and young people globally through its global programs and partnerships, and over 72,000,000 people visit Planned Parenthood's website; Whereas in the past 10 years, Planned Parenthood has nearly doubled services for male patients and expanded services for LGBTQ communities; and Whereas Planned Parenthood's commitment to offer care and resources has grown over the past century and is stronger than ever as it enters into its second century: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate-- (1) supports the wide-ranging preventive services that Planned Parenthood Federation of America doctors, nurses, and staff provide every day to patients across the United States; (2) recognizes that Planned Parenthood is a safety-net provider that reaches medically underserved people who are critically in need of compassionate care; (3) declares that Planned Parenthood should not be defunded, attacked, or discriminated against for their role as a vital women's health care provider across the country; and (4) affirms that Planned Parenthood remains an essential thread in the fabric of society, and it will be key in the next century to assisting millions of women, men, and young people in accessing the health care they need and deserve, no matter who they are or where they live. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, Congress has just passed a funding measure that will prevent a shutdown at the end of this week. As headlines across the country noted as the debate over this bill played out, it was delayed partly due to partisan attacks against women's health and one provider in particular--Planned Parenthood--that were shoehorned into the debate once again. Colleagues, this year Planned Parenthood turns 100 years old. You cannot look at the last 100 years and deny that monumental progress has been made with respect to women's health and rights--thanks to strong allies like Planned Parenthood. But that progress is what some members of this body want to roll back. When the first Planned Parenthood opened in 1916, it was illegal for women to get information about how to prevent a pregnancy. It is not surprising that at the time, one of the leading causes of death for women in the United States was complications from pregnancy and childbirth. From the get-go, Planned Parenthood said that women in America have a fundamental right to information about their reproductive health and access to care. It was about the right of all women to a healthy life and the pursuit of happiness. In 1965, Planned Parenthood Connecticut fought and won the Supreme Court decision that made birth control legal for married women. In 2010, Planned Parenthood was at the front lines of the battle, along with a lot of us here in the Senate, to ensure that birth control would be covered under the Affordable Care Act. Today, an estimated one in five women in America has been to a Planned Parenthood clinic for care at some point in her life. Eight out of ten Planned Parenthood patients live in or near poverty. As tough as it is for them to make ends meet, Planned Parenthood is a place they can turn to for important medical care from a provider they trust. Planned Parenthood at 100 years old has racked up some impressive points on the scoreboard. Each year Planned Parenthood provides educational programs to 1.5 million people. Planned Parenthood has doubled the number of health services it provides to men and has led the way in expanding access to health care for LGBT Americans. It has more than 650 health centers across the country and served two and a half million women and men last year. In my home State of Oregon, more than 70,000 Oregonians are served by 11 Planned Parenthood centers. I know firsthand from visiting with Planned Parenthood officials throughout Oregon in Portland, in Lane County, in central Oregon, how important these centers are to the health care of Oregonians. Planned Parenthood is at the heart of the revolution in women's health care over the last 100 years. It is the first place millions of American women turn to for health care--women from Portland, OR, to Portland, ME. Here are some of the services Planned Parenthood provides: birth control and counseling; pregnancy tests; prenatal services; HIV tests; safe, legal abortion services; breast cancer screenings; HPV vaccinations; cervical cancer screenings and prevention; ovarian cancer screenings; PAP tests; [[Page S6274]] exams for sexually transmitted diseases; treatment for urinary tract infections; basic physical exams; adoption referrals; family practice services; and nutrition programs. Despite all these critical services Planned Parenthood provides, every day, legislators attack Planned Parenthood. The fact is this crusade against Planned Parenthood is a crusade against the fundamental and constitutionally-protected right of women to make their own decisions about their bodies. Time and time again on the Senate floor and in debates with the other side, my Democratic colleagues and I have had to beat back the attempts to defund Planned Parenthood. Here is my bottom line colleagues. This country has made 100 years of progress on women's health, and it's not going to move backward. I urge my colleagues to honor the commitment to women's health and rights that Planned Parenthood has shown in the last 100 years by working in a bipartisan way to improve access to women's health care, instead of limiting it. Let us allow more women and men to access the health care they need and deserve, no matter who they are or where they live. Let us work to uphold the fundamental right of all women to make their own reproductive choices and access quality health care. Let us continue funding for Planned Parenthood and end these partisan attacks against this bedrock American health provider. Today, I am joined by 17 of my colleagues in introducing a resolution to formally recognize Planned Parenthood's immense contributions to progress for women's health and quality of life in America. It is time to end the unfounded attacks against Planned Parenthood and allow it to continue to provide critical health services for the next 100 years. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6273-S6274] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS ______ SENATE RESOLUTION 590--COMMEMORATING 100 YEARS OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES PROVIDED BY PLANNED PARENTHOOD Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Brown, Mrs. Shaheen, Ms. Hirono, Mr. Franken, Mr. Bennet, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Booker, Mr. Schumer, Ms. Warren, Mr. Durbin, Ms. Cantwell, and Mrs. Feinstein) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions: S.

Connecticut, 379 U.S. 926, which finally allowed married women across the country to have legal access to birth control; Whereas Planned Parenthood health care providers and staff have played important roles in increasing access to safe and legal abortion, and have successfully advocated for measures that increase access to birth control, including the Affordable Care Act requirement that private insurance plans provide coverage for birth control with no-out-of-pocket costs; Whereas many leaders, including those in the domestic and global reproductive health, rights, and justice communities, have worked alongside Planned Parenthood in accomplishing these achievements; Whereas breakthroughs in women's health care, such as the legalization and expanded availability of birth control, have been named one of the biggest economic advancements for women in the past 100 years; Whereas changes in women's access to reproductive health care have led to cultural shifts: in the United States, women are now nearly half the workforce, the sole or primary breadwinners in 40 percent of homes, and more than half of the college students; Whereas from the single Brooklyn clinic in 1916, Planned Parenthood has grown to approximately 650 clinics across the United States, with partners in a dozen countries in Africa and Latin America; Whereas today Planned Parenthood proudly provides high- quality, affordable health care, with 90 percent of services provided being preventive health care for women, men, and young people; Whereas Planned Parenthood is the largest provider of sex education in the United States; Whereas an estimated 1 in 5 women in the United States have been to a Planned Parenthood clinic for care at some point in their lives, and, for many people, a Planned Parenthood clinic may be the only place they can turn to for health care; Whereas in a single year, Planned Parenthood clinics provide sexual and reproductive health care, education, information, and outreach to 2,500,000 women, men, and adolescents in the United States and almost 2,000,000 women, men, and young people globally through its global programs and partnerships, and over 72,000,000 people visit Planned Parenthood's website; Whereas in the past 10 years, Planned Parenthood has nearly doubled services for male patients and expanded services for LGBTQ communities; and Whereas Planned Parenthood's commitment to offer care and resources has grown over the past century and is stronger than ever as it enters into its second century: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate-- (1) supports the wide-ranging preventive services that Planned Parenthood Federation of America doctors, nurses, and staff provide every day to patients across the United States; (2) recognizes that Planned Parenthood is a safety-net provider that reaches medically underserved people who are critically in need of compassionate care; (3) declares that Planned Parenthood should not be defunded, attacked, or discriminated against for their role as a vital women's health care provider across the country; and (4) affirms that Planned Parenthood remains an essential thread in the fabric of society, and it will be key in the next century to assisting millions of women, men, and young people in accessing the health care they need and deserve, no matter who they are or where they live. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, Congress has just passed a funding measure that will prevent a shutdown at the end of this week. As headlines across the country noted as the debate over this bill played out, it was delayed partly due to partisan attacks against women's health and one provider in particular--Planned Parenthood--that were shoehorned into the debate once again. Colleagues, this year Planned Parenthood turns 100 years old. You cannot look at the last 100 years and deny that monumental progress has been made with respect to women's health and rights--thanks to strong allies like Planned Parenthood. But that progress is what some members of this body want to roll back. When the first Planned Parenthood opened in 1916, it was illegal for women to get information about how to prevent a pregnancy. It is not surprising that at the time, one of the leading causes of death for women in the United States was complications from pregnancy and childbirth. From the get-go, Planned Parenthood said that women in America have a fundamental right to information about their reproductive health and access to care. It was about the right of all women to a healthy life and the pursuit of happiness. In 1965, Planned Parenthood Connecticut fought and won the Supreme Court decision that made birth control legal for married women. In 2010, Planned Parenthood was at the front lines of the battle, along with a lot of us here in the Senate, to ensure that birth control would be covered under the Affordable Care Act. Today, an estimated one in five women in America has been to a Planned Parenthood clinic for care at some point in her life. Eight out of ten Planned Parenthood patients live in or near poverty. As tough as it is for them to make ends meet, Planned Parenthood is a place they can turn to for important medical care from a provider they trust. Planned Parenthood at 100 years old has racked up some impressive points on the scoreboard. Each year Planned Parenthood provides educational programs to 1.5 million people. Planned Parenthood has doubled the number of health services it provides to men and has led the way in expanding access to health care for LGBT Americans. It has more than 650 health centers across the country and served two and a half million women and men last year. In my home State of Oregon, more than 70,000 Oregonians are served by 11 Planned Parenthood centers. I know firsthand from visiting with Planned Parenthood officials throughout Oregon in Portland, in Lane County, in central Oregon, how important these centers are to the health care of Oregonians. Planned Parenthood is at the heart of the revolution in women's health care over the last 100 years. It is the first place millions of American women turn to for health care--women from Portland, OR, to Portland, ME. Here are some of the services Planned Parenthood provides: birth control and counseling; pregnancy tests; prenatal services; HIV tests; safe, legal abortion services; breast cancer screenings; HPV vaccinations; cervical cancer screenings and prevention; ovarian cancer screenings; PAP tests; [[Page S6274]] exams for sexually transmitted diseases; treatment for urinary tract infections; basic physical exams; adoption referrals; family practice services; and nutrition programs. Despite all these critical services Planned Parenthood provides, every day, legislators attack Planned Parenthood. The fact is this crusade against Planned Parenthood is a crusade against the fundamental and constitutionally-protected right of women to make their own decisions about their bodies. Time and time again on the Senate floor and in debates with the other side, my Democratic colleagues and I have had to beat back the attempts to defund Planned Parenthood. Here is my bottom line colleagues. This country has made 100 years of progress on women's health, and it's not going to move backward. I urge my colleagues to honor the commitment to women's health and rights that Planned Parenthood has shown in the last 100 years by working in a bipartisan way to improve access to women's health care, instead of limiting it. Let us allow more women and men to access the health care they need and deserve, no matter who they are or where they live. Let us work to uphold the fundamental right of all women to make their own reproductive choices and access quality health care. Let us continue funding for Planned Parenthood and end these partisan attacks against this bedrock American health provider. Today, I am joined by 17 of my colleagues in introducing a resolution to formally recognize Planned Parenthood's immense contributions to progress for women's health and quality of life in America. It is time to end the unfounded attacks against Planned Parenthood and allow it to continue to provide critical health services for the next 100 years. ____________________",package_114_206.csv,10678,10678,10752,"[congressional record volume 162, number 148 (thursday, september 29, 2016)] [senate] [pages s6273-s6274] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] submitted resolutions ______ senate resolution 590--commemorating 100 years of health care services provided by planned parenthood mr. wyden (for himself, mrs. murray, mr. blumenthal, mr. brown, mrs. shaheen, ms. hirono, mr. franken, mr. bennet, mrs. gillibrand, mrs. boxer, ms. baldwin, mr. sanders, mr. leahy, mr. booker, mr. schumer, ms. warren, mr. durbin, ms. cantwell, and mrs. feinstein) submitted the following resolution;

whereas adults need to be part of a long-term solution to the educational challenges faced by the people of the united states; whereas many older people in the united states lack the reading, math, or english-language skills necessary to read a prescription and follow medical instructions, which endangers the lives of the older people and the lives of their loved ones;

whereas each person should have the opportunity to discover his or her history, culture, and heritage by exploring and experiencing the public land of the united states; whereas access to green spaces provides for healthier and more active lifestyles, which helps address numerous health disparity issues facing the latino community, such as diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease; whereas the participation of latinos in conservation efforts can encourage the interest and involvement of latinos in careers in conservation; whereas the people of the united states must ensure that the public land and natural surroundings of the united states are protected for future generations; and whereas the members of the largest ethnic group in the united states, as the environmental stewards of tomorrow, will play a significant role in securing the future success and preservation of the public land of the united states, especially as that group continues to grow; now, therefore, be it resolved, that the senate-- (1) recognizes the role of latinos in protecting and preserving the land, water, and wildlife of the united states; (2) supports the inclusion and meaningful engagement of latinos in environmental protection and conservation efforts;

Res. 607 Whereas, in an effort to improve the imagery intelligence, mapping, and geodesy capabilities of the United States, the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (in this preamble referred to as ``NIMA''), the predecessor of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (in this preamble referred to as the ``NGA''), was founded on October 1, 1996, as a result of President William Jefferson Clinton signing into law the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997 (Public Law 104-201; 110 Stat. 2422), which authorized the establishment of NIMA; Whereas the NGA derives from legacy agencies, including the Defense Mapping Agency, the National Photographic Interpretation Center, the Defense Airborne Reconnaissance Office, the Central Imagery Office, and the Defense Dissemination Program Office, that played vital roles in the defense of the United States in conflicts dating back to World War II and contributed to the discipline of geospatial intelligence (in this preamble referred to as ``GEOINT'') through imagery and mapping production; Whereas the NGA has, throughout its 20-year history, provided GEOINT support to United States policy makers and military commanders in both war and peacetime during significant national security and natural disaster events, including-- (1) the operations in the Balkans; (2) the response to Hurricane Katrina; (3) the operation that resulted in the killing of former al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden; (4) operations against state-sponsored terrorist organizations; (5) the humanitarian assistance responses to earthquakes in Haiti and Japan; and (6) the continued critical mission support to members of the Armed Forces in the Middle East; Whereas, with military and civilian employees serving at the NGA headquarters in Springfield, Virginia, the NGA West Campus in St. Louis, Missouri, and additional locations throughout the United States, and with personnel deployed worldwide in more than 200 locations in 17 countries, the NGA produces timely mapping, charting, geodesy, and intelligence products to warfighters, first responders, civil authorities, policy makers, and the maritime and aviation communities; Whereas the NGA motto describes the many missions that were combined 20 years ago upon the creation of the NGA, ``Know the Earth, show the way, and understand the world''; Whereas the NGA is the primary organization responsible for developing, maintaining, and enhancing the World Geodetic System 84 reference frame, the foundation for all of the Positioning, Navigation, and Timing systems of the Department of Defense, including the [[Page S6280]] Global Positioning System (commonly known as ``GPS''); Whereas the Maritime Safety Office of the NGA, which traces its lineage to 1869, collects, analyzes, and writes the Notices to Mariners that keep government, civilian, and international mariners informed about vital safety and navigational issues; Whereas the NGA also supports commercial vessels worldwide with navigational products and warning messages; Whereas, in addition to updating worldwide digital nautical charts that ensure safety of navigation to a broad base of users, the NGA has expanded to provide safety of navigation information to the aeronautical community; Whereas, in recent years, the NGA has increased its-- (1) worldwide, industry-leading aeronautical safety library to more than 10,000 flight procedures made available to the Department of Defense; and (2) vertical obstructions database from 4,000,000 features to more than 24,000,000 features; Whereas the NGA has converted from paper maps to downloadable digital maps, reducing the amount of gear that pilots need to carry while ensuring that those pilots always have the latest information; Whereas the NGA continues to be a constant source of innovation, aiding the efforts of the Department of Defense in counterterrorism and counterinsurgency operations by using new-- (1) intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance sensors and technologies; and (2) analytic methods, including full-motion video, hyperspectral imagery, overhead persistent infrared, light detection and ranging, and activity-based intelligence; Whereas the NGA continues to support warfighters and intelligence operators with dedicated efforts in global counterterrorism, counterproliferation, mission readiness, safety of navigation, and future weapons development; Whereas, since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the men and women of the NGA have worked diligently to deter, detect, and prevent acts of terrorism by providing GEOINT support to United States and coalition forces in support of the Global War on Terror, including Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa, Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq, and Operation Inherent Resolve in Iraq and Syria; Whereas the NGA is commendably pursuing new methods of intelligence collection and analysis to inform, complement, and add to the NGA's support of warfighter requirements by-- (1) embracing innovative cost-sharing and risk-sharing constructs with the commercial electro-optical satellite industry; and (2) looking to emerging commercial technology providers, including small satellite companies, that hold the promise of rapid technological innovation and potentially significant future cost savings to the taxpayers of the United States; and Whereas the NGA has been awarded 3 Joint Meritorious Unit Awards reflecting the distinctive accomplishments of the personnel assigned to the NGA: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate-- (1) congratulates the men and women of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency; (2) honors the professional men and women, past and present, of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency for their selfless service and dedication to the United States; and (3) expresses gratitude to all the men and women of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency for their past and continued efforts to provide timely, relevant, and accurate geospatial intelligence support to deliver overwhelming advantages to warfighters, defense planners, and national security policymakers in the defense and security of the United States. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6279-S6280] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SENATE RESOLUTION 607--RECOGNIZING THE NATIONAL GEOSPATIAL-INTELLIGENCE AGENCY ON ITS 20TH ANNIVERSARY Mr. BLUNT (for himself, Mr. Warner, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. Burr, and Mrs. Feinstein) submitted the following resolution;

There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the concurrent resolution. [[Page S6287]] Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Udall amendment to the concurrent resolution be agreed to; the concurrent resolution, as amended, be agreed to; that the Udall amendment to the preamble be agreed to; the preamble, as amended, be agreed to; and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.

This concurrent resolution may be cited as the ``Protection of the Right of Tribes to stop the Export of Cultural and Traditional Patrimony Resolution'' or the ``PROTECT Patrimony Resolution''. SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. In this resolution: (1) Native american.--The term ``Native American'' means-- (A) with respect to an individual, an individual who is a member of an Indian tribe (as defined in section 2 of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (25 U.S.C. 3001)); and (B) with respect to the cultural nature or significance of an item, right, or other object or concept, being of or significant to-- (i) an Indian tribe (as defined in section 2 of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (25 U.S.C. 3001)); or (ii) a Native Hawaiian organization (as defined in that section (25 U.S.C. 3001)). (2) Tribal cultural item.--The term ``tribal cultural item'' has the meaning given the term ``cultural item'' in section 2 of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (25 U.S.C. 3001). SEC. 3. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) Tribal cultural items-- (A) have ongoing historical, traditional, or cultural importance central to a Native American group or culture; (B) cannot be alienated, appropriated, or conveyed by any individual; and (C) are vital to Native American cultural survival and the maintenance of Native American ways of life. (2) The nature and description of tribal cultural items are sensitive and to be treated with respect and confidentiality, as appropriate.

(4) Tribal cultural items continue to be removed from the possession of Native Americans and sold in black or public markets in violation of Federal and tribal laws, including laws designed to protect Native American cultural property rights. (5) The illegal trade of tribal cultural items involves a sophisticated and lucrative black market, where the items are traded through domestic markets and then are often exported internationally. (6) Auction houses in foreign countries have held sales of tribal cultural items from the Pueblo of Acoma, the Pueblo of Laguna, the Pueblo of San Felipe, the Hopi Tribe, and other Indian tribes. (7) After tribal cultural items are exported internationally, Native Americans have difficulty stopping the sale of the items and securing their repatriation to their home communities, where the items belong. (8) Federal agencies have a responsibility to consult with Native Americans to stop the theft, illegal possession or sale, transfer, and export of tribal cultural items. (9) An increase in the investigation and successful prosecution of violations of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (25 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.) and the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 (16 U.S.C. 470aa et seq.) is necessary to deter illegal trading in tribal cultural items. (10) Many Indian tribes and tribal organizations have passed resolutions condemning the theft and sale of tribal cultural items, including the following: (A) The National Congress of American Indians passed Resolutions SAC-12-008 and SD-15-075 to call on the United States, in consultation with Native Americans-- (i) to address international repatriation; and (ii) to take affirmative actions to stop the theft and illegal sale of tribal cultural items both domestically and internationally. (B) The All Pueblo Council of Governors, representative of 20 Pueblo Indian tribes-- (i) noted that the Pueblo Indian tribes of the Southwestern United States have been disproportionately affected by the sale of tribal cultural items both domestically and internationally in violation of Federal and tribal laws; and (ii) passed Resolutions 2015-12 and 2015-13 to call on the United States, in consultation with Native Americans-- (I) to address international repatriation; and (II) to take affirmative actions to stop the theft and illegal sale of tribal cultural items both domestically and internationally. (C) The United South and Eastern Tribes, an intertribal organization comprised of 26 federally recognized Indian tribes, passed Resolution 2015:007, which calls on the United States to address all means to support the repatriation of tribal cultural items from beyond United States borders. (D) The Inter-Tribal Council of the Five Civilized Tribes, uniting the Chickasaw, Choctaw, Cherokee, Muscogee (Creek), and Seminole Nations, passed Resolution 12-07, which requests that the United States, after consultation with Native Americans, assist in international repatriation and take immediate action to address repatriation. SEC. 4. DECLARATION OF CONGRESS. Congress-- (1) condemns the theft, illegal possession or sale, transfer, and export of tribal cultural items; (2) calls on the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Attorney General to consult with Native Americans, including traditional Native American religious leaders, in addressing the practices described in paragraph (1)-- (A) to take affirmative action to stop the practices; and (B) to secure repatriation of tribal cultural items to Native Americans; (3) supports the efforts of the Comptroller General of the United States-- (A) to determine the scope of illegal trafficking in tribal cultural items domestically and internationally; and (B) to discuss with Native Americans, including traditional Native American religious leaders, relevant Federal officials, and other individuals and entities, as appropriate, the steps required-- (i) to end illegal trafficking in, and the export of, tribal cultural items; and (ii) to secure repatriation of tribal cultural items to the appropriate Native Americans; (4) supports the development of explicit restrictions on the export of tribal cultural items; and (5) encourages State and local governments and interested groups and organizations to work cooperatively in-- (A) deterring the theft, illegal possession or sale, transfer, and export of tribal cultural items; and (B) securing the repatriation of tribal cultural items to the appropriate Native Americans.

(C) The United South and Eastern Tribes, an intertribal organization comprised of 26 federally recognized Indian tribes, passed Resolution 2015:007, which calls on the United States to address all means to support the repatriation of tribal cultural items from beyond United States borders.

DUNCAN HUNTER of california in the house of representatives Thursday, September 22, 2016 Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1296, a bill to amend the San Luis Rey Indian Water Rights Settlement Act to clarify certain settlement terms, approves and ratifies a settlement agreement entered into among the United States; five Bands of Mission Indians in northern San Diego County; the City of Escondido, California; and the Vista Irrigation District. The settlement agreement was contemplated by the 1988 San Luis Rey Indian Water Rights Settlement Act, in which Congress, seeking to end decades of litigation, created a $30 million trust fund to be provided to the Bands with interest upon execution of a settlement. That amount was appropriated for the trust fund in 1989. The parties' settlement agreement requires ratification and approval by Congress in order to be effective, hence the introduction of H.R. 1296. After the House Natural Resources Committee reported H.R. 1296, the Congressional Budget Office concluded that the bill would increase net direct federal spending by $18 million over the 2017 through 2026 period. After further discussions, the bill was amended in a way that CBO concluded would eliminate the $18 million spending effect. Specifically, the amended H.R. 1296 provides that the money in the trust fund--rather than becoming fully available to the Bands immediately upon the settlement taking effect as the 1988 Act provided--would be made available at the rate of $3.7 million per year, with the Bands having the option to withdraw less than that amount. The House passed H.R. 1296 with this amendment on September 22, 2016. The only change regarding the trust fund that H.R. 1296 as amended makes to the 1988 Act is to change the rate at which the money in the trust fund is made available to the Bands. The full amount of the fund that Congress appropriated in 1989, including the interest that has been and will continue to be earned on that money, is unchanged. And crucially, the agreement to limit the annual allocations to no more than $3.7 million does not affect the Bands' right to eventually receive all of the money in the trust fund once the settlement takes effect. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1401] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SAN LUIS REY INDIAN WATER RIGHTS SETTLEMENT ACT AMENDMENT ______ speech of HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate and salute the life of Dr. Samuel ``Sam'' E. Curl, who passed away August 2, 2016. Sam grew up near Tolar, Texas, where he graduated from high school in 1955. After earning a junior college diploma at Tarleton State University in 1957, he continued on to Sam Houston State University where he received his bachelor's degree. Then he earned a master's degree in Animal Genetics from the University of Missouri and a Ph.D. in Animal Physiology from Texas A&M University. He earned the rank of Captain through his service in the United States Army. After his service, Dr. Curl was a Special Assistant to the President and then President of Phillips University in Enid, Oklahoma, and authored or co-authored three books and 95 scientific technical publications. Dr. Curl then moved to Texas Tech University, my alma mater, where he served a total 31 years, including three years as Associate Vice President for Academic Affairs. Before that, he was Dean of the College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources from 1979 to 1997. He moved to Oklahoma State University in 1997 to head their College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources, as well as being the Director of the Oklahoma Agricultural Experiment Station, and the Oklahoma Cooperative Extension Service. After retiring from working full time in 2004, Dr. Curl worked as a part-time consultant. For all of his amazing accomplishments as a professional and an academic, I knew Sam as a loving father and grandfather who delighted in spending time with his family. He was an active member of Acton United Methodist Church. His passions for fishing, travelling, sports, and musical theatre were well known to his friends and family. I know that his wife, Mary, and his children Jane, Julia, Karen, and stepchildren Ryan and Shelly will miss him dearly, as will his grandchildren Rachel, Robert, Greyson, Avery, Robert, and Daisy. Those who knew him, myself included, are better for having known Dr. Sam Curl, and I ask my colleagues to join me in this tribute to his wonderful life. He will be missed. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1401] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE OF SAM E.

CREC-2016-09-29-pt1-PgE1402-2,CREC-2016-09-29,114,THE MEDIGAP CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF 2016,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1402] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE MEDIGAP CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF 2016 ______ HON. JIM McDERMOTT of washington in the house of representatives Wednesday, September 28, 2016 Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, Medigap plans currently provide supplemental coverage to approximately 11 million Medicare beneficiaries. However, many of the laws governing the Medigap market have remained largely unchanged since 1990. In particular, consumer protections are inadequate, leaving many beneficiaries subject to discriminatory practices by issuers, lacking sufficient information about their plan options, and often enrolled in lower quality coverage. That is why, today, I am introducing the Medigap Consumer Protection Act. This important legislation will make a number of reforms to the Medigap market that will strengthen the health security of millions of Americans and significantly improve the beneficiary experience. Most importantly, this bill ends discriminatory treatment of Medicare beneficiaries by extending guaranteed issue rights to the entire Medigap-eligible population. Currently, federal law provides limited guaranteed issue rights to Medicare beneficiaries. As a result, issuers in many states are permitted to deny consumers access to Medigap policies based on preexisting conditions. This creates substantial barriers to coverage, particularly for individuals who qualify for Medicare due to disability or End-Stage Renal Disease. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, only 2 percent of beneficiaries who are under 65 and living with a disability are enrolled in a Medigap policy, and 21 percent have no supplemental coverage at all. The Medigap Consumer Protection Act closes the holes in federal law that permit discriminatory treatment of consumers by extending guaranteed issue rights to the entire Medicare population, including beneficiaries who qualify for Medicare due to disability or End-Stage Renal Disease. It also will protect a number of other populations, including beneficiaries who have enrolled in Medicare Advantage for more than one year and wish to switch back to traditional Medicare; dual eligibles who either lose their Medicaid coverage or who are only Medicaid- eligible with a Share of Cost; and individuals enrolled in COBRA coverage who wish to switch into Medicare. The bill also makes a number of reforms that will strengthen access to quality plans and improve the beneficiary experience. It calls on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to review loss ratio standards for Medigap plans and submit recommendations to the Secretary to update federal standards. It reforms how issuers price their products by calling on the NAIC to update its Model Regulations to prohibit pricing discrimination based on age, and by requiring Medigap issuers to set premiums by county. It requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to improve the Medicare Plan Finder website to increase consumer access to information regarding their coverage options through Medicare, Medigap, Medicare Advantage, and Part D. The public will be afforded opportunities to comment on and improve the presentation of this information. It restores access to the most popular Medigap plan options, which under current law are scheduled to be eliminated for beneficiaries who become eligible for Medicare beginning in 2020 or later. Finally, it provides consumers with additional information about potential conflicts of interest by requiring issuers to disclose payments made to brokers, agents, and other third parties selling Medigap policies. These disclosures will be available to consumers through the Open Payments Database maintained by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Mr. Speaker, Medicare beneficiaries deserve access to high-quality Medigap coverage. The reforms made by the Medigap Consumer Protection Act will correct many of the problems that continue to exist in the market, including discrimination by issuers and a lack of information available to consumers. These reforms are long overdue, and I urge my colleagues to move to enact this bill without delay. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1402] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE MEDIGAP CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF 2016 ______ HON. JIM McDERMOTT of washington in the house of representatives Wednesday, September 28, 2016 Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, Medigap plans currently provide supplemental coverage to approximately 11 million Medicare beneficiaries. However, many of the laws governing the Medigap market have remained largely unchanged since 1990. In particular, consumer protections are inadequate, leaving many beneficiaries subject to discriminatory practices by issuers, lacking sufficient information about their plan options, and often enrolled in lower quality coverage. That is why, today, I am introducing the Medigap Consumer Protection Act. This important legislation will make a number of reforms to the Medigap market that will strengthen the health security of millions of Americans and significantly improve the beneficiary experience. Most importantly, this bill ends discriminatory treatment of Medicare beneficiaries by extending guaranteed issue rights to the entire Medigap-eligible population. Currently, federal law provides limited guaranteed issue rights to Medicare beneficiaries. As a result, issuers in many states are permitted to deny consumers access to Medigap policies based on preexisting conditions. This creates substantial barriers to coverage, particularly for individuals who qualify for Medicare due to disability or End-Stage Renal Disease. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, only 2 percent of beneficiaries who are under 65 and living with a disability are enrolled in a Medigap policy, and 21 percent have no supplemental coverage at all. The Medigap Consumer Protection Act closes the holes in federal law that permit discriminatory treatment of consumers by extending guaranteed issue rights to the entire Medicare population, including beneficiaries who qualify for Medicare due to disability or End-Stage Renal Disease. It also will protect a number of other populations, including beneficiaries who have enrolled in Medicare Advantage for more than one year and wish to switch back to traditional Medicare; dual eligibles who either lose their Medicaid coverage or who are only Medicaid- eligible with a Share of Cost; and individuals enrolled in COBRA coverage who wish to switch into Medicare. The bill also makes a number of reforms that will strengthen access to quality plans and improve the beneficiary experience. It calls on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to review loss ratio standards for Medigap plans and submit recommendations to the Secretary to update federal standards. It reforms how issuers price their products by calling on the NAIC to update its Model Regulations to prohibit pricing discrimination based on age, and by requiring Medigap issuers to set premiums by county. It requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to improve the Medicare Plan Finder website to increase consumer access to information regarding their coverage options through Medicare, Medigap, Medicare Advantage, and Part D. The public will be afforded opportunities to comment on and improve the presentation of this information. It restores access to the most popular Medigap plan options, which under current law are scheduled to be eliminated for beneficiaries who become eligible for Medicare beginning in 2020 or later. Finally, it provides consumers with additional information about potential conflicts of interest by requiring issuers to disclose payments made to brokers, agents, and other third parties selling Medigap policies. These disclosures will be available to consumers through the Open Payments Database maintained by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Mr. Speaker, Medicare beneficiaries deserve access to high-quality Medigap coverage. The reforms made by the Medigap Consumer Protection Act will correct many of the problems that continue to exist in the market, including discrimination by issuers and a lack of information available to consumers.

DEREK KILMER of washington in the house of representatives Wednesday, September 28, 2016 Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and legacy of Richard Geiger, a champion for the environment. Mr. Geiger is widely recognized as one of the most committed advocates for the protection and stewardship of our natural resources in the Puget Sound region. A graduate of Gonzaga University in Spokane, WA, Rich began his career by serving our country in the 82nd Airborne Division as an air defense officer. After serving for 13 years, during which time he was stationed in North Korea and Germany, he continued that commitment to service by dedicating his civilian career to protecting the environment. First working for Mason County Public Works, and then for the last 15 years as a district officer at the Mason Conservation District, Rich helped to develop a wide range of small- and large-scale efforts to protect natural resources. Perhaps his greatest accomplishment during his tenure with the Conservation District was the leadership he provided on the development and implementation of the Skokomish River Basin Ecosystem Restoration Project, a critical and comprehensive effort to restore the river and surrounding waters in Puget Sound that encompassed more than 50 different individual restoration projects. Mr. Speaker, Richard was not only an environmental advocate and steward, he was also a leader in the community. He excelled at fostering collaboration and consensus among diverse community stakeholders, including private landowners, businesses, Native American Tribes, and local, state, and federal agencies, to achieve common goals. Richard's lifetime of service, stewardship, care, and leadership all contributed to a stronger, healthier, and more vibrant community in Puget Sound. The contributions of Mr. Geiger embody the values that make our community and our country a great place to live. Mr. Speaker, I stand on the House floor today to honor the life of Mr. Geiger and to extend my condolences to those who he is survived by. Our lives are enhanced by having known him, and he will truly be missed.

ALMA S. ADAMS of north carolina in the house of representatives Wednesday, September 28, 2016 Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, in my District--North Carolina's 12th Congressional District--many people in my community struggle to consistently put food on the table. According to Feeding America, Mecklenburg County has over 165,000 individuals that are considered food insecure, including over 49,000 children. Overall, the 12th district ranks 11th in the nation and 2nd in the state for the most food insecure congressional districts. Over the past year, the single biggest food insecurity issue that constituents share with my office is that SNAP benefits are not enough to help seniors and families in need put food on the table through the end of the month. For this reason, in May of this year, I introduced H.R. 5215, the Closing the Meal Gap Act of 2016. This legislation strengthens the SNAP program for seniors, families, and individuals looking for work.

STEVE COHEN of tennessee in the house of representatives Wednesday, September 28, 2016 Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the men and women of the Tennessee State University (TSU) Aristocrat of Bands marching band and the Sophisticated Ladies majorettes for their performance at the White House reception for the grand opening ceremony of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. TSU has an over 100-year-long history as a historically black university and, as the first historically black university band to appear on national television and the first to march in an Inaugural Parade for President John F. Kennedy, it was fitting for the Aristocrat of Bands to perform in Washington, DC during this historic event in our nation's history. The TSU Aristocrat of Bands began in 1946 as a 100-piece ensemble. Since that time, the band has become world-renowned for its performances across the country. During the late 1940s, the marching band performed twice in Washington, DC in the Washington Classic, a national competition for top historical black colleges and universities. Under the direction of Frank T. Greer, the marching band became the first historically black university band to appear on television when it performed during the half-time show of a Chicago Bears and Los Angeles Rams football game. The band went on to perform during nine half-time shows between 1956 and 1978, including the New York Giants vs. the Chicago Bears National Championship in 1963 at Wrigley Field. Between 1979 and 2014, the band was directed by Edward L. Graves--a former Aristocrat under Director Greer who marched during the 1961 inauguration of President Kennedy. Under his tutelage, the band continued to perform for half-time shows, had a spot in the 1981 CBS television movie The Concrete Cowboy, recorded for television ads and traveled abroad to perform in Tokyo, Japan. In 1993, the Aristocrat of Bands returned to Washington, DC to march in President Bill Clinton's Inaugural Parade. The Aristocrat of Bands performed several songs for the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture opening reception, including No Problems by Chance the Rapper, Signed Sealed Delivered I'm Yours by Stevie Wonder, Gin and Juice by Snoop Dogg and TSU's fight song, I'm So Proud. The Aristocrat of Bands and the Sophisticated Ladies represented TSU well and, like TSU students who are proud of their school and marching band, I was proud to watch the band perform on the South Lawn of the White House. I congratulate Director Dr. Reginald McDonald, the men and women of the Aristocrat of Bands, and the Sophisticated Ladies for being selected for this honor and putting on a performance worthy of the school's legacy. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1403] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY ARISTOCRAT OF BANDS MARCHING BAND AND THE SOPHISTICATED LADIES MAJORETTES FOR THEIR PERFORMANCE AT THE WHITE HOUSE RECEPTION FOR THE GRAND OPENING OF THE SMITHSONIAN NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY AND CULTURE ______ HON.

MARTHA McSALLY of arizona in the house of representatives Wednesday, September 28, 2016 Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to the life of Border Patrol Agent Manuel ``Manny'' Alvarez. Agent Alvarez entered duty as a member of the Border Patrol Academy Class of 557 on July 17, 2003. He was a dedicated agent who strove to be his best each time he put on the uniform. Agent Alvarez dutifully served our country in the Border Patrol for 13 years. During that time he became well known for his commitment to excellence, warm personality, and humble demeanor. He was a man who looked out for his fellow agents and did what was necessary to ensure the optimal performance of his team. He was always willing to take time to teach or train newer agents or share what he had learned. On August 11, 2016 Agent Alvarez was killed while on duty on the Tohono O'odham Nation Reservation just south of Sells, Arizona. Even after over a decade of service, Manny's love and drive for his work was as strong as the day he entered the Border Patrol. Agent Alvarez was only 37 at the time of his death. He is survived by his wife, Jeanine, and four children, Analysia, Yaslyne, Julian, and Gabriel, and was deeply committed to his family. He also was an avid runner and had a natural talent for drawing. There's no doubt that such a tragic loss is felt across our entire community and by the Border Patrol Agency to which he gave so much. On behalf of Southern Arizonans, I thank Agent Alvarez for his service to keep our country and communities safe, and I offer my sincere condolences to his family and friends on the loss of one of our community's finest. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1403] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO BP AGENT MANUEL ``MANNY'' ALVAREZ ______ HON.

BETTY McCOLLUM of minnesota in the house of representatives Wednesday, September 28, 2016 Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Saint Paul, Minnesota's Central High School on its 150th anniversary. Dedicated faculty and staff of Central have been educating and inspiring generations of Minnesota's future leaders since it was founded in 1866 as the first public high school in our state. As the largest public high school in Minnesota, Central is well-known not only for its rich history and traditions, but also for its commitment to academic excellence, diversity and inclusion. Saint Paul Central High School was established in response to student-driven demand for a high school in Minnesota, to allow students to continue their education beyond elementary school. Since then, this commitment to students has remained a core part of Central's mission and identity. The first graduating class of Saint Paul Central High School consisted of two students who each received a hand-printed sheepskin diploma in 1870. As the years went on, the school began to grow, moving to a new space in 1872 and again in 1883. In 1912, it moved to a new location, where it stands today, and adopted the Minuteman as its mascot in recognition of its address on Lexington Avenue. Throughout the years, many students who walked the halls of Central High School would go on to inspire, connect, and change our community and world. It has been the alma mater to the likes of Amelia Earhart, the first women to pilot a trans-Atlantic flight, Charles M.

BETTY McCOLLUM of minnesota in the house of representatives Wednesday, September 28, 2016 Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Saint Paul, Minnesota's Central High School on its 150th anniversary. Dedicated faculty and staff of Central have been educating and inspiring generations of Minnesota's future leaders since it was founded in 1866 as the first public high school in our state. As the largest public high school in Minnesota, Central is well-known not only for its rich history and traditions, but also for its commitment to academic excellence, diversity and inclusion. Saint Paul Central High School was established in response to student-driven demand for a high school in Minnesota, to allow students to continue their education beyond elementary school. Since then, this commitment to students has remained a core part of Central's mission and identity. The first graduating class of Saint Paul Central High School consisted of two students who each received a hand-printed sheepskin diploma in 1870. As the years went on, the school began to grow, moving to a new space in 1872 and again in 1883. In 1912, it moved to a new location, where it stands today, and adopted the Minuteman as its mascot in recognition of its address on Lexington Avenue. Throughout the years, many students who walked the halls of Central High School would go on to inspire, connect, and change our community and world. It has been the alma mater to the likes of Amelia Earhart, the first women to pilot a trans-Atlantic flight, Charles M. Schulz, the creator of the beloved Peanuts gang, and Jawed Karim, co-creator of YouTube. Today's Central High School students are no less impressive.

DEBBIE DINGELL of michigan in the house of representatives Wednesday, September 28, 2016 Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dan Cohen for his service as a member of the Congressional Award Board of Directors. The United States Congress established the Congressional Award in 1979 to recognize initiative, achievement, and service in young people. It began as a bipartisan effort in both the United States Senate and the House of Representatives. The original bill was sponsored by the late Senator Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming and the late Congressman James Howard of New Jersey. Originally signed into law by President Jimmy Carter, the legislation (Public Law 96-114) established the Congressional Award as a public-private partnership, which receives all funding from the private sector. Every president since, both Democratic and Republican, have signed legislation to continue the program. The Congressional Award Board of Directors is comprised of 48 members and supports the work of the foundation by providing mission-based leadership and strategic governance. Every member of the Board serves as a volunteer to help make the program a national opportunity available in every congressional district. During this past year, over 40,000 participants from all 50 states were actively working toward earning a Congressional Award and 5,000 new participants enrolled in the program. Since its inception, over 7 million hours of service have been contributed to communities nationwide. The example set by Dan is one we all should strive for. His willingness to serve his community and our nation's young people sets him apart as an outstanding individual, and I have been honored to serve alongside of him as Leader Pelosi's congressional appointee to the Board. I ask that all of my colleagues in the House of Representatives join me in thanking Dan for his service and wishing him nothing but continued success. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1404] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING DAN COHEN ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, today I am pleased to reintroduce the Prepare All Kids Act--important legislation to strengthen the availability of high-quality prekindergarten for families across the country. In my home city of New York, we have more children enrolled in full- day pre-K than 49 states as part of our effort to guarantee universal pre-K for all families. But across the country too few families have access to good prekindergarten programs that will help their children enter elementary school ready to learn and succeed. That is why I have introduced the Prepare All Kids Act along with Senator Bob Casey. This bill would authorize a Prekindergarten Incentive Fund to award grants to states that establish, expand, or enhance full-day pre-K programs. These grants will help states launch or expand high-quality programs that are proven to help children excel in school and help working families succeed. I am proud of President Obama's commitment to these goals, by expanding Head Start and Early Head Start, and making early childhood education a priority. Congress must build on these efforts by passing legislation to ensure that all children benefit from high-quality prekindergarten. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1404] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF PREPARE ALL KIDS ACT ______ HON.

Over the decades the small group that started Calvary Baptist has now grown to over 1,700 people that comprise the membership of Calvary Baptist Church. Over the years, hundreds of men, women, and children have placed their faith in Christ through ministries of Calvary Baptist Church. For 50 years, Calvary has been a leader in the church community by reaching out to those in need physically and spiritually and by providing food, finances, and counseling as well as caring for the hurting, grieving, and lonely. Calvary Baptist has been very involved in sharing the good news of Jesus with many in other countries as well. Every year several groups travel from Republic to other states and foreign countries to perform work-related projects on facilities, orphanages, and rehabilitation centers and to conduct Bible programs for children, teenagers and medical and sports camps. Mr. Speaker, Calvary Baptist deserves this body's utmost respect for its desire to be an integral part of the Republic community and providing an outlet for so many to help others.

SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. of georgia in the house of representatives Wednesday, September 28, 2016 Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor and pleasure to extend my sincerest congratulations to Pastor Daniel Simmons, leader of my church home, Mount Zion Baptist Church in Albany, Georgia. Pastor Simmons will be celebrating 25 years of outstanding ministry to Mount Zion Baptist Church on Sunday, October 9, 2016. A native of Cairo, Georgia, Daniel Simmons was born to the late Mrs. Pinkie Norwood Simmons and the late Reverend Perry Simmons, Sr. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Sociology from Albany State College, now University, in 1977. He went on to earn a Master of Arts degree in Counseling from the University of Georgia in 1985 and a Doctorate of Ministry from Bethany Theological Seminary in Dothan, Alabama in 1991. Pastor Simmons worked as a Rehabilitation Counselor with the Georgia Department of Rehabilitation Services for seventeen years. He also worked as a Community Development Specialist. Pastor Simmons began preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ in June 1984. He pastored Mountain Grove Baptist Church in Dawson, Georgia and Pleasant Grove Baptist Church in Shingler, Georgia. In 1991, the Lord called him to lead Mount Zion Baptist Church. In his 25 years of leadership, Mount Zion has expanded its Ministry services, increased its membership tremendously to the point where a second worship service was added, and moved into its new state-of-the-art facility on 109 acres of land at 901 South Westover Boulevard in 2010. But most importantly, Pastor Simmons has led Mount Zion Baptist Church to become a pillar in the community, known for ministering to those in need. Pastor Simmons welcomes anyone and everyone into the church and its members make it their duty to ensure that every soul is taken care of and prayed over. With a congregation of over 3,000 members and 54 ministries, including radio, television, and live- streaming, Mount Zion is truly ``reaching the world for Christ through evangelism, discipleship, fellowship, and missions.'' Mount Zion Baptist Church is celebrating another happy occasion--its 151st anniversary. The church was founded in 1865, the same year that the Thirteenth Amendment abolishing slavery was passed by Congress and ratified by the States. Nearly a century later, many of the rallies during the Albany phase of the Civil Rights Movement were held at Mount Zion. To commemorate those struggles, the church donated the building to the Albany Civil Rights Museum which is currently housed there. Mount Zion has seen many ups and downs but God's will and our members' perseverance have shaped it into the expansive and successful place of worship it is today. Jeremiah 3:15 says, ``Then I will give you shepherds after my own heart, who will lead you with knowledge and understanding.'' Pastor Daniel Simmons is one such shepherd and a man of integrity who exudes the genuine principles and values of Christian discipleship. Over the 20 years I have been a member of the church, I am proud to call Mount Zion my church home and Pastor Daniel Simmons my pastor. As an ordained Deacon and Trustee, I have personally witnessed the unshakeable faith Pastor Simmons has for the Lord and the profound exegesis he conveys in his sermons. My wife, Vivian, and I are grateful that we can always count on Pastor Simmons' wise counsel and sage advice. Pastor Simmons has achieved many things in his life but none of this would have been possible without the love and support of his wife and First Lady of the Church, Diane Davis Simmons, and his two children and five grandchildren. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me, my wife Vivian, and the more than 730,000 residents of Georgia's Second Congressional District in thanking Pastor Daniel [[Page E1405]] Simmons for 25 outstanding years of service to Mount Zion Baptist Church and a lifetime of service in the ministry of Jesus Christ. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1404-E1405] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN HONOR OF PASTOR DANIEL SIMMONS ______ HON.

Since Congress established the Federal Farm Loan Act in 1916, many farmers and producers have relied on the Farm Credit System for access to capital and financial opportunity. With this incredible program comes more freedom, opportunity, and prosperity for the agriculture community across our nation. It's a critical piece of our duty to help ensure we can keep farmers on their farms. Back home in North Carolina, we know how important it is to have a prosperous and productive agriculture industry. We respect and admire the men and women who toil our lands and work incredibly hard to provide food and products we depend on in our daily lives. The Farm Credit System is a vital part of this chain, and it ensures we can continue supporting the prosperity of agriculture producers of all sizes and types. Across North Carolina, more than 14,800 farmers and producers rely on the Farm Credit System to borrow the capital they need to make their businesses successful and provide food and fiber to our communities. Many of these people are young and just starting out in the agriculture industry or are on small farms. As we commemorate a century of service, we say thank you to our farmers and producers for their hard work to ensure our agriculture community remains strong, both now and for generations to come.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my constituent, Ms. Grace Vanderwaal, an inspiring young woman and this year's winner of America's Got Talent. Grace is a 12-year-old singer-songwriter from Suffern, New York, who started writing music at the age of three when she would make up songs with her wireless microphone. She was introduced to ukulele music by a family friend, and then decided to use her birthday money from her 11th birthday to buy her own ukulele. A true musical prodigy, Grace mastered the ukulele within a year, now owning five ukuleles, as well as a piano and a saxophone. Grace began performing at local establishments for small audiences, but had never played before a large crowd until this past summer. She shared her amazing talents with the world when she auditioned for Season 11 of America's Got Talent and played her original song, ``I Don't Know My Name,'' a song about finding who you are and where you fit in, while playing the ukulele. Grace impressed the judges so much she was sent straight to the ``Live Shows.'' Grace continued astonishing audiences, performing original pieces as she advanced in each round of the show, and on September 14, was crowned the first prize winner, taking home a $1 million prize, a Las Vegas show date, and a record contract. Before the Las Vegas show, Grace will return home to Suffern for a Saturday, October 1 parade and celebration with her family, neighbors, and schoolmates. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize my extremely talented constituent, Ms. Grace Vanderwaal, and I urge my colleagues to join me in congratulating her on this achievement. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1405] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO MS.

JERRY McNERNEY of california in the house of representatives Wednesday, September 28, 2016 Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the life of Betty Smith, who passed away on April 24, 2016. Betty spent most of her life in Knightsen, California preserving the rich farming culture of East Contra Costa County. She began contributing to her community at a young age. While attending Liberty High School, she co-wrote the lyrics to the school's anthem, which is still used by the Liberty Lions today. After high school, she studied at University of the Pacific in Stockton, and worked at Fiberboard in Antioch. Betty continued her service by teaching preschool for many years and participating in the Knightsen Garden Club and 4-H Club. Betty and her husband, William R. Smith, continued the family farm started by her parents. As a multi-generation family farm in Knightsen, Smith Family Farm is known for many varieties of stone fruits, tomatoes, zucchinis, apples and cruciferous greens. Each year, the Farm holds a Tomato Festival and Pumpkin Harvest Festival to celebrate the fresh crops of East Contra Costa County. Over the last 25 years, Betty greeted visitors from near and far when they arrived at Smith Family Farm to purchase fresh fruits and vegetables during the U-pick season. She engaged the visiting children with her barn show and taught them about farming, nature and local history using songs, stories, and [[Page E1406]] music. Betty was the matriarch and heart of Smith Family Farm. Betty showed devotion to her community through many years of service to the children and families that came to the farm. Her love of the arts, dedication to education, and commitment to others is an inspiration for our community. It is for these reasons that I ask my Colleagues to join me in honoring the memory of Betty Smith and her lifetime of service. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1405-E1406] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE OF BETTY SMITH ______ HON.

BOB GOODLATTE of virginia in the house of representatives Wednesday, September 28, 2016 Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, fellowship, good will, and community service. These are the characteristics that Ruritan National clubs across the nation strive to achieve, and the principles that the Dayton Ruritan Club has embodied for the past 75 years. Chartered on September 30, 1941, the Dayton Ruritan Club is celebrating 75 years of service to the Dayton, Virginia, community. In rural areas across the country, neighbors look out for one another and help each other in good times and bad. Those principles are why the Dayton club came about--to help provide a hand up for friends and neighbors in need. A group of citizens saw a need in the community and worked to raise money and provide volunteer labor to help address those needs. Now, 75 years later, these men and women play an ever important role, having contributed over $700,000 and 180,000 volunteer hours to their community. In Dayton, Ruritan National Club Number 126 carries on this rich tradition of serving others and keeping it local. Every penny they raise through numerous fundraising events each year, including a bluegrass concert, pancake breakfast, and sandwich sales, goes towards projects to improve the place where they live. Whether it is providing dictionaries to every fifth grade student in Rockingham County or donating teddy bears for first responders to give to children, the projects have made a lasting impact on the community. Members are also actively working to mold the next generation of leaders by forming a Ruri-Teen Chapter at Turner Ashby High School and Wilbur Pence Middle School. While much has changed around them over the years, the Dayton Ruritan Club remains committed to the community they call home. Seventy-five years of service is a remarkable achievement, and I applaud the members of the Dayton Ruritan Club for their devotion to service. On October 13, members and friends will come together to celebrate their accomplishments and this milestone at the 75th Anniversary Banquet. I wish them many more years of success as they serve the Town of Dayton. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1406] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CELEBRATING THE DAYTON RURITAN CLUB'S 75 YEARS OF SERVICE ______ HON.

Guiding members through livestock projects, his passion for the world of agriculture was the legacy he passed on. Brenda grew up in 4-H and was an active member from elementary school through her high school years. She led the U.S. Sunshine 4-H group and was co-leader to the Trailblazers.

STEVE COHEN of tennessee in the house of representatives Wednesday, September 28, 2016 Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the young men and women of the Stax Music Academy (SMA) in Memphis, Tennessee for their outstanding performance on the main stage at the ``Freedom Sounds: A Community Celebration'' festival on the National Mall for the grand opening of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. Students from SMA have performed around the world and it was fitting for the school to be invited to perform in Washington, DC for this historic event in our nation's history. The Stax Music Academy began in 2000 at Stafford Elementary School as a Soulsville Foundation after school and summer music learning center. SMA is now located next to Stax Museum where the historic Stax Records was founded. Under Presidents and CEOs of the Foundation, including Memphian and celebrated jazz saxophonist, Kirk Whalum, SMA developed a program that has served more than 4,000 students in the studies of vocals, instruments, music writing, music theory and music production. SMA students have performed for and alongside world- renowned artists, including Isaac Hayes, Mavis Staples, Stevie Wonder, Brandford Marsalis, Ben Cauley of the Bar-Kays and many more. Additionally, SMA students have opened for BB King at his annual BB King Homecoming Festival and Concert, performed at the Levitt Shell in Memphis's Overton Park opening for Booker T. Jones and sang backup for Faith Hill during the 2008 Freedom Awards Dinner and Ceremony hosted by the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis. Stax Music Academy students have also traveled the country and world sharing their talents for all to hear. Audiences have included Oprah Winfrey and President Bill Clinton as well as the U.S. Ambassador to Australia during performances in Australia and the U.S. Ambassador to Germany during the grand opening of the ``Memphis Exhibition Berlin'' in Berlin, Germany. SMA students have traveled to Porretta Terme, Italy for the Porretta Soul Festival in Rufus Thomas Park, performed at The Kennedy Center in Washington, DC for a July 4th performance and participated in the Smithsonian Institute's Smithsonian Folklife Festival on the National Mall in 2011. In addition to excelling in the performing arts, since 2008, every SMA senior has been accepted to a college or university. I was very happy for Stax Music Academy when I learned that its students were scheduled to perform in Washington, DC for the opening festivities of the National Museum of African American History and Culture. The students performed several legendary songs by Stax recording artists, including ``I've Been Loving You Too Long'' by Otis Redding and ``Walking the Dog'' by Rufus Thomas, and covered songs by Stax artists Sam and Dave and the Staple Singers as well as songs by Prince and Queen. The performers represented Stax Music Academy, the city of Memphis and Memphis's musical legacy well, and I am proud of this latest milestone in the Academy's storied history. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1406] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING STAX MUSIC ACADEMY FOR ITS PERFORMANCE AT THE ``FREEDOM SOUNDS: A COMMUNITY CELEBRATION'' FESTIVAL FOR THE GRAND OPENING OF THE SMITHSONIAN NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY AND CULTURE ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of Lesley Chiller, who passed away Saturday, August 27, 2016, at the age of 40 as a result of complications from lupus. Lesley was born July 30, 1976, in Boston and raised in Sharon, Massachusetts. She graduated from Sharon High School where she excelled in English and writing. Following a year at the University of New Hampshire, Lesley earned a BA in Economics from the University of Massachusetts-Boston and a Certificate in Graphic Design from Pima College. An avid reader and music lover, Lesley enjoyed art, history, food anthropology, and politics where her deep passion for social justice was apparent. Family and friends knew Lesley to be wise and kind, but also armed with an unending sense of humor that was both intelligent and dry, even during the most trying times of her 10-year battle with lupus. Mr. Speaker, I co-founded the Congressional Lupus Caucus because we have a responsibility to fight back against this cruel and debilitating illness. Lupus is a chronic, autoimmune disease that can force your immune system to destroy healthy tissue, which often leads to terrible pain that can manifest itself throughout the body. I ask that my colleagues join me in the fight against lupus by joining the Congressional Lupus Caucus, and further by helping us boost federal funding to fight this disease through the National Institutes of Health and other means. We owe that not only to the memory of Lesley Chiller but also the 1.5 million Americans suffering with this affliction every day. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1407] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF LESLEY CHILLER ______ HON.

CREC-2016-09-29-pt1-PgE1407-2,CREC-2016-09-29,114,TWO MILLION AMERICANS ALIVE TODAY BECAUSE OF THE HYDE AMENDMENT,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1407] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TWO MILLION AMERICANS ALIVE TODAY BECAUSE OF THE HYDE AMENDMENT ______ HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH of new jersey in the house of representatives Wednesday, September 28, 2016 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, Friday September 30 marks 40 years since the life-saving Hyde Amendment was first enacted. This annual appropriations amendment stops taxpayer dollars from being used to fund most abortions and abortion coverage through government programs like Medicaid. Thanks to new analysis by the Charlotte Lozier Institute we now know that as many as 2 million children--some obviously much older now--are alive today because of the Hyde amendment. Prior to enactment of Hyde, the Medicaid program paid for about 300,000 abortions annually. Research, including by the pro-abortion Guttmacher Institute, has long shown that stopping taxpayer funded abortion reduces the abortion rate. In an analysis released just this week, the Charlotte Lozier Institute estimates that the Hyde amendment saves as many as 60,000 lives each year. I remember the day several years ago when my friend and author of the amendment, Henry Hyde of Illinois, first learned that about one million children were alive because of his amendment. He was overcome with joy knowing that a million mothers were spared the agony of post abortion pain, a million children were alive and well, growing up, going to school, playing sports, dating, marrying and having kids of their own. Today that number is estimated at two million--all because abortion subsidies have been prohibited by law. Since the first bitter and protracted battles over this policy, the Hyde amendment has generally, if begrudgingly, been accepted as the status quo. President Bill Clinton--who supported partial-birth abortion--and President Barack Obama--who pledged to veto a bill protecting children born alive after abortion, both consistently signed the Hyde amendment into law. Yet Hillary Clinton represents a new era of pro-abortion extremism. Not only does she fall in party line with her opposition to the Pain- Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, the ban on sex selection abortion, and the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, she will have an abortion litmus-test for every judge and justice. And in a new assault on innocent human life, she has vowed to decimate the Hyde Amendment and fund abortion on demand using taxpayer dollars. In 1980 the Hyde amendment narrowly overcame a constitutional challenge in a 5-4 Supreme Court decision. If Hillary Clinton appoints just one justice, the Hyde amendment will be nullified. Hillary Clinton is outside of the mainstream. Today, more Americans support the sanctity of life and oppose taxpayer funding for abortions than ever. An ever-growing majority in America believes that our government should not fund abortion. A July 2016 Marist poll found that nearly two-thirds of Americans oppose taxpayer funding for abortion--including 45% of those who identify as ``pro-choice.'' The Hyde Amendment is not extreme. Hillary Clinton is. Hillary Clinton is so extreme and outside the mainstream that when MSNBC's Chuck Todd asked her in an April 3rd interview: ``When, and if, does an unborn child have constitutional rights?'' Hillary Clinton fired back: ``unborn persons don't have constitutional rights . . .'' Clinton acknowledges that unborn children are persons, but denies them their right to life and wants taxpayers to pay for their destruction. When Hillary Clinton was awarded the Margaret Sanger award by Planned Parenthood in 2009, she said she was ``in awe'' of Margaret Sanger, the infamous founder of Planned Parenthood. Shockingly its American affiliate alone claims responsibility for the death of over seven million babies. In her 2009 speech Clinton also said she admired Sanger for her vision and that Sanger's work here in the United States and across the globe was not done. ``Not done'' means more abortions, paid for by the taxpayer, and an end to conscience rights for those who don't agree. If we lose the Hyde Amendment our country will be carrying out Sanger's eugenic legacy--incentivizing the destruction of the poor and vulnerable by paying for their death. There are nearly 60 million Americans missing from 43 years of legal abortion. 60 million lives with potential that have been snuffed out by state-sanctioned killing. Let's be clear. Hillary Clinton poses an existential threat to the welfare and wellbeing of unborn children and their mothers in the United States and around the world. Rather than expand the culture of death and shred the Hyde amendment--as Hillary Clinton promises--women and men of conscience have a duty to protect the weakest and most vulnerable from the violence of abortion. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1407] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TWO MILLION AMERICANS ALIVE TODAY BECAUSE OF THE HYDE AMENDMENT ______ HON.

Mr. Ellis passed away prematurely on September 10, 2016 at the age of 49. On behalf of my family and staff, I wish to extend our sympathy and good wishes to his family. Mr. Ellis was raised by a single mother in Mocksville, North Carolina and Cleveland, Ohio. He returned to North Carolina to attend Winston- Salem State University (WSSU), graduating with a degree in teaching. While at WSSU, he met his wife Lisa, with whom he raised five children. Mr. Ellis began his involvement with the North Carolina Association of Educators [[Page E1408]] (NCAE) as a student at WSSU, serving as president of the campus affiliate of the organization. He later served as president of the Forsyth County chapter. In 2008, Mr. Ellis became vice president of NCAE, and in 2012 he was elected President. As an advocate and a leader, Rodney Ellis was energetic and effective, reflecting a passion for ensuring access to education for all students. He defended public investments in our schools at a time when they were under threat, first from the Great Recession and then from hostile political leadership. Mr. Ellis stepped down from the NCAE presidency in July after serving the maximum two two-year terms. He returned to Winston-Salem to spend more time with his family and teach middle school language arts to students of low-income families. He continued to be a committed educator of students of all socioeconomic backgrounds until the very end of his life. Rodney Ellis leaves a legacy of dedication and commitment that saw North Carolina education through tough times. Both in the classroom and in statewide leadership, his work will benefit thousands of students for generations to come. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1407-E1408] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING RODNEY ELLIS, CHAMPION OF EDUCATION ______ HON.

CREC-2016-09-29-pt1-PgE1408-4,CREC-2016-09-29,114,INTRODUCTION OF A RESOLUTION COMMEMORATING THE OPENING OF THE SMITHSONIAN'S NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY AND CULTURE,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1408-E1409] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF A RESOLUTION COMMEMORATING THE OPENING OF THE SMITHSONIAN'S NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY AND CULTURE ______ HON. JOHN LEWIS of georgia in the house of representatives Wednesday, September 28, 2016 Mr. LEWIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer a bipartisan resolution which recognizes the opening of the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC) on Saturday, September 24, 2016. I am so proud that over 110 of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle have joined me as original cosponsors. This weekend will mark an historic moment in our Nation's history. Hundreds of thousands of people will convene in Washington, D.C. on the National Mall to celebrate and welcome this historic institution which is dedicated to documenting African American life, history, art, and culture. Many people in this body, across the nation, and around the world shall celebrate this great day. Tonight, I applaud Dr. Lonnie Bunch, III, the Founding Director, Kinshasha Holman Conwill, the Deputy Director, Cheryl Johnson, Chief of Staff, and the hundreds and thousands of people who worked so hard to make this dream a reality. For over 10 years, they have toiled day in and day out to prepare for the opening and operation of the National Museum of African American History and Culture. I know that the leadership and staff of the Museum have labored tirelessly for years and years--designing the building, raising funds, envisioning the exhibits, collecting artifacts, conducting research, and meeting with the many people across this country and around the world who are so excited about this historic moment. Mr. Speaker, I thank each and every one of them for their hard work, determination, and dedication to the National Museum of African American History and Culture. Mr. Speaker, the National Museum of African American History and Culture took over 100 years to evolve from a dream to a reality in the Nation's Capitol on the National Mall. The most recent congressional effort began with the late former Congressman Thomas ``Mickey'' Leland from Texas who revitalized the legislation in 1985. I was proud to continue his work and fought for 15 years for the bill to pass the House and Senate before finally being signed into law by President George W. Bush. It was a long, hard, labor of love, and there were so many wonderful Members on both sides of the aisle and the dome, who helped accomplish this mission, which spanned generations, decades, and movements. In 1993, the late Senator Paul Martin Simon from Illinois introduced a companion to the House legislation. Beginning in 2001, former Senator Sam Brownback from Kansas, former Senator Max Cleland from Georgia, and former Senator Chris Dodd from Connecticut joined the House coalition which included Representatives William ``Bill'' Clay from Missouri, J.C. Watts, Jr. from Oklahoma, and Jack Kingston from Georgia who helped take this bipartisan, bicameral effort across the finish line. Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I did not also thank some of the former congressional staff who worked for so many years to pass the legislation which authorized the Museum--Tammy Boyd in my office; Kerri Watson with former Rep. J.C. Watts; LaRochelle Young with former Sen. Sam Brownback: and Donni Turner with former Sen. Max Cleland. They refused to give up; they refused to give in, and we thank them for their hard work and service. On the eve of this long-awaited day, I join with more than 110 of my colleagues in congratulating Smithsonian Institution's family, the countless staff, and many volunteers of the National Museum of African American History and Culture on their persistence, their determination, and--very, very soon--on their success. Tonight, we should all be proud, and each and every one of us must take the necessary [[Page E1409]] hours, days, weeks, and months to visit, learn, explore, and reflect on the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture and all that it signifies and entails. Mr. Speaker, this is a good day; it is a great day. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1408-E1409] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF A RESOLUTION COMMEMORATING THE OPENING OF THE SMITHSONIAN'S NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY AND CULTURE ______ HON.

CREC-2016-09-29-pt1-PgE1409,CREC-2016-09-29,114,HONORING THE JUNIOR LEAGUE OF SAINT PAUL,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1409] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE JUNIOR LEAGUE OF SAINT PAUL ______ HON. BETTY McCOLLUM of minnesota in the house of representatives Wednesday, September 28, 2016 Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Junior League of Saint Paul (JLSP) as the organization marks 100 years of dedicated community service to the people of Saint Paul, Minnesota. Since 1917, the Junior League of Saint Paul has been an all-female volunteer organization committed to the work of its founder, Elizabeth Ames Jackson. For the past century, JLSP has forged coalitions and leveraged the talents and passions of volunteers to address our community's greatest challenges. After working on behalf of the Red Cross and supporting the war effort in the 1920's, JLSP found a cause of their own to champion. Realizing that there was a need in the community for women to have a place to recover peacefully from surgery, they created a Convalescent Home for Women and Girls. This allowed women to have a place out of the hospital where they might regain their strength before returning to the stresses of work and family. In 1933, the JLSP was approached by the Children's Hospital to create a needy-bed fund for children whose families could not afford medical care. The JLSP eagerly stepped in and started a city wide push for funds to support the hospital. Their success culminated in the creation of the Children's Hospital Association, which in later years has gone on to fund hospital initiatives and start-up programs. The Children's Hospital Association is still providing for the healthcare needs of children in the Saint Paul area to this day in part because of the work of the JLSP. Understanding that there were other challenges to address in the community, the JLSP shifted their focus to the development of recreational spaces for Saint Paul's youth. They partnered with the Neighborhood House and the Community Chest, which later became the United Way, to start Saint Paul Community Services. With the help of $12,000 of seed money from the JLSP, Saint Paul Community Services, now known as Keystone Community Services, is still in operation today. In the 1980's as Saint Paul welcomed an influx of Hmong refugees, the women of the Saint Paul Junior League saw a way that they may help their new neighbors. The JLSP saw the beauty and opportunity represented in the story cloths made by Hmong women. By helping to market these beautiful cloths for sale in the community, JLSP assisted in empowering their new neighbors to earn money and improve their English. In the 1990's the JLSP pivoted to the issue of domestic violence and started the Minnesota chapter of Silent Witness; an organization that helped to bring awareness and honor the memory of women killed as a result of abuse. In the new century, members of JLSP worked with Women's Advocates in Saint Paul, the nation's first battered women's shelter. They helped to make the shelter more physically comfortable, inviting, and safe for women who were seeking refuge. Over the course of a century, the JLSP has taken on daunting challenges in Saint Paul to create solutions to lift up those disadvantaged and struggling members of our community. Mr. Speaker, please join me in rising to honor the Junior League of Saint Paul on its 100th anniversary--and for the next century of service to the community. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1409] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE JUNIOR LEAGUE OF SAINT PAUL ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, it is my honor and pleasure to extend my personal congratulations and best wishes to an exceptional community leader and outstanding citizen, Mrs. Dorothy Hyatt, on the occasion of her retirement as Executive Director of Girls, Inc. of Columbus, Georgia. A Columbus native, Dorothy Hyatt starting going to Girls, Inc. at an early age and continued her attendance throughout high school. Her mother worked many hours to support Dorothy and her four siblings so Dorothy would spend much of her time at Girls, Inc. where she would do arts and crafts, learn how to cook and sew, and play in the swimming pool. Her peers and mentors at Girls, Inc. encouraged her to attend college after her graduation from Jordan High School in 1972. She received a scholarship from Girls, Inc. and earned a Bachelor's degree in Social Rehabilitation from Troy State University in 1976 and a Master's in Criminal Justice from the same university in 1980. Girls, Inc. had been such an integral part of her childhood and teenage years that it came as no surprise when Mrs. Hyatt returned to Girls, Inc. to work as Center Director of the Garrard Center in Columbus in 1976. In 1981, Mrs. Hyatt became the Executive Director of Girls, Inc. of Columbus and has served in this capacity ever since. There was no better candidate to run the organization than Mrs. Hyatt. Having been on the receiving side of the program, she knew the impact it could have on a young girl and the decisions she made during the most formative years of her life. Girls, Inc. can be the difference between a bright, successful future and a life of drugs, crime, or poverty. Mrs. Hyatt's understanding of the organization's mission on a personal level has helped to keep Girls, Inc. effective in mentoring girls and shaping them into strong, independent women. In addition to her leadership of Girls, Inc., Mrs. Hyatt has proven to be an exceptional member of her community. She has served on the Columbus South Task Force and the Columbus Coalition of Children and Youth. She served as a board member of the Downtown Kiwanis Club and the St. Francis Hospital Advisory Committee for Women's Health. In 1996, Ms. Hyatt served as President of the United Way Directors Association. She is a 1993 graduate of Leadership Columbus and a 1998 graduate of Leadership Georgia. Ms. Hyatt has been recognized numerous times for her professional and community work. She is a recipient of the Girls, Inc. Southern Regional Professional of the Year Award; the Judge Aaron Cohn Community Service Award; the Keith Bissel Volunteer Award from the Kiwanis Club; the Gracious Lady Award, the Leadership Georgia Foundation Award, and the Governor Honors Award, among many others. Dr. Benjamin E. Mays often said: ``You make your living by what you get; you make your life by what you give.'' Not only has Mrs. Hyatt made her living at Girls, Inc. by mentoring and uplifting girls beyond their circumstances, but she has also made her life by giving back to the great city of Columbus in so many ways. We are all very grateful for her tireless advocacy in making our community stronger. A woman of great integrity, her efforts, her dedication, and her expertise are unparalleled, but her heart for helping others utilizing these qualities has made her life's work truly special. Mrs. Hyatt has accomplished much in her life but none of it would be possible without the love and support of her husband, Phil; her children, Emilee and Wynn; and her grandson, Harrison. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in extending our sincerest appreciation and best wishes to Mrs. Dorothy Hyatt upon the occasion of her retirement from an outstanding career spanning four decades with Girls, Inc. of Columbus.

Her mother worked many hours to support Dorothy and her four siblings so Dorothy would spend much of her time at Girls, Inc. where she would do arts and crafts, learn how to cook and sew, and play in the swimming pool. Her peers and mentors at Girls, Inc. encouraged her to attend college after her graduation from Jordan High School in 1972. She received a scholarship from Girls, Inc. and earned a Bachelor's degree in Social Rehabilitation from Troy State University in 1976 and a Master's in Criminal Justice from the same university in 1980. Girls, Inc. had been such an integral part of her childhood and teenage years that it came as no surprise when Mrs. Hyatt returned to Girls, Inc. to work as Center Director of the Garrard Center in Columbus in 1976. In 1981, Mrs. Hyatt became the Executive Director of Girls, Inc. of Columbus and has served in this capacity ever since. There was no better candidate to run the organization than Mrs. Hyatt. Having been on the receiving side of the program, she knew the impact it could have on a young girl and the decisions she made during the most formative years of her life. Girls, Inc. can be the difference between a bright, successful future and a life of drugs, crime, or poverty. Mrs. Hyatt's understanding of the organization's mission on a personal level has helped to keep Girls, Inc. effective in mentoring girls and shaping them into strong, independent women. In addition to her leadership of Girls, Inc., Mrs. Hyatt has proven to be an exceptional member of her community. She has served on the Columbus South Task Force and the Columbus Coalition of Children and Youth. She served as a board member of the Downtown Kiwanis Club and the St. Francis Hospital Advisory Committee for Women's Health. In 1996, Ms. Hyatt served as President of the United Way Directors Association. She is a 1993 graduate of Leadership Columbus and a 1998 graduate of Leadership Georgia. Ms. Hyatt has been recognized numerous times for her professional and community work. She is a recipient of the Girls, Inc. Southern Regional Professional of the Year Award; the Judge Aaron Cohn Community Service Award; the Keith Bissel Volunteer Award from the Kiwanis Club; the Gracious Lady Award, the Leadership Georgia Foundation Award, and the Governor Honors Award, among many others. Dr. Benjamin E. Mays often said: ``You make your living by what you get; you make your life by what you give.'' Not only has Mrs. Hyatt made her living at Girls, Inc. by mentoring and uplifting girls beyond their circumstances, but she has also made her life by giving back to the great city of Columbus in so many ways. We are all very grateful for her tireless advocacy in making our community stronger. A woman of great integrity, her efforts, her dedication, and her expertise are unparalleled, but her heart for helping others utilizing these qualities has made her life's work truly special. Mrs. Hyatt has accomplished much in her life but none of it would be possible without the love and support of her husband, Phil; her children, Emilee and Wynn; and her grandson, Harrison. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in extending our sincerest appreciation and best wishes to Mrs. Dorothy Hyatt upon the occasion of her retirement from an outstanding career spanning four decades with Girls, Inc. of Columbus.

DEBBIE DINGELL of michigan in the house of representatives Wednesday, September 28, 2016 Mrs. DINGELL, Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jon Wood for his service as a member of the Congressional Award Board of Directors. The United States Congress established the Congressional Award in 1979 to recognize initiative, achievement, and service in young people. It began as a bipartisan effort in both the United States Senate and the House of Representatives. The original bill was sponsored by the late Senator Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming and the late Congressman James Howard of New Jersey. Originally signed into law by President Jimmy Carter, the legislation (Public Law 96-114) established the Congressional Award as a public-private partnership, which receives all funding from the private sector. Every president since, both Democratic and Republican, have signed legislation to continue the program. The Congressional Award Board of Directors is comprised of 48 members and supports the work of the foundation by providing mission-based leadership and strategic governance. Every member of the Board serves as a volunteer to help make the program a national opportunity available in every congressional district. During this past year, over 40,000 participants from all 50 states were actively working toward earning a Congressional Award and 5,000 new participants enrolled in the program. Since its inception, over 7 million hours of service have been contributed to communities nationwide. The example set by Jon is one we all should strive for. His willingness to serve his community and our nation's young people sets him apart as an outstanding individual, and I have been honored to serve alongside of him as Leader Pelosi's congressional appointee to the Board. I ask that all of my colleagues in the House of Representatives join me in thanking Jon for his service and wishing him nothing but continued success. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1410] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING JON WOOD ______ HON.

DAVID YOUNG of iowa in the house of representatives Wednesday, September 28, 2016 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Kurtz Hardware Company for their 150th year of business in the Des Moines metropolitan area. L.H. Kurtz, a German immigrant, founded Kurtz Hardware Company in 1866, starting what is now one of the oldest companies in the community. At first selling hardware and tin items, the store evolved through the years, adding plumbing and heating products, and later sporting goods and houseware sections. A roof collapse in 1998, along with the competition of newer and larger hardware stores opening in the area, led current fifth generation owner Bob Kurtz to refocus the business to concentrate on commercial contracting. The Des Moines Register, in an article featuring the business, asked why Kurtz Hardware Company has lasted so long and endured such difficult times as the Great Depression, World War II, the farm crisis of the 1980s, and the rise of the big box stores. Bob Kurtz answered with a laugh, ``It's just the old stubborn German in us, I guess.'' As a testament to the longevity of Kurtz Hardware Company, the Des Moines Register noted that the company supplied materials for the Equitable Building, Des Moines' first skyscraper of the time, built back in 1924. Today, they are providing doors and hardware for that same Equitable Building as it is currently being renovated into residential living. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to represent Kurtz Hardware Company in the United States Congress and I'm proud to recognize them for their 150 years of service to the Des Moines area. I ask that my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in congratulating Kurtz Hardware Company of Des Moines and in wishing them nothing but continued success. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1410] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO KURTZ HARDWARE COMPANY ______ HON.

PETER J. VISCLOSKY of indiana in the house of representatives Wednesday, September 28, 2016 Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect that I rise to remember United States Army Specialist Richard ``Dickie'' Allen Cable for his bravery and willingness to fight for his country. Specialist Cable was killed in action while defending his comrades during Operation Billings in Vietnam on June 14, 1967. It is my honor to sponsor H.R. 4887, a bill that would name the Post Office in Shelby, Indiana, after Specialist Cable, a hero who gave up his life in service of the nation he loved. A resident of Shelby, Dickie graduated from Lowell High School in 1965 and is remembered by friends as an exceptional member of the community. Dickie was an outstanding athlete who loved softball, basketball, and track and field. His friends recall that Dickie was always captain and everyone always wanted to be on his team. Dickie was adopted and an only child. Following the death of his father Fred, when Dickie was only nine, he took on a variety of jobs to help support his mother, Grace, including working as a pin setter at the local bowling alley. After high school, Dickie got a job at Inland Steel in East Chicago, Indiana. In 1966, Dickie was drafted into the United States Army and served as a rifleman assigned to B Company, 1st Battalion, 16th Infantry Regiment of the 1st Infantry Division, where he demonstrated bravery and courage. Specialist Cable and his team were on a mission when he spotted several Viet Cong in the jungle. He shouted a warning to his comrades and fired on the Viet Cong. Ignoring the heavy return fire, he engaged the enemy until his comrades reached cover. As he moved to rejoin his team, he spotted an enemy machine-gun team setting up. Realizing his fellow soldiers would be subject to vicious crossfire, Specialist Cable began a running assault toward the enemy position. Although he was wounded several times, he overran the position and killed the insurgents before he fell. He was only 20 years old. For his courage and sacrifice, Dickie was posthumously honored by the military with the Silver Star and the Purple Heart. In addition, Dickie was awarded the National Defense Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal with 2 Bronze Service Stars, the Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross Medal with Palm, the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal with 1960 Device, the Combat Infantry Badge, and the Sharpshooter Badge with Rifle Bar. Dickie was survived by his mother, Grace, and a close-knit community of neighbors and friends in Shelby, who continue to honor his memory today. I would like to thank Mr. Richard Boetler, who first approached my office about dedicating the Shelby Post Office to Dickie's memory and organized a petition to advocate for this legislation with over 700 signatures from former and current Shelby residents. Additionally, I would like to extend my appreciation to the entire Indiana delegation for joining me in this effort. Finally, I would like to thank the local elected officials in Shelby for their advocacy, including Indiana State Senator Rick Niemeyer, Indiana State Representative Michael Aylesworth, Cedar Creek Township Trustee Alice Dahl, Lake County Councilman Eldon Strong, and Lake County Commissioner Gerry Scheub. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring a fallen hero, United States Army Specialist Richard Allen Cable. Specialist Cable sacrificed his life in service to his country, and his death was a great loss to our Nation. Nearly 50 years after his passing, Specialist Cable remains a hero in the eyes of his loved ones and his Nation. Let us take this opportunity to honor the sacrifice he made to preserve the ideals of freedom and democracy. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1410] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING SPECIALIST RICHARD ALLEN CABLE ______ HON.

In 1966, Dickie was drafted into the United States Army and served as a rifleman assigned to B Company, 1st Battalion, 16th Infantry Regiment of the 1st Infantry Division, where he demonstrated bravery and courage. Specialist Cable and his team were on a mission when he spotted several Viet Cong in the jungle. He shouted a warning to his comrades and fired on the Viet Cong. Ignoring the heavy return fire, he engaged the enemy until his comrades reached cover. As he moved to rejoin his team, he spotted an enemy machine-gun team setting up. Realizing his fellow soldiers would be subject to vicious crossfire, Specialist Cable began a running assault toward the enemy position. Although he was wounded several times, he overran the position and killed the insurgents before he fell. He was only 20 years old. For his courage and sacrifice, Dickie was posthumously honored by the military with the Silver Star and the Purple Heart. In addition, Dickie was awarded the National Defense Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal with 2 Bronze Service Stars, the Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross Medal with Palm, the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal with 1960 Device, the Combat Infantry Badge, and the Sharpshooter Badge with Rifle Bar. Dickie was survived by his mother, Grace, and a close-knit community of neighbors and friends in Shelby, who continue to honor his memory today. I would like to thank Mr. Richard Boetler, who first approached my office about dedicating the Shelby Post Office to Dickie's memory and organized a petition to advocate for this legislation with over 700 signatures from former and current Shelby residents. Additionally, I would like to extend my appreciation to the entire Indiana delegation for joining me in this effort. Finally, I would like to thank the local elected officials in Shelby for their advocacy, including Indiana State Senator Rick Niemeyer, Indiana State Representative Michael Aylesworth, Cedar Creek Township Trustee Alice Dahl, Lake County Councilman Eldon Strong, and Lake County Commissioner Gerry Scheub. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring a fallen hero, United States Army Specialist Richard Allen Cable. Specialist Cable sacrificed his life in service to his country, and his death was a great loss to our Nation. Nearly 50 years after his passing, Specialist Cable remains a hero in the eyes of his loved ones and his Nation. Let us take this opportunity to honor the sacrifice he made to preserve the ideals of freedom and democracy. ____________________",package_114_206.csv,4074,4074,4148,"[congressional record volume 162, number 148 (thursday, september 29, 2016)] [extensions of remarks] [page e1410] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] honoring specialist richard allen cable ______ hon. peter j. visclosky of indiana in the house of representatives wednesday, september 28, 2016 mr. visclosky. mr. speaker, it is with great respect that i rise to remember united states army specialist richard ``dickie'' allen cable for his bravery and willingness to fight for his country. specialist cable was killed in action while defending his comrades during operation billings in vietnam on june 14, 1967. it is my honor to sponsor h.r. 4887, a bill that would name the post office in shelby, indiana, after specialist cable, a hero who gave up his life in service of the nation he loved. a resident of shelby, dickie graduated from lowell high school in 1965 and is remembered by friends as an exceptional member of the community. dickie was an outstanding athlete who loved softball, basketball, and track and field. his friends recall that dickie was always captain and everyone always wanted to be on his team. dickie was adopted and an only child. following the death of his father fred, when dickie was only nine, he took on a variety of jobs to help support his mother, grace, including working as a pin setter at the local bowling alley. after high school, dickie got a job at inland steel in east chicago, indiana. in 1966, dickie was drafted into the united states army and served as a rifleman assigned to b company, 1st battalion, 16th infantry regiment of the 1st infantry division, where he demonstrated bravery and courage. specialist cable and his team were on a mission when he spotted several viet cong in the jungle. he shouted a warning to his comrades and fired on the viet cong. ignoring the heavy return fire, he engaged the enemy until his comrades reached cover. as he moved to rejoin his team, he spotted an enemy machine-gun team setting up. realizing his fellow soldiers would be subject to vicious crossfire, specialist cable began a running assault toward the enemy position. although he was wounded several times, he overran the position and killed the insurgents before he fell. he was only 20 years old. for his courage and sacrifice, dickie was posthumously honored by the military with the silver star and the purple heart. in addition, dickie was awarded the national defense service medal, the vietnam service medal with 2 bronze service stars, the republic of vietnam gallantry cross medal with palm, the republic of vietnam campaign medal with 1960 device, the combat infantry badge, and the sharpshooter badge with rifle bar. dickie was survived by his mother, grace, and a close-knit community of neighbors and friends in shelby, who continue to honor his memory today. i would like to thank mr. richard boetler, who first approached my office about dedicating the shelby post office to dickie's memory and organized a petition to advocate for this legislation with over 700 signatures from former and current shelby residents. additionally, i would like to extend my appreciation to the entire indiana delegation for joining me in this effort. finally, i would like to thank the local elected officials in shelby for their advocacy, including indiana state senator rick niemeyer, indiana state representative michael aylesworth, cedar creek township trustee alice dahl, lake county councilman eldon strong, and lake county commissioner gerry scheub. mr. speaker, at this time, i ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring a fallen hero, united states army specialist richard allen cable. specialist cable sacrificed his life in service to his country, and his death was a great loss to our nation. nearly 50 years after his passing, specialist cable remains a hero in the eyes of his loved ones and his nation. let us take this opportunity to honor the sacrifice he made to preserve the ideals of freedom and democracy. ____________________",4074

RAMEY,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1410-E1411] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO DAVID K. RAMEY ______ HON. KEN CALVERT of california in the house of representatives Wednesday, September 28, 2016 Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, the House of Representatives is, in my opinion, the greatest legislative body in the history of the world. A large portion of the credit for that is due to the thousands of staff members who dedicate the better part of their adult lives to working within the halls of this democratic institution. For the past 24 years, I have been incredibly fortunate to have benefitted from the talented services of David Kirk Ramey. Dave's tenure in the House dates back to before I was elected (when the Cold War existed and the Internet didn't), when he worked for my good friend and mentor, former Congressman Jerry Lewis (R-CA). Dave served Rep. Lewis from February 1985 through December 1992 as a Foreign Policy and Defense Analyst in the House Republican Conference, Policy Committee, and Research Committee. Months after being hired by Lewis, Dave welcomed to the Research Committee staff his good friend Flint Lewis (no relation to the Congressman). Alongside Jack Pitney, Guy Hicks, Kelly Cook Marcavage, Brenda Benjamin Reese, Todd Hauptli, Jim O'Malley, Frank [[Page E1411]] Gregorsky, Paul Ritacco, Lee Raudonis, Ed Slevin and others, Dave served for eight years in the House Republican Leadership. According to former Staff Director Bob Okun, who hired Dave and under whom Dave worked during most of those years, Dave ``. . . distinguished himself as a top notch researcher and writer on Capitol Hill in the 1980s which served him so well through his thirty plus years on the Hill.'' Dave wrote for the 1988 Republican Platform Committee which was co-chaired by Rep. Lewis. Congressman Lewis told me that he has ``. . . always been very proud of the quality of our personal staff. One of the greatest among them has been David Ramey. To our knowledge, the only mistake Dave ever made was to leave our staff and to go and work for my buddy Ken Calvert.'' After I was first elected in November of 1992, Dave was one of the first staff members I brought on board as my Legislative Director. My first Chief of Staff, Ed Slevin, said ``Without a doubt, Dave is one of the best and the brightest. He was a great renaissance man for the Congressman.'' In 1997, Dave became my Chief of Staff when Ed left the Hill. Throughout his time in my office, Dave has demonstrated a tremendous gift for analyzing policies and finding solutions to complex legislative challenges. Many things have changed over Dave's 32 years in the House, but his sense of punctuality and neatness were always a constant. He has also mentored a great number of staff members and interns who have served in my office, sharing with them the tremendous knowledge he possesses about our government, Capitol Hill, history and life in general. I believe it's fair to say nobody who spent time working in our office left without bearing the imprint of Dave's wonderful leadership. Some of the staff's favorite Daveisms include: ``Ounce for ounce, testosterone is more dangerous than plutonium,'' ``If you want one thing, ask for two,'' ``cc's are free,'' ``What gets scheduled, gets done,'' ``A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds,'' ``Don't go to law school,'' and the all-time favorite, ``The six most important words in the English language are: `I am sorry. I was wrong.' '' In addition to working in my office, Dave has served as the CRAP Master, the head of the California Republican Administrative Personnel group (CRAPs), as well as Co-Chairman of the bipartisan California State Society. He graduated from the College of William and Mary in 1984 with a B.A. in International Relations and in 2010 received his Master of Arts with Highest Distinction from the Naval War College in National Security and Strategic Studies. When Dave steps down on October 31st to become a principal at Kadesh and Associates, it will mark the departure of the last staff member in my office who has served me since I was sworn into office in 1993. (The amount of file space that we will reclaim is practically unfathomable.) Dave's immeasurable contributions to my office, the constituents I have represented in Riverside and Orange Counties, and to our country are something for which we should all be very grateful. Personally, I have and will continue to value my friendship with Dave and wish him and his wife Jenny, their daughter Maddie and son Ben the very best and brightest future. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1410-E1411] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO DAVID K.

JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY of illinois in the house of representatives Wednesday, September 28, 2016 Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the month of September as Dystonia Awareness Month. Currently, it is estimated that at least 300,000 individuals in North America suffer from dystonia, making it more common than Huntington's, muscular dystrophy, and ALS. Dystonia may be inherited or caused by specific factors such as trauma, certain medications, and additional medical conditions. For most people with dystonia, the cause remains unknown and there is currently no cure. Dystonia is a neurological movement disorder that causes muscles to contract and spasm involuntarily. It affects men, women, and children. Dystonia can be generalized, affecting all major muscle groups, and resulting in twisting, repetitive movements and abnormal postures. It can also be focal, affecting a specific part of the body such as legs, arms, hands, neck, face, mouth, eyelids, or vocal cords. Dystonia is not usually fatal, but it is a chronic disorder producing symptoms that vary in degrees of frequency, intensity, disability, and pain depending on the type of dystonia. The inability to predict or control the movements of the legs, arms, hands, neck, shoulders, face, eyelids, jaw, tongue, and/or vocal cords has a profound impact on an individual's life. Medical literature associates the onset of dystonia with traumatic injury, particularly traumatic head/brain injuries. Our men and women in uniform face a disproportionate risk of developing dystonia as a result of an injury sustained during their military service. The Dystonia Medical Research Foundation, which works to raise awareness of dystonia is a nationwide organization that serves the community. Beyond awareness, the Dystonia Medical Research Foundation provides the dystonia community with support, education, advocacy, and the promotion of research into the causes of and care of dystonia. I have long known the Farber family and have seen their contributions and passion for the support of dystonia related research and awareness. I call on my colleagues to recognize the goals and ideals of Dystonia Awareness Month by supporting federal activities that improve lives of patients impacted by dystonia including research programs at the National Institutes of Health. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1411] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DYSTONIA AWARENESS MONTH ______ HON.

DORIS O. MATSUI of california in the house of representatives Wednesday, September 28, 2016 Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the career of Mr. Jerry Way as the Director of Public Works for the City of Sacramento. As his family, friends, and colleagues gather to celebrate his many professional accomplishments, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating this exceptional individual whose 36 years of service have greatly benefited the City of Sacramento. A graduate from California State University, Sacramento, Jerry began his career in Public Works in 1980. As the City Traffic Engineer and Streets Manager, Jerry led projects that greatly improved the infrastructure of the State Capital. He was appointed Sacramento's Director of Public Works in 2006. He managed over 400 employees and a $100 million capital improvement budget, overseeing projects that greatly enhanced public safety, raised the quality of life of my constituents, and promoted environmental sustainability. His oversight also included the operations and maintenance of more than 3,000 road lane miles, 40,000 streetlights, and 10,000 parking spaces. Jerry is well known throughout Sacramento for his ability to get things done in City Hall. In recent years, he took on some of the region's largest and most important projects, including the new downtown arena, the Downtown Sacramento Streetcar, and the Delta Shores and Railyards developments. His steady leadership, his sense of humor, and his perspective over the last decade have been instrumental in changing Sacramento for the better. Because of his dedication to serving the public, Jerry was named as one of the Top 10 Public Works Leaders in North America by the American Public Works Association. Jerry served on the Board of Directors for the Sacramento Tree Foundation and for the River District; he also promoted environmental awareness in the Sacramento community through his many sustainability projects. Jerry's extraordinary commitment to raising the quality of life for the citizens of Sacramento has helped make the state capital a wonderful place to live, work, and raise a family.

DEBBIE DINGELL of michigan in the house of representatives Wednesday, September 28, 2016 Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Paul Kelly for his service as a member of the Congressional Award Board of Directors. The United States Congress established the Congressional Award in 1979 to recognize initiative, achievement, and service in young people. It began as a bipartisan effort in both the United States Senate and the House of Representatives. The original bill was sponsored by the late Senator Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming and the late Congressman James Howard of New Jersey. Originally signed into law by President Jimmy Carter, the legislation (Public Law 96-114) established the Congressional Award as a public-private partnership, which receives all funding from the private sector. Every president since, both Democratic and Republican, have signed legislation to continue the program. The Congressional Award Board of Directors is comprised of 48 members and supports the work of the foundation by providing mission-based leadership and strategic governance. Every member of the Board serves as a volunteer to help make the program a national opportunity available in every congressional district. During this past year, over 40,000 participants from all 50 states were actively working toward earning a Congressional Award and 5,000 new participants enrolled in the program. Since its inception, over 7 million hours of service have been contributed to communities nationwide. The example set by Paul is one we all should strive for. His willingness to serve his community and our nation's young people sets him apart as an outstanding individual, and I have been honored to serve alongside of him as Leader Pelosi's congressional appointee to the Board. I ask that all of my colleagues in the House of Representatives join me in thanking Paul for his service and wishing him nothing but continued success. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1412] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING PAUL KELLY ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Paul Kelly for his service as a member of the Congressional Award Board of Directors. The United States Congress established the Congressional Award in 1979 to recognize initiative, achievement, and service in young people. It began as a bipartisan effort in both the United States Senate and the House of Representatives. The original bill was sponsored by the late Senator Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming and the late Congressman James Howard of New Jersey. Originally signed into law by President Jimmy Carter, the legislation (Public Law 96-114) established the Congressional Award as a public-private partnership, which receives all funding from the private sector.

Mr. Speaker, on Saturday, October 22, 2016, veteran soldiers of the Army's 65th Infantry Regiment, known as the Borinqueneers, will be recognized with replica Congressional Gold Medals in a ceremony organized by local businesses and by the Borinqueneer Congressional Gold Medal National Committee. Residents, families and military veterans will gather in Orlando, Florida to honor these American heroes. Created by Congress in 1898 as an all-Puerto Rican military unit, the 65th Infantry Regiment was called upon to serve in World War I, World War II, and especially the Korean War, where they became known as ``the Borinqueneers''. During the darkest days of the Korean War, the 65th Infantry Regiment fought some of the fiercest battles under some of the harshest conditions; and they did so as the military's last segregated unit--a true testimony to their character. It was at the now-famous Battle of the Chosin Reservoir, one of the greatest strategic withdrawals in modern military history, that the 65th Infantry Regiment fearlessly provided cover for the 1st Marine Division. The Borinqueneers are also recorded to be the last in U.S. Army history to conduct a battalion-sized bayonet charge. For their extraordinary service in the Korean War, the Regiment earned a Medal of Honor, 9 Distinguished Service Crosses, approximately 250 Silver Stars, over 600 Bronze Stars, and more than 2,700 Purple Hearts. The Borinqueneers now join the ranks of the most intrepid American warriors who have received the Congressional Gold Medal. Awarding the 65th Infantry Regiment with the Congressional Gold Medal is an opportunity for our nation to honor the sacrifices, and recognize the prejudices and injustices endured by these American heroes. It is fitting we celebrate our beloved Borinqueneers on the heels of Hispanic Heritage month. The freedom we all enjoy today exists because of their courage, and their service to our nation.

He worked as the General Sessions Judge and District Attorney for the 14th Judicial District. He was also elected as the Maury [[Page E1413]] County Executive in 1992. Sam served as a member of the Tennessee State School Board and the Law Revision Commission. The main focus of Sam Kennedy's career is journalism. Kennedy was the editor and publisher of the Columbia Daily Herald and a leader in the Tennessee Press Association. He served as the president and chaired its Government Affairs Committee for 30 years. He also served as a director for the Southern Newspaper Publishers Association. Sam Kennedy has shaped much of what journalism is today. He has been an advocate for the First Amendment and took the lead to help pass the Tennessee Sunshine law. This law passed in 1974. It requires meetings of state, city and county government bodies to be open to the public and that any such governmental body must give adequate notice before the meeting. Through his influence, he fought to keep government as transparent as possible. The Open Government Hall of Fame is a joint initiative of the National Freedom of Information Coalition (NFOIC) and the Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ). Inductees are recognized for their ``long and steady effort to preserve and protect the free flow of information about state and local government that is vital to the public in a democracy.

Through his renowned musical ability, innovative spirit, and enthusiasm for teaching, Don has brought joy to the people of the Bay Area and beyond. Don began playing the piano as a high school student in Dayton, Ohio. As a student at the Tuskegee Institute, he sang with the Tuskegee Chorus and performed at freedom rallies led by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Don became a pioneer in music technology by inventing the Live Electronic Orchestra, a synthesizer system that influenced the development of synthesizers and sounds modules for decades to come. He has performed at concerts worldwide and worked with many musical greats, such as the Newport Jazz Festival, Quincy Jones, Michael Jackson, and the Beach Boys. In addition to his professional accomplishments, Don is a passionate teacher and an involved member of our community. For nearly thirty years, his ``Say Yes to Music!'' school assemblies have motivated thousands of children across the United States and Canada to pursue their creative interests. He has engaged with Bay Area students at all levels to encourage their musical and artistic pursuits, organizing events where they can learn from each other and showcase their talents to the public. Don also actively participates in service projects as a member of the Rotary Club of Pleasanton. Don's career is truly a testament to the power of music to inspire and bring joy to others. This week, Alameda County honors his outstanding achievements and contributions to our community. I want to congratulate Don on this tremendous honor. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1413] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF DON LEWIS ______ HON.

TED POE of texas in the house of representatives Wednesday, September 28, 2016 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, as a former prosecutor and county Judge, I am very concerned by the press conference held on July 15th the Director of the FBI, James Comey. The press conference was carried live on many news channels, and Director Comey spoke in great detail (over 2,300 words), regarding procedures in her use of a personal email server while working as Secretary of State. During this press conference, Director Comey stated: ``Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.'' Not only did this press conference likely violate FBI procedure, such a public accounting of alleged misdeeds while not recommending charges made it nearly impossible for the Department of Justice to do their job in this case. The FBI is an investigating agency, not a prosecuting agency or a judge and jury. Such a public determination of a case is unprecedented and highly prejudicial. The FBI should investigate and research the facts; determining whether or not those facts constitute a crime is not their job. It appears that Comey's statement was a violation of internal DOJ procedures. Per DOJ regulations, in federal cases, the prosecutor's decision to bring criminal charges is governed by the United States Attorney's Manual. USAM 9-27.000, titled ``Principles of Federal Prosecution'' contains the DOJ's written guidance to prosecutors about decisions to initiate or decline prosecution. Specifically, 9-27.220(A) instructs prosecutors to file criminal charges in all cases where there is a violation of federal law and the evidence is sufficient to obtain a conviction, unless one of three grounds exist: Lack of a substantial federal interest; The defendant is subject to prosecution in another jurisdiction; or The existence of adequate non-criminal alternatives to prosecution. It is not clear from the Comey statement which of these exceptions he thinks applies in this case. Regardless, the determination of whether or not to pursue charges in the case does not reside with an investigative agency like the FBI. By publicly making this statement, Director Comey made it practically impossible for DOJ to fully fulfill their duties under 27.220(A). There is no provision or practice that permits the FBI (or any other federal law enforcement agency) to make recommendations to the prosecution in such a public manner. This statement violated practice and procedure and further shows that this investigation was flawed from the beginning. Secretary Clinton received different treatment than any rank and file employee at the State Department would have received in such an instance. A rank and file employee would have, at the very least, lost their security clearance had they engaged in conduct similar to that of Secretary Clinton. In the FBI ``Manual of Investigative Operations and Guidelines'' section 1-2, a number of policies and procedures are laid out for how the FBI should behave and conduct criminal investigations. Specifically, section 1-2 (1) states: ``The FBI is charged with the duty of investigating violations of the laws of the United States and collective evidence in cases in which the United States is or may be a party in interest''. In addition, section 1-2 (3) states: ``Results of investigations are furnished to United States Attorneys and/or Department of Justice.'' There is not a section in this manual that permits or directs the FBI to publicly state that the facts they investigated were not sufficient to warrant prosecution; in fact the manual clearly indicates that these facts should be turned over to either a US Attorney or the DOJ when there is sufficient evidence that a crime occurred. Director Conley stated that ``there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information''. Despite this finding, Director Comey appears to have veered from FBI procedures to make a public statement that no prosecution was warranted. It is unclear what legal standard was used to make this determination and appears to be far outside what is permitted under the policies and practice of the FBI. There was a time when the FBI was known as ``The Untouchables'' because they were above politics; those days are over. And that's just the way it is. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1413] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] UNTOUCHABLE NO MORE ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Officers Angel Padilla and Peter Hammer of the Linden Police Department in Linden, New Jersey for their role in the apprehension of the New Jersey-New York bombing suspect. Just days after we observed the 15th anniversary of the September 11th terrorist attacks, multiple bombs were planted in New York City and in Seaside Park and Elizabeth, New Jersey. On Monday, September 19, 2016, local law enforcement in my district apprehended the bombing suspect, Ahmad Khan Rahami, but not before a shootout injured two brave police officers, Angel Padilla and Peter Hammer. That day, Padilla and Hammer were among officers who responded to a call of a man sleeping in the entrance of a tavern in Linden. As he approached Rahami, whom he recognized as the bombing suspect, Padilla was shot in the torso. Fortunately, Padilla was wearing his bulletproof vest when he was struck. [[Page E1414]] During the shootout, Hammer, a 22-year veteran of the department, was hit in the head by bullet shrapnel. Thankfully, both officers are expected to make full recoveries. It is undeniable that Officers Padilla and Hammer, as well as the other officers involved in the apprehension of Rahami, are heroes. They pursued the suspect not knowing whether he was armed or worse, putting themselves in harm's way to protect their community. Thanks to their outstanding work, Rahami was apprehended, our community was kept safe, and no lives were lost.

Jackson, a brilliant young man who tragically passed away on September 11, 2016, in an automobile accident in Croton-on-Hudson, New York. Brandon was born on April 17, 1996 in Flushing, Queens. He was a proud ``A'' student graduate of Holy Cross High School in Flushing and was an exceptional member of the U.S. Military Academy Prep School Class of 2015. This bright young man was a proud member of West Point's Military Class of 2019, E Company, Second Regiment. His mother, Morna Davis, a veteran of the Iraq War, a member of the U.S. Army Reserves and a New York City Police Department Detective, inspired Cadet Jackson to commit his life to service to our country. Brandon loved Army football from a young age and, beginning in his freshman year, earned a spot as a starting member of the Army football team in the position of corner back. Brandon excelled in his role as a defensive lineman, attained impressive stats, and played a key role in the team's victory over Rice University on Saturday, September 10. Brandon was equally driven academically and was an exemplary student as a Management major in the Department of Behavioral Sciences and Leadership. He was a member of West Point's Cultural Affairs Club and, in his free time, enjoyed playing chess and basketball. Brandon is fondly remembered by all who knew him for his warm smile, engaging manner and quiet grace. He loved to help others, was a mentor to younger players and treasured his family, especially his mother. His short life was one of achievement and excellence and this proud member of the Long Gray Line exemplified the watch words of West Point--Duty, Honor, Country. There is no way to measure our loss of this incredible young man with such great promise who was dedicated to a life of service to our great nation and its citizens. I offer my deepest condolences to his family. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1414] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE OF CADET BRANDON T.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Patrick McLain for his service as a member of the Congressional Award Board of Directors. The United States Congress established the Congressional Award in 1979 to recognize initiative, achievement, and service in young people. It began as a bipartisan effort in both the United States Senate and the House of Representatives. The original bill was sponsored by the late Senator Malcolm Wallop of [[Page E1415]] Wyoming and the late Congressman James Howard of New Jersey. Originally signed into law by President Jimmy Carter, the legislation (Public Law 96-114) established the Congressional Award as a public-private partnership, which receives all funding from the private sector. Every president since, both Democratic and Republican, have signed legislation to continue the program. The Congressional Award Board of Directors is comprised of 48 members and supports the work of the foundation by providing mission-based leadership and strategic governance. Every member of the Board serves as a volunteer to help make the program a national opportunity available in every congressional district. During this past year, over 40,000 participants from all 50 states were actively working toward earning a Congressional Award and 5,000 new participants enrolled in the program. Since its inception, over 7 million hours of service have been contributed to communities nationwide. The example set by Patrick is one we all should strive for. His willingness to serve his community and our nation's young people sets him apart as an outstanding individual, and I have been honored to serve alongside of him as Leader Pelosi's congressional appointee to the Board. I ask that all of my colleagues in the House of Representatives join me in thanking Patrick for his service and wishing him nothing but continued success. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1414-E1415] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING PATRICK McLAIN ______ HON.

Every member of the Board serves as a volunteer to help make the program a national opportunity available in every congressional district. During this past year, over 40,000 participants from all 50 states were actively working toward earning a Congressional Award and 5,000 new participants enrolled in the program. Since its inception, over 7 million hours of service have been contributed to communities nationwide. The example set by Patrick is one we all should strive for.

STEPHEN KNIGHT of california in the house of representatives Wednesday, September 28, 2016 Mr. KNIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate and honor the 70th anniversary of NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center, which was founded on September 30, 1946. In 1946 a group of officials from NASA's predecessor organization, the NACA, set up an operations base for our nation's effort in the race to achieve supersonic manned flight. A year later, on October 14, 1947, Air Force Captain Chuck Yeager became the first pilot to break the sound barrier in the experimental Bell X-1 aircraft. This achievement, one of many incredible ``firsts'' in our history, inaugurated a national legacy of excellence in aerospace that defines American power today. More X-planes followed the X-1, each building on our understanding of flight and projecting U.S. power further into air and space. Twenty years after Yeager, my father, Pete Knight, flew the X-15 at Mach 6.7. Even today that flight holds the world record for aircraft speed. What we learned from the X-programs was critical to our journey to the moon and paved the way for the Space Shuttle. Today NASA Armstrong continues to play an important role in the advancement of American aeronautics. It is pursuing a new generation of X-planes that will validate technology for faster, cleaner, quieter, and safer air travel over the next ten years. These bold programs are not only an exciting next step for our nation's legacy in aviation pioneering, but a necessary one, to renew our technological and competitive edge in aviation for the 21st Century. I congratulate the men and women of NASA Armstrong on their outstanding achievements over the past 70 years. Their unfailing pursuit of useful knowledge in atmospheric flight and airborne science is essential to the American scientific enterprise, as well as our engagement with international science community, the competitiveness of our private sector air and space companies, and our military's edge over potential adversaries. On behalf of the 25th Congressional District of California, I would again like to thank the NASA Armstrong team for all they do for our country. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1415] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CELEBRATING 70 YEARS OF FLIGHT RESEARCH AT NASA ARMSTRONG ______ HON.

NYDIA M. VELAZQUEZ of new york in the house of representatives Wednesday, September 28, 2016 Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to UPROSE, a pillar of social justice organizing in New York City and Brooklyn's oldest Puerto Rican/Latino community based organization. This year, UPROSE will celebrate five decades of fighting for progress and advancing the rights of New York's working families and people of color. UPROSE was founded during the civil rights movement and has made significant strides over the last five decades. The organization has helped prevent polluting power plants from being located in lower income neighborhoods. It has impacted transportation policy, improving transit options for hardworking Brooklyn communities. The organization has made fighting climate change a centerpiece of its agenda. Indeed, it has sent three young people of color to Antarctica and one to the North Pole on scientific expeditions, to observe these environmental issues firsthand. Likewise, UPROSE has been at the forefront of ensuring that our local industrial sector continues to blossom, while providing good paying, union jobs for local residents in the community. Centered near Brooklyn's Sunset Park, UPROSE has always stood for this neighborhood's diversity. With a thriving immigrant population and more affordable housing than many parts of Brooklyn, Sunset Park attracts new waves of working people every year. UPROSE has stood with them for generations, empowering these New Yorkers to improve and strengthen the neighborhood, borough and City that they call home. Mr. Speaker, after five decades UPROSE remains an anchor in our community, fighting for justice and improving our community locally. I would ask all my colleagues to join me on their fifty years of progress and wish them the best for many more years of achievement and success. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1416] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING UPROSE ON THEIR 50TH ANNIVERSARY ______ HON.

This year, UPROSE will celebrate five decades of fighting for progress and advancing the rights of New York's working families and people of color. UPROSE was founded during the civil rights movement and has made significant strides over the last five decades. The organization has helped prevent polluting power plants from being located in lower income neighborhoods. It has impacted transportation policy, improving transit options for hardworking Brooklyn communities. The organization has made fighting climate change a centerpiece of its agenda. Indeed, it has sent three young people of color to Antarctica and one to the North Pole on scientific expeditions, to observe these environmental issues firsthand. Likewise, UPROSE has been at the forefront of ensuring that our local industrial sector continues to blossom, while providing good paying, union jobs for local residents in the community. Centered near Brooklyn's Sunset Park, UPROSE has always stood for this neighborhood's diversity. With a thriving immigrant population and more affordable housing than many parts of Brooklyn, Sunset Park attracts new waves of working people every year. UPROSE has stood with them for generations, empowering these New Yorkers to improve and strengthen the neighborhood, borough and City that they call home. Mr. Speaker, after five decades UPROSE remains an anchor in our community, fighting for justice and improving our community locally. I would ask all my colleagues to join me on their fifty years of progress and wish them the best for many more years of achievement and success. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1416] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING UPROSE ON THEIR 50TH ANNIVERSARY ______ HON.

SUSAN W. BROOKS of indiana in the house of representatives Wednesday, September 28, 2016 Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate educator Kevin Cline of Frankton Junior Senior High School, the winner of the 2016 National History Teacher of the Year Award given by the Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History. It is well-deserved. Kevin teaches United States History, American Government, World History, and several AP history courses at Frankton Junior Senior High School located in the town of Frankton in Madison County, Indiana. When asked why he loves teaching history he said ``it's got the best heroes and the best villains''. That quote shows the fun he brings to his role. I have been honored to be able to speak with Kevin and his students not only in his classroom but also in the Indiana State House where students had the opportunity to learn about the law making process at the state level. These students even had the chance to present their bill ideas to state legislators. I have seen firsthand his passion for teaching, history, and his students. Despite the hard work he has put in to achieve this honor, Kevin says that winning this award does not match the privilege he has of getting to work with his students every day. His dedication to his students and his innovation in the classroom are a gift to his students and our Hoosier community. Kevin is also an innovator by integrating technology into the classroom. He believes technology is the best way to connect classroom content to individual students. I would like to share one of many examples of him going above and beyond in his job and incorporating innovation. Kevin worked with Indiana University's Center on Congress to develop the app ``Freedom Summer.'' The app teaches students the relationship between the Civil [[Page E1416]] Rights Movement and the passage of civil rights legislation in Congress in a game-based, interactive learning environment. Continuing to innovate and make history relevant to today's students will ensure our next generation can prepare for our future challenges by learning from the past. Kevin continually engages with my office to educate his students which inspires his students to become more active citizens of the United States. In 2013, I had the honor of meeting with Kevin in D.C. to congratulate him on his 2012 American Civic Education Teacher Award. I am proud once again to congratulate Kevin on his 2016 National History Teacher of the Year award. On behalf of all Hoosiers, I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to Kevin for his contributions to our schools, history education, and most importantly to our students. As the daughter, sister and mom of teachers, I know the difficult, yet rewarding, job he has. The very best teachers have a deep passion for their subject matter, devoting themselves to not only sharing wisdom but igniting enthusiasm and excitement in their pupils. In a time when there is concern for declining civic engagement Kevin Cline is guiding the next generation of Indiana students to be knowledgeable, passionate, and engaged members of their community and the United States. Congratulations Kevin, your award is well-deserved. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1415-E1416] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CELEBRATING KEVIN CLINE AND HIS NATIONAL AWARD FOR EXCELLENCE IN TEACHING HISTORY ______ HON.

EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of texas in the house of representatives Wednesday, September 28, 2016 Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of the Safe Communities America program and the inaugural Safe Communities America Day, which will take place in Dallas on October 5th. Safe Communities America is a program of the National Safety Council which recognizes communities that prioritize safety and take deliberate steps to improve the health and safety of its citizens. I am proud to say that the first Safe Communities Day will be celebrated in Dallas, which was the first U.S. city--and first urban city worldwide--to be accredited as an International Safe Community. In fact, the City of Dallas has proudly retained its accreditation since 1996. The City of Dallas and its local partners have worked tremendously hard to improve the safety and security of our communities in Texas. For over 20 years, the City of Dallas has been implementing Operation Installation, a residential fire safety program. The Injury Prevention Center of Greater Dallas has teamed up with the Dallas Fire Rescue Department to go door-to-door, installing smoke alarms at homes in neighborhoods most impacted by fire-related deaths, resulting in a 74 percent decrease in fire deaths. Since its inception, this partnership has installed more than 30,000 smoke alarms, covering 42,000 residents. More recently, Dallas Safe Communities has implemented PHOTOVOICE, a project that teaches middle school students how to use a camera and photographs to improve pedestrian safety in the Vickery Meadow area. Students are getting involved in their communities by taking photographs of broken sidewalks, absent sidewalks, damaged pedestrian signals and share their ``story'' with city officials to advocate for improved safety. Our neighboring City of Fort Worth has also been an accredited Safe Community since 2013. A variety of services are being offered around the city in order to have a comprehensive approach to fall prevention, including free home safety evaluations to seniors via the local fire department, education to first-responders on home safety hazard recognition, Matter of Balance classes, an evidence based-approach to falls prevention, offered to older adults through multiple community partners, STEADI (fall screening and intervention) training for local physicians and medication management via pharmacists and Meals on Wheels. With one of the fastest growing elder populations in Texas, the Ft. Worth coalition is committed to keeping older adults injury free. Mr. Speaker, I am proud that the Cities of Dallas and Fort Worth, in conjunction with local organizations, are taking the lead to promote safety within our communities. I would also like to reiterate my support for the Safe Communities America program, which has proven to be a tremendous initiative led by the National Safety Council. This program has helped to create safer environments in our neighborhoods while engaging local citizens and encouraging individuals of all ages to become active members of their communities. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1416] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE SAFE COMMUNITIES AMERICA PROGRAM AND THE INAUGURAL SAFE COMMUNITIES AMERICA DAY IN DALLAS ______ HON.

ELLIS ______ HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. of georgia in the house of representatives Wednesday, September 28, 2016 Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today to pay tribute to a dedicated public servant and outstanding citizen, Jacqueline A. Ellis. Sadly, [[Page E1417]] Jacqui passed away last week. A memorial service will be held on Friday, September 30, 2016 at Reid Temple A.M.E. Church in Glenn Dale, Maryland. The homegoing service will be held on Saturday, October 8, 2016 at Union Missionary Baptist Church in Mobile, Alabama. Jacqueline A. Ellis came into this world on October 22, 1957 in Mobile, Alabama. Growing up during the tumultuous times of the Civil Rights Movement, Jacqui spent her life and career working to advance the interests of African Americans and women. Jacqui worked on Capitol Hill for nearly three decades, and her list of accomplishments and successes reflects her dedication to public service and the citizens she served. Jacqui attended Jarvis Christian College from 1976 to 1980. Later on in life, Jacqui was inducted into the Jarvis Christian College's Pioneers Hall of Fame. This honor highlighted her contributions to the school, and the positive recognition her career and successes brought to Jarvis Christian College. Her contributions to generations of students did not end there, however, as she also was a guest lecturer at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University as well as a Co-Chair of the Bethune-DuBois Institute, Inc. Leadership Forum. The Bethune-DuBois Institute, named after two prominent African American educators, Mary McLeod Bethune and Dr. W.E.B. DuBois, strives to advance the interests and opportunities of African Americans through education and leadership development. Jacqui was a former National Board Member of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), a civil rights group founded in response to the Montgomery Bus Boycott of 1955. The SCLC is now a national organization focused on fighting for human rights around the world. The SCLC honored Jacqui with the Ella Baker Award.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life of Gold Star Mother and Laredoan Mrs. Francisca Martinez. Mrs. Martinez was born September 3, 1911, in Linares, Nuevo Leon, Mexico, to parents Jesus Jasso and Francisca Trevino Jasso. She immigrated to the United States when she was fourteen years old. Her family settled in Laredo, Texas, and she soon became a United States citizen. Mrs. Martinez later met Enrique Martinez who would become her husband in 1929. Francisca was a proud mother of eight children, Estanislado, Guadalupe, Petra, Maria Antonietta, Enrique, Jesus, Antonio, and Maria Aurora. Five of her sons served in the United States Army. Her oldest son, Estanislado Martinez, was wounded in the Korean War and her second eldest, Sgt. First Class Guadalupe Martinez, a Green Beret, was killed in action during the Vietnam War. It is because of her son's brave service and sacrifice that she became a member of the American Gold Star Mothers Organization. Francisca was affectionately called ``Panchita'' by those close to her, who remember her passion and commitment to serving the community. She instilled a sense of service and charity in all her children. Francisca spent her life caring for others, continuing to volunteer at the local food bank on a weekly basis even into her later years. Mrs. Martinez is survived by her sons, Jesus and Antonio Martinez; her daughters, Petra Hill and Maria Aurora Gutierrez; numerous grandchildren and great-grandchildren; and countless friends. Her legacy will live on in Laredo and she will be remembered for the countless lives that she touched in our community.

Ernie has been a licensed pilot since September 15, 1942. For the past 74 years, local friends have known that, if you cannot find Ernie nearby, he is probably up in the sky. In January 2016, Red Oak Airport Manager Kevin McGrew and other community leaders nominated him for the distinction of ``oldest active pilot in the world.'' Later this spring, they videotaped a flight to authenticate his activity in the air. The official pronouncement from the Oiliness Book of World Records came recently, confirming that Ernie Smith, 98, is officially ``the oldest active pilot in the world,'' soaring beyond the previous record by five years. Ernie told Omaha, Nebraska-based KMTV-TV last December why he likes to fly: ``I say, well, I don't know how to tell you, but you come out some morning before daylight and go out and watch that sun come up over the horizon and you'll have your answer.'' Ernie still flies in a rented plane, usually two times a week. He even braved foggy weather conditions to celebrate his 98th birthday in the sky last December.

NITA M. LOWEY of new york in the house of representatives Wednesday, September 28, 2016 Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Town of Clarkstown in Rockland County, New York, as it celebrates its 225th anniversary year. I am honored to represent this community with its richly diverse population, beautiful and thriving business districts, lovely homes and lush parks. Clarkstown was created by an act of the New York State Legislature on March 18, 1791, during George Washington's first term as President. It was part of Orange County and then of Rockland County, which was created seven years later. At Clarkstown's founding, the population had less than 2,000 residents. As New York built its early parkways and the Tappan Zee Bridge, the population grew rapidly and continues to grow. According to the United States Census, the town population now stands at more than 87,000. Its 41 square miles encompass the hamlets of Bardonia, Central Nyack, Congers, New City, Valley Cottage, West Nyack, Upper Nyack and portions of the Villages of Nyack and Spring Valley. The town, like the county, was settled by farmers, and grew as businesses opened to serve the community. During the 19th century, ice was harvested from the pristine waters of Rockland Lake, now a park, and floated down the Hudson River to barges that would supply New York City. At the same time, local quarries provided material for new construction in the city. Today, more than half of working residents are employed within the county. Most of Clarkstown's commercially zoned land exists along the town's state roadways, and within the town's hamlet centers. Residents also work at nearby pharmaceutical and tech companies that are moving into the area. Clarkstown's residents included Jacob Vanderbilt, whose property is now the site of Germonds Park, a recreational facility owned by the town. Other resident families whose holdings remain important to the town include the Cropseys, whose farm dates back to 1893. The family retired and sold the land to Clarkstown in 2006 through Rockland County's Open Space Program. Rockland Farm Alliance then signed a lease to maintain the land, thus establishing the thriving Cropsey Community Farm. The county and the town have long been a refuge for artists. Adolph Zukor, who was key to the burgeoning motion picture industry, bought property in New City on what is now called Zukor Road. The painter and muralist Henry Varnum Poor, the playwright Maxwell Anderson, and the composer Kurt Weill and his wife, the actor Lotte Lenya, lived on South Mountain Road in New City. While the attraction was the bucolic nature of the county and its considerable distance from New York City, actors and other artists are now attracted not only because the county and its homesteads are beautiful, but because of its proximity to New York City, now a short ride on roadways, trains and bridges. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in saluting the Town of Clarkstown on this special anniversary as its residents celebrate its distinguished past and look ahead to a strong future.

NITA M. LOWEY of new york in the house of representatives Wednesday, September 28, 2016 Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Town of Clarkstown in Rockland County, New York, as it celebrates its 225th anniversary year. I am honored to represent this community with its richly diverse population, beautiful and thriving business districts, lovely homes and lush parks. Clarkstown was created by an act of the New York State Legislature on March 18, 1791, during George Washington's first term as President. It was part of Orange County and then of Rockland County, which was created seven years later. At Clarkstown's founding, the population had less than 2,000 residents. As New York built its early parkways and the Tappan Zee Bridge, the population grew rapidly and continues to grow. According to the United States Census, the town population now stands at more than 87,000. Its 41 square miles encompass the hamlets of Bardonia, Central Nyack, Congers, New City, Valley Cottage, West Nyack, Upper Nyack and portions of the Villages of Nyack and Spring Valley. The town, like the county, was settled by farmers, and grew as businesses opened to serve the community. During the 19th century, ice was harvested from the pristine waters of Rockland Lake, now a park, and floated down the Hudson River to barges that would supply New York City. At the same time, local quarries provided material for new construction in the city. Today, more than half of working residents are employed within the county. Most of Clarkstown's commercially zoned land exists along the town's state roadways, and within the town's hamlet centers. Residents also work at nearby pharmaceutical and tech companies that are moving into the area.

CREC-2016-09-29-pt1-PgE1418-4,CREC-2016-09-29,114,COMMITTEE DEPATURE OF CAROLINE LYNCH,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1418-E1419] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMMITTEE DEPATURE OF CAROLINE LYNCH ______ HON. BOB GOODLATTE of virginia in the house of representatives Wednesday, September 28, 2016 Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Ranking Member John Conyers and myself, I rise in recognition of the Chief Counsel of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations, Caroline Lynch, to bid her farewell as she leaves the House Judiciary Committee. Effective House staff is indispensable. And such a description is certainly fitting for Caroline. Every action she takes as Chief Counsel proves her unwavering commitment to conservative principles and to the rule of law. But after 15 years working on Capitol Hill, Caroline has decided to move back to her home state of Arizona to be close to her family, and to pursue the next steps in her career. Needless to say, we are very sad to see her go. After graduating from law school at Arizona State University, Caroline came to Washington, D.C., to work for Congressman John Shadegg from Arizona. She served both in his personal office and for him as Chief Counsel of the House Republican Policy Committee. In 2006 Caroline began as a Counsel on the Judiciary Committee's Crime Subcommittee, and it was quickly apparent that she had found her calling. In 2008 Caroline became Chief Counsel of the Subcommittee. At the Committee, Caroline has had an enormous impact on the reform of our criminal and national security laws. In fact, few people in Washington have done as much to promote the safety of our communities. Caroline has overseen the drafting, negotiation, and passage of critical legislation regarding the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, and the most sweeping set of reforms to government surveillance practices in nearly 40 years--the USA Freedom Act, among many other priority legislative initiatives. Aside from that, she manages a Subcommittee staff that works on some of the most important topics in the country--from oversight of many of the federal law enforcement agencies, to issues such as criminal justice reform, child exploitation, cybersecurity, human trafficking and encryption. Anyone who has met Caroline knows she is an immensely intelligent, hardworking, loyal and discerning Chief Counsel. And of course, those people she has negotiated with have found her to be a skillful and formidable but fair advocate. Evidence of her dedication and influence as Chief Counsel can be seen by what some of her colleagues and former bosses have to say about her. Former Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith says, ``Caroline is a good person and a very knowledgeable attorney. As chief counsel of the Crime Subcommittee, she has been a dedicated, conscientious, and hard- working public servant. She has had a major influence on crime legislation and on keeping Americans safe and secure. Her wonderful attitude, legal expertise, and commitment to good government will be missed greatly.'' Judiciary Committee Chief of Staff and General Counsel Shelley Husband says, ``When I [[Page E1419]] first met Caroline, I was immediately struck by her intelligence, unparalleled grasp of criminal law, leadership ability and confidence, all attributes that I admire. Since that time, I have come to know Caroline's other virtues. In addition to being a brilliant lawyer, Caroline is immensely loyal, compassionate, honest and fair. And for that, she has earned my respect and affection. I am grateful every day that we are on the same side and if I'm going to be in the trenches on any issue, I want Caroline Lynch beside me.'' And Deputy Chief of Staff and Chief Counsel Branden Ritchie says, ``Caroline's expertise in criminal and national security laws and her ability to achieve legislative victories are apparent to all who work with her. She is also--without question--a natural leader. But what I have come to admire and respect most about Caroline is that she truly cares for and nurtures those she leads, she is loyal to those she serves, and she is a truth teller who is dedicated to doing what is right.'' Former Judiciary Committee Staff Director Joseph Gibson says, ``Caroline is an outstanding lawyer who knows her stuff and works tirelessly to get the policy right. She will be greatly missed.'' And another Former Judiciary Committee Staff Director Richard Hertling says, ``Few staffers are indispensable and irreplaceable, but Caroline comes as close as any I know. She reflects the very best among us. She knows both the law and the facts, and she takes the time to understand the real-world effects of everything she does. The country is better off for her service.'' George Fishman, Chief Counsel of the Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security, says ``Caroline cares so much about the job she is doing--keeping the American people safe and preserving our Constitutional liberties. Through her tireless work, Caroline's imprint is all over our nation's criminal statutes. She is the quintessential congressional staffer--dedicated, caring, knowledgeable, a fierce advocate for her Member or Committee and yet respected by all.'' And Paul Taylor, Chief Counsel of the Subcommittee on Constitution and Civil Justice says, ``Caroline is so dynamic, I've often thought there was both a Crime Subcommittee and a Caroline Subcommittee.'' Daniel Flores, Chief Counsel of the Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law Subcommittee says, ``Caroline created a brighter world for all of her colleagues on Committee, and a safer world for all Americans.'' And Joe Keeley, Chief Counsel of the Subcommittee on Courts Intellectual Property and the Internet, says ``The Judiciary Committee needs staff who understand the big picture and have an attention to detail while balancing numerous interests and priorities. Since Caroline so exceeded these requirements, her departure will leave very big shoes to fill. She will be missed by all.'' Andrea Loving, Deputy Chief Counsel of the Immigration Subcommittee, says, ``Caroline's vast knowledge of criminal and national security law and policy commands a respect like none other I have seen on Capitol Hill. Her departure is truly a loss for America.'' Even Caroline's colleagues on the other side of the aisle recognize her expertise and are sad to see her leave Capitol Hill. Perry Apelbaum, the Committee's Minority Staff Director and Chief Counsel says, ``I and our staff have very much enjoyed working with Caroline over the years. She has always been a great partner in accomplishing important work for our country. We will miss her and wish her the best.'' Bobby Vassar, former Democrat Chief Counsel of the Crime Subcommittee says ``As a Chief Counsel for almost 20 years, I had the opportunity to work with several Republican Chief Crime Counsels. Caroline was the best `enemy' I ever had. We often had diametrically opposed views to represent on some of the most controversial and contentious issues in the Congress, but were able to do so in a spirit of mutual respect that allowed us to disagree, vehemently at times, without being disagreeable.'' And Minority Oversight Counsel Aaron Hiller says, ``In any project that involves protecting the country, its people, or the prerogatives of this Committee, there is no one--and I mean no one--whom I would rather have on my team than Caroline Lynch. We will miss her very much.'' Joe Graupensperger, Minority Chief Counsel for Crime and Criminal Justice, says, ``The Crime staff on both sides of the aisle have worked together closely over the years to achieve many bipartisan successes, and Caroline was critical to each one of them. We have appreciated Caroline's openness and collegiality with her Democratic counterparts. She is a great lawyer, a strong advocate for making our nation safer, and will always be a valued friend.'' Of course, Caroline's team at the Subcommittee know her to be a determined leader and a steadfast friend. Bobby Parmiter says, ``Caroline is the definition of a `foxhole' person--exceptionally talented, dedicated, and tough. It is no exaggeration to say the American people are safer today than they would be had she not been doing this job over the past decade.'' Chris Grieco says, ``A tireless and dogged lawyer who has undoubtedly made the country a safer and more secure place because of her unparalleled knowledge of law enforcement and national security issues and her unwavering commitment to getting it right regardless of politics.'' Ryan Breitenbach says, ``Caroline is a dedicated public servant and Hill survivor, and one of the best bosses anyone can ask for. She is smart and nice, which in my opinion is the hopeful combination of any leader. Her love of her family draws her home, but not before she had given all she could to crafting our country's criminal and national security laws.'' And Jason Cervenak says, ``I met Caroline on her very first day working on the Judiciary Committee. In walked this petite red head with a smile from ear to ear and an infectious laugh. I immediately thought `she's going to get eaten alive.' Well, I think we all know I couldn't have been more wrong.'' We have appreciated Caroline's deep knowledge of criminal laws, the strength of her convictions, and her courage to speak the truth in a place where it is rarely convenient to do so. We will miss Caroline immensely. We wish her well in her new endeavors and we thank her for her years of dedicated service to this Committee, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the American people. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1418-E1419] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMMITTEE DEPATURE OF CAROLINE LYNCH ______ HON.

dynamic, i've often thought there was both a crime subcommittee and a caroline subcommittee.'' daniel flores, chief counsel of the regulatory reform, commercial and antitrust law subcommittee says, ``caroline created a brighter world for all of her colleagues on committee, and a safer world for all americans.'' and joe keeley, chief counsel of the subcommittee on courts intellectual property and the internet, says ``the judiciary committee needs staff who understand the big picture and have an attention to detail while balancing numerous interests and priorities. since caroline so exceeded these requirements, her departure will leave very big shoes to fill. she will be missed by all.'' andrea loving, deputy chief counsel of the immigration subcommittee, says, ``caroline's vast knowledge of criminal and national security law and policy commands a respect like none other i have seen on capitol hill. her departure is truly a loss for america.'' even caroline's colleagues on the other side of the aisle recognize her expertise and are sad to see her leave capitol hill. perry apelbaum, the committee's minority staff director and chief counsel says, ``i and our staff have very much enjoyed working with caroline over the years. she has always been a great partner in accomplishing important work for our country. we will miss her and wish her the best.'' bobby vassar, former democrat chief counsel of the crime subcommittee says ``as a chief counsel for almost 20 years, i had the opportunity to work with several republican chief crime counsels. caroline was the best `enemy' i ever had. we often had diametrically opposed views to represent on some of the most controversial and contentious issues in the congress, but were able to do so in a spirit of mutual respect that allowed us to disagree, vehemently at times, without being disagreeable.'' and minority oversight counsel aaron hiller says, ``in any project that involves protecting the country, its people, or the prerogatives of this committee, there is no one--and i mean no one--whom i would rather have on my team than caroline lynch. we will miss her very much.'' joe graupensperger, minority chief counsel for crime and criminal justice, says, ``the crime staff on both sides of the aisle have worked together closely over the years to achieve many bipartisan successes, and caroline was critical to each one of them. we have appreciated caroline's openness and collegiality with her democratic counterparts. she is a great lawyer, a strong advocate for making our nation safer, and will always be a valued friend.'' of course, caroline's team at the subcommittee know her to be a determined leader and a steadfast friend. bobby parmiter says, ``caroline is the definition of a `foxhole' person--exceptionally talented, dedicated, and tough. it is no exaggeration to say the american people are safer today than they would be had she not been doing this job over the past decade.'' chris grieco says, ``a tireless and dogged lawyer who has undoubtedly made the country a safer and more secure place because of her unparalleled knowledge of law enforcement and national security issues and her unwavering commitment to getting it right regardless of politics.'' ryan breitenbach says, ``caroline is a dedicated public servant and hill survivor, and one of the best bosses anyone can ask for. she is smart and nice, which in my opinion is the hopeful combination of any leader. her love of her family draws her home, but not before she had given all she could to crafting our country's criminal and national security laws.'' and jason cervenak says, ``i met caroline on her very first day working on the judiciary committee. in walked this petite red head with a smile from ear to ear and an infectious laugh. i immediately thought `she's going to get eaten alive.' well, i think we all know i couldn't have been more wrong.'' we have appreciated caroline's deep knowledge of criminal laws, the strength of her convictions, and her courage to speak the truth in a place where it is rarely convenient to do so. we will miss caroline immensely. we wish her well in her new endeavors and we thank her for her years of dedicated service to this committee, the u.s. house of representatives, and the american people. ____________________",9769

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Laurel Call for her service as a member of the Congressional Award Board of Directors. The United States Congress established the Congressional Award in 1979 to recognize initiative, achievement, and service in young people. It began as a bipartisan effort in both the United States Senate and the House of Representatives. The original bill was sponsored by the late Senator Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming and the late Congressman James Howard of New Jersey. Originally signed into law by President Jimmy Carter, the legislation (Public Law 96-114) established the Congressional Award as a public-private partnership, which receives all funding from the private sector. Every president since, both Democratic and Republican, have signed legislation to continue the program. The Congressional Award Board of Directors is comprised of 48 members and supports the work of the foundation by providing mission-based leadership and strategic governance. Every member of the Board serves as a volunteer to help make the program a national opportunity available in every congressional district. During this past year, over 40,000 participants from all 50 states were actively working toward earning a Congressional Award and 5,000 new participants enrolled in the program. Since its inception, over 7 million hours of service have been contributed to communities nationwide. The example set by Laurel is one we all should strive for. Her willingness to serve her community and our nation's young people sets her apart as an outstanding individual, and I have been honored to serve alongside of her as Leader Pelosi's congressional appointee to the Board. I ask that all of my colleagues in the House of Representatives join me in thanking Laurel for her service and wishing her nothing but continued success. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1419] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING LAUREL CALL ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of Arizona State Senator Carolyn Allen. Carolyn was born in Missouri but quickly grew to love Arizona in the warmer winter months with her husband, Jack. Carolyn became active in our community and was soon serving on local boards and commissions in the arts and in politics. Prior to her first election to the AZ House of Representatives in 1994, she was Development Director of the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation and the Scottsdale Cultural Council. She served as Executive Director (and later President of the Board) of the Scottsdale Arts Center Association. While serving 8 years in the AZ House, she was House Majority Leader as well as Chairman of the Health Committee and sponsored [[Page E1420]] major legislation in mental health care, air quality and civil rights issues. She was later elected to the Arizona State Senate and there too, she chaired multiple committees. She often said she was most proud of passing legislation protecting the McDowell Mountain Preserve and her courageous ``no'' vote on controversial immigration legislation in 2010. I had the honor of serving with Carolyn in the Legislature and I always admired her tenacity, honesty and integrity. She was the kind of public servant I aspire to be. While serving in the Legislature, she also served numerous community organizations through board membership and volunteerism. There are too many to list them all, but Carolyn's passions benefitted medical research, women's health, environmental conservation, and prison reform. Carolyn lived a brightly colored and productive life and gave so much to her community through thousands of volunteer hours for causes she championed. Despite suffering from crippling rheumatoid arthritis for more than 40 years, she soldiered on without complaint and set the bar very high for those who will follow. Her many friends will not forget her vibrant personality and determination.

SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. of georgia in the house of representatives Wednesday, September 28, 2016 Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor and pleasure to extend my personal congratulations and best wishes to a great friend and outstanding citizen, Mrs. Lydia de La Vina de Foley. Lydia has served The Congressional Club for over four decades. She will be retiring on September 30, 2016. Born and raised in La Paz, Bolivia, Lydia came to the United States as a student at Georgetown University in 1964. In 1967, she married John R. Foley III, whose father, John R. Foley II, had served the Sixth District of Maryland in the 86th Congress. As daughter-in-law of a former Member of Congress, Lydia became a member of The Congressional Club, and more recently a Lifetime Member. In 1992, she became a U.S. citizen. The Congressional Club was founded in 1908 as a Federally-chartered club for spouses of sitting or former Members of Congress, Supreme Court Justices, and Members of the President's Cabinet. Associate membership is open to active members' adult children or spouses of adult children. Mrs. Foley has been an integral part of the bipartisan Club for over one-third of its existence. Mrs. Foley's first project at the Club was illustrating its Bicentennial Cookbook in 1975. She performed secretarial duties part- time and by 1977 became the full-time Secretary to the Club President. After many years, as her responsibilities expanded, Mrs. Foley was promoted to Administrative Assistant to the Club President and in 2010, she became the Executive Director of the Congressional Club, a position that reflected her assumption of a dual role as Clubhouse Manager. Club Presidents serve for two years, alternating between Democratic and Republican Members. Mrs. Foley has served 20 of them. My wife, Vivian Creighton Bishop, served as President of the Congressional Club from 2007 to 2008 and was Chair of the First Lady's Luncheon in honor of First Lady Michelle Obama on May 12, 2016. In addition to the many demands of running the Club and the Clubhouse day in and day out, Mrs. Foley has played a vital role organizing the annual First Lady's Luncheon, as well as Diplomatic Luncheons, Chili Cook-offs, weekly Club luncheon programs, and other events too numerous to mention. A familiar face at the Club, Mrs. Foley has been lauded by Members of Congress and their spouses as well as Presidents and First Ladies for her institutional knowledge, attention to detail, and welcoming nature. We are all so grateful that Mrs. Foley has given her time and talents to making The Congressional Club a place where the spouses of Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle, and their families, can gather to offer support and enjoy each other's company. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in extending our sincerest appreciation and best wishes to Lydia de La Vina de Foley upon the occasion of her retirement from a career spanning forty-one years at the Congressional Club. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1420] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN HONOR OF LYDIA DE LA VINA DE FOLEY ______ HON.

My wife, Vivian Creighton Bishop, served as President of the Congressional Club from 2007 to 2008 and was Chair of the First Lady's Luncheon in honor of First Lady Michelle Obama on May 12, 2016. In addition to the many demands of running the Club and the Clubhouse day in and day out, Mrs. Foley has played a vital role organizing the annual First Lady's Luncheon, as well as Diplomatic Luncheons, Chili Cook-offs, weekly Club luncheon programs, and other events too numerous to mention. A familiar face at the Club, Mrs. Foley has been lauded by Members of Congress and their spouses as well as Presidents and First Ladies for her institutional knowledge, attention to detail, and welcoming nature.

The Congressional Club was founded in 1908 as a Federally-chartered club for spouses of sitting or former Members of Congress, Supreme Court Justices, and Members of the President's Cabinet. Associate membership is open to active members' adult children or spouses of adult children. Mrs. Foley has been an integral part of the bipartisan Club for over one-third of its existence. Mrs. Foley's first project at the Club was illustrating its Bicentennial Cookbook in 1975. She performed secretarial duties part- time and by 1977 became the full-time Secretary to the Club President.

The county lies in the northeastern part of Indiana's Fourth Congressional District. Cass County was established in 1838, and it was named for General Lewis Cass, the 2nd Territorial Governor of Michigan. Home to the Wabash River, for many years Cass County was a canal town. In 1855, however, the first locomotive made its way through the county seat of Logansport creating a permanent relationship between the town and trains. By the 1920s, over 225 trains passed through the county each day, and over 3,000 persons in the area were employed by the railroad. In this year of the Hoosier Bicentennial, communities throughout the state are celebrating Indiana's past and present through Bicentennial Legacy Projects. These projects are culturally inclusive, celebratory, engaging and inspiring to youth and young adults and create a legacy for the future. The organizations responsible for the Legacy Projects throughout the county include the Logansport Children's Choir, Logan's Landing, Civic Players of Logansport, Logansport Rose Society, [[Page E1421]] Cass County Arts Alliance, State Theatre Preservation Society Corporation, Cass County 4-H Association, Cass County Historical Society, William Pace Lodge, Cass County Dentzel Carousel, and the Trinity Episcopal Church.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my constituent Michele Coates of Loudoun County, Virginia, for her heroic actions on September 23rd, 2016. Michele has been driving school buses in Loudoun County for the past 14 years and recently demonstrated her commitment to the safety of her students. During her usual route to Harmony Middle School in Hamilton, Virginia, Michele was confronted by a situation she never thought she would have to face. While driving on Berlin Turnpike, Michele and her students noticed an unusual odor circulating the bus cabin. After safely pulling the bus over to the side of the road, Michele put the lives of her students above that of her own and ensured that all 32 students evacuated the bus safely. When emergency personnel arrived at the scene, they immediately determined that the bus was suffering from a smoke and gas leak. It was at this point that Michele realized that she did not feel well and was subsequently taken to the emergency room at Cornwall Inova for smoke inhalation. Even while she was in the ambulance, Michele's main concern was the safety of her students. In all, seventeen students were taken to Cornwall Inova to receive treatment for their exposure to the toxic fumes. Had Michele not been so quick thinking and selfless, that day could have ended much worse. Mr. Speaker, Michele Coates does not ask for recognition. She claims that her actions were not heroic, rather her duty. This is why I ask that my colleagues join me in thanking Michele for her actions, which without a doubt saved the lives of those 32 schoolchildren on that bus. I applaud her for her willingness to endanger herself in order to protect her students. I wish her all the best in her recovery, as well as her future endeavors. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1420] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE HEROIC ACTIONS OF MICHELE COATES ______ HON.

Benton, a U.S. Senator from Missouri. Though the land is fertile and agriculture is vital to the county economically, Benton County is also known for housing one of the largest windfarms in the United States. Its most famous resident may be Dan Patch, a Hoosier born horse legend who has held the title of ``World's Champion Harness Horse'' for over one-hundred years. In this year of the Hoosier Bicentennial, communities throughout the state are celebrating Indiana's past and present through Bicentennial Legacy Projects. These projects are culturally inclusive, celebratory, engaging and inspiring to youth and young adults and create a legacy for the future. The organizations responsible for the Legacy Projects throughout the county include the Benton County Economic Development Department, Otterbein Public Library, Benton County's Bicentennial Committee, Benton Central Junior-Senior High School, Benton County Public Library, DNR Division of Fish & Wildlife, and the Benton County 4-H Council.

Tom Bertolino, vice president of NorCal Kenworth, a multistore commercial truck dealer in Anderson, California which is located in my Congressional district, was named the 2016 Truck Dealer of the Year by the American Truck Dealers (ATD), Heavy Duty Trucking magazine and Procede Software. Mr. Bertolino received this highest honor out of a select group of commercial truck dealers from around the country during the 53rd annual ATD Convention & Expo in Las Vegas in April. All of the nominees were selected by state, metro and national truck dealer association leaders. A panel of professors from Indiana University's Kelley School of Business analyzed the nominees' dealership performances, industry leadership and civic contributions and made their final selection. Mr. Bertolino entered the dealer industry seventeen years ago when he left Kenworth Truck Company to pursue a dream to own a Kenworth dealership in Northern California. Tom and his business partner Mr. Harry Mamizuka have grown NorCal Kenworth into four locations-- Anderson, San Leandro, Morgan Hill and Sacramento. As the largest Kenworth dealer organization in Northern California, NorCal Kenworth employs nearly 200 people and carries an extensive inventory of new and used trucks that feature the latest engineering and technological advancements. NorCal PacLease includes full-service lease, finance lease, contract maintenance, and short and long term truck rentals. In his capacity as the 2016 Truck Dealer of the Year, Mr. Bertolino will serve as an Honorary Member of the ATD Board of Line Representatives and will serve as a national spokesman on industry issues impacting commercial truck dealers.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the achievements of one of the 10th Congressional District's bravest constituents, Sergeant Tim Bristol of the Berryville Police Department. This law enforcement officer's unwavering courage and dedication to protecting the community is a noble example of public service. Sergeant Bristol deserves the thanks of not only the communities in which he serves, but also that of his elected officials. Sergeant Bristol began working for the Berryville police department in December of 2007. He previously worked for the Glasford Police Department in Illinois. Tim is the sergeant for the department as well as a field [[Page E1422]] training officer, general instructor, and speed measurement instructor. As the sergeant, Tim routinely makes sure that the department is running efficiently and that all officers are current on their required training. Maintaining and reviewing training records for compliance is a huge task in and of itself, yet Tim still finds the time to accomplish so much more and plans for the future of the department. Tim is a well-respected supervisor, promotes a professional image of the department, and is a confident leader. During the past year Tim has spent countless hours in his role as a field training officer preparing new recruits and experienced officers new to the department for patrol in the community of Berryville. He takes this responsibility seriously and always looks for ways to improve the way training is delivered to those new to the career or department. Tim is the right-hand man of the Chief of Police who could not ask for a better person to fill that role. It is abundantly clear to the Chief that Tim is wholly invested in making the Berryville Police Department an example of professionalism and dedication to community service. The Chief often wonders if his mind is ever focused on anything else aside from moving the department forward, which is a testament to his loyalty and dedication. He is truly a deserving recipient and a stellar example of a professional law enforcement officer. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Sergeant Tim Bristol of the Berryville Police Department for protecting and serving the community day-in and day-out. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1421-E1422] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF SERGEANT TIM BRISTOL OF THE BERRYVILLE POLICE DEPARTMENT ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the achievements of one of the 10th Congressional District's bravest constituents, Deputy Matt Watson of the Winchester City Sheriff's Office. This law enforcement officer's unwavering courage and dedication to protecting the community is a noble example of public service. Deputy Watson deserves the thanks of not only the communities in which he serves, but also that of his elected officials. Deputy Watson has been an auxiliary deputy with the Winchester City Sheriff's Office for two years. Although this is a relatively short time in his 16 year career, Deputy Watson has contributed an abundance of knowledge and talent to the office. Deputy Watson has excelled in tactical training and has started his own business, tactical operations consulting (TOC). Deputy Watson has been instructing law enforcement, military and state department employees prior to their deployment into hostile areas in the world. Even though Matt Watson keeps a very busy schedule, he has continued to volunteer his time here at the city sheriff's office. Deputy Watson approached the Sheriff about taking the existing emergency response team implemented there to provide knowledge and training to help create the first ever Special Response Team (SRT) in the city sheriff's office. The team is a part-time law enforcement special operations team that is designed to respond in a tactical manner to incidents in support of, or outside the capabilities of, the Winchester City Sheriff's Office. Deputy Watson not only provides training for the SRT but for the entire staff. Being able to have someone like Matt who is certified as a tactical medic, defensive tactics and firearm instructor as part of this team is greatly beneficial. Again, I would like to point out that this is all on a volunteer basis. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Deputy Matt Watson of the Winchester City Sheriff's Office for protecting and serving the community day-in and day-out. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1422] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF DEPUTY MATT WATSON OF THE WINCHESTER CITY SHERIFF'S OFFICE ______ HON.

CREC-2016-09-29-pt1-PgE1423,CREC-2016-09-29,114,COMBATING ANTI-SEMITISM AND THE BDS MOVEMENT,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1423] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMBATING ANTI-SEMITISM AND THE BDS MOVEMENT ______ HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH of new jersey in the house of representatives Wednesday, September 28, 2016 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the troubling rise of anti-Semitism and to call for action against the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement--a hateful weapon intended to delegitimize Israel and the Jewish community. According to Pew Research Center, instances of anti-Semitism are at a 7-year high. It is getting worse everywhere, particularly in the Middle East, but also in Europe and even in the United States. That's why I've cosponsored the Combating BDS Act of 2016 (H.R. 4514). This legislation clarifies that state and local governments have the authority to pass and enforce laws that prohibit public funding to institutions that engage in the odious BDS campaign, the purpose of which is to apply double standards that delegitimize and demonize Israel. Thankfully, many states have responded to the BDS campaign by enacting legislation that denies public support to any organization engaged in the campaign--just last month my home state of New Jersey became the 11th state to enact such a law. The boycott campaign against Israel is a complete discredit to its organizers--the government of Israel has by far the best record for human rights, democracy, rule of law, and general humanity toward both its own citizens and its neighbors' citizens, including the Palestinians--of any country in the Middle East. This despite the fact that some of its neighboring governments support or harbor terrorists whose goal is the genocidal annihilation of Israel.

CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH of new jersey in the house of representatives Wednesday, September 28, 2016 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the troubling rise of anti-Semitism and to call for action against the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement--a hateful weapon intended to delegitimize Israel and the Jewish community. According to Pew Research Center, instances of anti-Semitism are at a 7-year high. It is getting worse everywhere, particularly in the Middle East, but also in Europe and even in the United States. That's why I've cosponsored the Combating BDS Act of 2016 (H.R. 4514). This legislation clarifies that state and local governments have the authority to pass and enforce laws that prohibit public funding to institutions that engage in the odious BDS campaign, the purpose of which is to apply double standards that delegitimize and demonize Israel. Thankfully, many states have responded to the BDS campaign by enacting legislation that denies public support to any organization engaged in the campaign--just last month my home state of New Jersey became the 11th state to enact such a law. The boycott campaign against Israel is a complete discredit to its organizers--the government of Israel has by far the best record for human rights, democracy, rule of law, and general humanity toward both its own citizens and its neighbors' citizens, including the Palestinians--of any country in the Middle East. This despite the fact that some of its neighboring governments support or harbor terrorists whose goal is the genocidal annihilation of Israel.

HOUGH OF THE CLARKE COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE ______ HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK of virginia in the house of representatives Wednesday, September 28, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the achievements of one of the 10th Congressional District's bravest constituents, Sergeant Jason M. Hough of the Clarke County Sheriff's Office. This law enforcement officer's unwavering courage and dedication to protecting the community is a noble example of public service. Sergeant Hough deserves the thanks of not only the communities in which he serves, but also that of his elected officials. Sergeant Hough joined the Clarke County Sheriff's Office in June 2012. As a field deputy, he was always a top producer in the office. In June 2015 Jason assumed supervisory duties when he was promoted to sergeant. He has accepted the additional responsibilities and responded well to the additional duties. On March 4, 2016, Sergeant Jason M. Hough responded to a house in the town of Berryville for a report of a possible overdose. When Sergeant Hough arrived on the scene, he found an unconscious male lying on a bed. Jason checked to see if the male was breathing and if he had a pulse. He discovered that although the male had a good pulse, he was not breathing. Sergeant Hough began to perform mouth to mouth resuscitation. Medics arrived shortly thereafter and provided Sergeant Hough with a bag valve mask so he could continue to provide respirations to the victim. The victim did breathe on his own several times, but quit after a few breaths. According to witnesses on the scene, the victim had overdosed on heroin. The medics administered three rounds of Narcan though an IV. The victim regained consciousness and became very aggressive, screaming over and over. Sergeant Hough had to restrain the victim so that he could continue to receive medical care. The victim was taken to the ambulance. The victim had calmed down by this time, which allowed Sergeant Hough to tell him what had happened and that he was being taken to the hospital for overdosing. Without the actions of Sergeant Hough, the victim could have died. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Sergeant Jason M.

G. K. BUTTERFIELD of north carolina in the house of representatives Wednesday, September 28, 2016 Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 150th anniversary of First Baptist Church, located in my congressional district in Weldon, North Carolina. First Baptist Church takes pride in being one of the first Black Baptist churches in North Carolina. Founded in 1866, a year after the U.S. Congress passed the 13th Amendment to abolish slavery, Reverend Joseph Baysmore and several faith leaders devoted to spreading the word of God organized the Church. In the Church's early days, Reverend Baysmore and his small congregation gathered to worship under a bush arbor, which was later replaced by a wooden structure lacking ceilings and heat. Mr. Speaker, much of First Baptist Church's growth over the years can be attributed to its dedicated leadership and congregation. In 1909, the Church moved into its current site under the leadership of Reverend John W. Faulk, Sr. During this time, the Church went from offering only second and fourth Sunday service to offering services every Sunday. Even early on, the Church was active in civic engagement and served as the first meeting site for the Halifax County Chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in the early 1940s. In the 1990s, the Church added a radio ministry to broadcast the Sunday morning worship on the local radio station. Since 2002, First Baptist Church has been pastored by Reverend Quientrell L. Burrell, II. Under Rev. Burrell's leadership, the Church continues to prosper and serve its community. First Baptist Church has expanded its service to the community through health seminars, single parent clinics, and healthy relationship sessions. Today, First Baptist Church remains a pillar of the Weldon community and in the state of North Carolina. [[Page E1424]] With the theme ``Rooted in Faith, Racing Toward the Future,'' this 150th anniversary observes the labor and sacrifices made over 150 years as well as the Church's promise for the future. Through its outstanding leadership and a devoted congregation, I am confident that First Baptist will continue to withstand the test of time for generations to come. By the grace of God, First Baptist Church has survived the test of time with its strong faith and belief and it is still going strong today. Over the years, the Church has realized many notable accomplishments including significant growth in membership and ministry and continued outreach in the community. Mr. Speaker, I celebrate the rich legacy of First Baptist Church in Weldon, North Carolina and I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating Rev. Burrell, the congregation, and the residents of Weldon on this historic milestone. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1423-E1424] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMMEMORATING THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH, WELDON, NORTH CAROLINA ______ HON.

G. K. BUTTERFIELD of north carolina in the house of representatives Wednesday, September 28, 2016 Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 150th anniversary of First Baptist Church, located in my congressional district in Weldon, North Carolina. First Baptist Church takes pride in being one of the first Black Baptist churches in North Carolina. Founded in 1866, a year after the U.S. Congress passed the 13th Amendment to abolish slavery, Reverend Joseph Baysmore and several faith leaders devoted to spreading the word of God organized the Church. In the Church's early days, Reverend Baysmore and his small congregation gathered to worship under a bush arbor, which was later replaced by a wooden structure lacking ceilings and heat. Mr. Speaker, much of First Baptist Church's growth over the years can be attributed to its dedicated leadership and congregation. In 1909, the Church moved into its current site under the leadership of Reverend John W. Faulk, Sr. During this time, the Church went from offering only second and fourth Sunday service to offering services every Sunday. Even early on, the Church was active in civic engagement and served as the first meeting site for the Halifax County Chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in the early 1940s. In the 1990s, the Church added a radio ministry to broadcast the Sunday morning worship on the local radio station. Since 2002, First Baptist Church has been pastored by Reverend Quientrell L. Burrell, II. Under Rev. Burrell's leadership, the Church continues to prosper and serve its community. First Baptist Church has expanded its service to the community through health seminars, single parent clinics, and healthy relationship sessions. Today, First Baptist Church remains a pillar of the Weldon community and in the state of North Carolina. [[Page E1424]] With the theme ``Rooted in Faith, Racing Toward the Future,'' this 150th anniversary observes the labor and sacrifices made over 150 years as well as the Church's promise for the future. Through its outstanding leadership and a devoted congregation, I am confident that First Baptist will continue to withstand the test of time for generations to come. By the grace of God, First Baptist Church has survived the test of time with its strong faith and belief and it is still going strong today. Over the years, the Church has realized many notable accomplishments including significant growth in membership and ministry and continued outreach in the community. Mr. Speaker, I celebrate the rich legacy of First Baptist Church in Weldon, North Carolina and I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating Rev. Burrell, the congregation, and the residents of Weldon on this historic milestone. ____________________",package_114_206.csv,3116,3116,3190,"[congressional record volume 162, number 148 (thursday, september 29, 2016)] [extensions of remarks] [pages e1423-e1424] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] commemorating the 150th anniversary of first baptist church, weldon, north carolina ______ hon. g. k. butterfield of north carolina in the house of representatives wednesday, september 28, 2016 mr. butterfield. mr. speaker, i rise today to commemorate the 150th anniversary of first baptist church, located in my congressional district in weldon, north carolina. first baptist church takes pride in being one of the first black baptist churches in north carolina. founded in 1866, a year after the u.s. congress passed the 13th amendment to abolish slavery, reverend joseph baysmore and several faith leaders devoted to spreading the word of god organized the church. in the church's early days, reverend baysmore and his small congregation gathered to worship under a bush arbor, which was later replaced by a wooden structure lacking ceilings and heat. mr. speaker, much of first baptist church's growth over the years can be attributed to its dedicated leadership and congregation. in 1909, the church moved into its current site under the leadership of reverend john w. faulk, sr. during this time, the church went from offering only second and fourth sunday service to offering services every sunday. even early on, the church was active in civic engagement and served as the first meeting site for the halifax county chapter of the national association for the advancement of colored people (naacp) in the early 1940s. in the 1990s, the church added a radio ministry to broadcast the sunday morning worship on the local radio station. since 2002, first baptist church has been pastored by reverend quientrell l. burrell, ii. under rev. burrell's leadership, the church continues to prosper and serve its community. first baptist church has expanded its service to the community through health seminars, single parent clinics, and healthy relationship sessions. today, first baptist church remains a pillar of the weldon community and in the state of north carolina.

This law enforcement officer's unwavering courage and dedication to protecting the community is a noble example of public service. Officer Specksgoor deserves the thanks of not only the communities in which he serves, but also that of his elected officials. Officer Specksgoor is a member of the Community Response Team (CRT). One of his duties as part of the CRT is interacting with the kids who have been assigned to the CRT from the courts and schools. All these children have had significant trouble in school and with the police. As you can imagine, they are often very difficult and challenging to deal with. Despite these challenges, plus his many other duties, Officer Specksgoor deals with these kids and families in a very professional manner. It has been noted that Andrew Specksgoor interacts with not only the children but also with their families to try to keep these kids out of future trouble. This is a job that many employees would shy away from, but Officer Specksgoor tackles this job with enthusiasm and professionalism. His supervisor has noted that he excels in mentoring these young people. He holds them accountable for good behavior while interacting with them each day in a positive fashion.

This law enforcement officer's unwavering courage and dedication to protecting the community is a noble example of public service. Deputy Renner deserves the thanks of not only the communities in which he serves, but also that of his elected officials. On August 14, 2015 Craig Dehaven became a victim of a burglary at his residence. Deputy Renner responded and processed the scene recovering latent prints and additional evidence that was located directly below a window that was entered during the incident. Deputy Renner collected the evidence and it was sent to the forensic lab for further processing. Results were received back from the lab on May 24, 2016 and a DNA match was found. The recovered evidence contained a DNA profile that matched a specific subject. On May 26, 2016 investigators were able to interview the subject and they obtained a full confession along with the location of the stolen items during this incident. The items were recovered and returned to the rightful owner, thanks to the diligent and thorough work performed by Deputy Renner. Had he not done this, the victim would not have had closure in this burglary. In addition several other incidents involved would also not have been cleared.

H. MORGAN GRIFFITH of virginia in the house of representatives Wednesday, September 28, 2016 Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to recognize the 150th anniversary of the Schaeffer Memorial Baptist Church. Since it was built in 1885, the church has served as a place of worship, as well as a location for community activities and other gatherings. I have had the pleasure of visiting the Schaeffer Memorial Baptist Church and appreciate the rich history of the building. Since its founding so many decades ago, the church has grown into a place for the New River Valley African American community to worship and celebrate their history and heritage, as well as host events such as the Annual Memorial for Martin Luther King Junior. The Schaeffer Memorial Baptist Church is a brick building, described as Victorian Gothic style. The church is characterized by a tall tower in the southeast corner and its gable roof. Along with the Hill School and the Primary Annex, the buildings make up the Old Christiansburg Industrial Institute. In 2001, the complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The church was founded by Captain Charles S. Schaeffer, from Pennsylvania. After the War Between the States, he was assigned to Southwest Virginia to work for the Freedmen's Bureau. He worked to assist the African American community economically, and also worked to assist the community spiritually. He strived to provide education, technical skills, and knowledge of Christianity. He set up, organized, and managed several African American churches, which led to the baptism of hundreds. It is said that Captain Schaeffer was respected for practicing as he preached, and for truly living out the ideals he spoke of. According to the records of the Schaeffer Memorial Baptist Church, the building was completed and dedicated as a ``temple built unto the LORD on the mountaintop'' on October 4, 1885. At the dedication service, Captain Schaeffer gave the trustees of the church a deed to the property. I am proud to honor this historical site in Christiansburg, Virginia, and recognize all those who have found faith, comfort, and friendships as part of the Schaffer Memorial Baptist Church community since it was founded 150 years ago. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 148 (Thursday, September 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1425] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SCHAEFFER MEMORIAL BAPTIST CHURCH ______ HON.

This law enforcement officer's unwavering courage and dedication to protecting the community is a noble example of public service. Special Agent Perry deserves the thanks of not only the communities in which he serves, but also that of his elected officials. Special Agent Perry is the coordinator of the Northwest Virginia Regional Drug Task Force and serves in many capacities as such. Special Agent Perry oversees the operations of the drug task force offices in Winchester, Front Royal, Shenandoah County and Page County. Special Agent Perry provides outstanding leadership to the local task force agents as well as to the communities we represent. Special Agent Perry has been instrumental in helping to establish the new drug courts and in getting recent legislation passed to assist law enforcement in combating drug issues. Special Agent Perry works closely with community groups such as ``The Road to Recovery'', ``The Heroin Coalition'' and other community based groups to establish trusting and working relationships with not only the drug task force but with all law enforcement entities in the communities. Special Agent Perry, although extremely busy in his capacity as the task force coordinator, can still be found on the scene of drug arrests, search warrants and other investigations lending a hand and often guidance in these cases. During the 2015/2016 year, Special Agent Perry has been responsible for building and maintaining a system to monitor drug overdoses and fatalities in the communities. This information has proven to be valuable to many local groups to include law enforcement, community groups, medical professionals and recovery groups. Special Agent Perry maintains a close working relationship with each drug task force team leader to assure that this information is updated regularly and shared within the partnerships that have been created to combat the current heroin epidemic we are battling. Special Agent Perry has been actively involved with and continues to fight to have the region designated as a High Intensity Drug Area (HIDTA) in order for the local law enforcement partners to receive funding and support, which will allow us to continue to fight this current drug epidemic that we are experiencing in the communities.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and salute Montgomery County, Indiana as the Indiana Bicentennial Torch is scheduled to pass through the county on Thursday, October 13, 2016. The County sits in the central part of Indiana's Fourth Congressional District. It was established in 1822 and named for Richard Montgomery, an American Revolutionary War general killed in 1775 at the Battle of Quebec. The county seat is located in Crawfordsville, where Henry S. Lane resided. Mr. Lane, a former Senator, was an early leader of the Republican Party and influential in the nomination of Abraham Lincoln. The county is also known for being the residence of Lew Wallace, author of the popular nineteenth-century novel Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ. While richly steeped in history, Montgomery County is home to my alma mater, Wabash College, and holds a special place in my heart. In this year of the Hoosier Bicentennial, communities throughout the state are celebrating Indiana past and present through Bicentennial Legacy Projects. These projects are culturally inclusive, celebratory, engaging, and inspiring to youth and young adults and create a legacy for the future. The organizations responsible for the twenty three Legacy Projects throughout the county are: Crawfordsville Parks and Recreation Department, Montgomery County Historical Society, Westchester Public Library, DNR Division of Nature Preserves, Lew Wallace Study & Museum, DNR Division of State Parks & Reservoirs, American Legion Byron Cox Post 72, Crossroad of America, Boy Scouts of America, Amy Westphal, Jerald M. Jascoviak, and the Crawfordsville/ Montgomery County Chamber of Commerce. Hoosiers look forward to their enduring contribution to our state's legacy. And on this day, Mr. Speaker, in the year in which we are celebrating Indiana's 200th birthday, I am proud to recognize Montgomery County for the contribution of its residents to the past, present, and future of Indiana's history.

This law enforcement officer's unwavering courage and dedication to protecting the community is a noble example of public service. Officer Sherman deserves the thanks of not only the communities in which he serves, but also that of his elected officials. [[Page E1427]] Officer Sherman routinely performs above and beyond his duties as a police officer by undertaking additional duties and tasks for improving the skills of his fellow police officers and the department as a whole. Officer Sherman, without hesitation, took on the responsibility of serving as the lead instructor for the department's protective service operations, which is required for the officers to be sworn in as special deputy, U.S. marshals. Additionally, Officer Sherman serves as one of the department's active shooter and non-lethal training instructors. He consistently develops creative and challenging training scenarios for improving the officers' skills in responding to and mitigating the impacts of an active shooter incident. He also was an instrumental part of the working group that created the Mount Weather emergency services division's tactical emergency casualty care policy, which dramatically improved the joint training and response of the Mount Weather police and fire departments during active shooter incidents. Recently Officer Sherman assisted with improving the department's security mission in the areas of aircraft security screens and random security measures as part of the department's security posture levels. His proposal for changing the positioning of officers during aircraft arrivals led to more efficient and effective security screening operations, and his recommended security measures will improve the overall force protection of the facility. Officer Sherman has continually shown himself as a professional police officer displaying the highest degree of competence, esprit de corps, and dedication to the mission of Mount Weather. The Mount Weather police department can think of no finer police officer more deserving of recognition than Officer Andrew Sherman.
