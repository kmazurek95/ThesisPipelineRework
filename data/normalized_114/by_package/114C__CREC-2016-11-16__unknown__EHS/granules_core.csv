The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. Vargas) for 5 minutes. Mr. VARGAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Ramon ``Chunky'' Sanchez, an exceptional musician and activist for the community of San Diego. Chunky Sanchez passed away on Friday, October 28, 2016, a few days before his 65th birthday. Chunky Sanchez was born in 1951, in Blythe, California, to Mexican immigrant parents. He was a talented musician who was taught traditional Mexican music by his mother and his uncles. Chunky Sanchez quickly learned how to sing, play 10 different instruments, and compose his own music. In 1969, he attended San Diego State University on a scholarship and began performing with La Rondalla Amerindia de Aztlan, a noted musical group composed of students and professors. Later, Chunky Sanchez became a vocalist for the folklore group Los Alacranes, the Scorpions, which he co-founded along with his brother, Ricardo. They recorded their first album in 1977. Through his music, he would tell the story of the Chicano movement and of the Mexican American bicultural experience. Chunky Sanchez was so well received that labor leader Cesar Chavez would often invite him to play at his union rallies. Chunky Sanchez was also an incredibly active member of the San Diego community. In his song ``Rising Souls,'' he sang that he needed and we needed ``to educate, not incarcerate, so that humanity will shine.'' During his lifetime, he embodied these lyrics as he worked with local youth as a coach, an educator, a youth center director, and a gang intervention counselor. His passion and care for the community garnered numerous awards and honors from organizations across California and throughout the city of San Diego. Chunky Sanchez is best known for his song ``Chicano Park Samba,'' which narrated the struggle for and the successful creation of Chicano Park in San Diego. A city historic landmark, Chicano Park honors the history of the Chicano Mexican people throughout their monumental works and murals and sculptures and earthworks, and an architectural piece. Ramon ``Chunky'' Sanchez will be missed by his family, his wife, his five children, many grandchildren, and the San Diego community. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the lyrics of the ``Chicano Park Samba.'' Chicano Park Samba (By: Los Alacranes Mojados: Chunky Sanchez, Ricardo Sanchez, Mario Aguilar, Marco Antonio Rodriguez) In the year the year 1970, in the city of San Diego, under the Coronado Bridge, lied a little piece of land, a piece of land that the community of Logan Heights wanted to make into a park . . . A park where all the chavalitos could play in so they wouldn't have to play in the street and get run over by a car . . . a park where all the viejitos could come and just sit down and watch the sun go down in the tarde . . . a park where all the familias could come and just get together on a Sunday afternoon and celebrate the spirit of life itself. But the city of San Diego said, ``Chale. We're going to make a highway patrol substation here, man.'' So on April 22nd, 1970, la raza of Logan Heights and other Chicano communities of San Diego got together, and they organized . . . and they walked on the land, and they took it over with their picks and their shovels and they began to build their park. And today, that little piece of land under the Coronado Bridge is known to everybody . . . as Chicano Park . . . ¡Orale! It began in 1970, under the Coronado Bridge En mi barrio, in San Diego Where my people began to fight For Chicano Park, for Chicano Park Under the bridge, under the bridge, under the bridge . . . We shall continue to live my brother, We shall continue to fight my friend For Chicano Park, under the bridge . . . ¡Raza!, ¡Que vivan, que vivan, Los barrios unidos! Por Ramon `Chunky' Sanchez.

CREC-2016-11-16-pt1-PgH6241-4,CREC-2016-11-16,114,CLIMATE CHANGE,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [House] [Pages H6241-H6242] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CLIMATE CHANGE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Quigley) for 5 minutes. Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, it has been 32 years since we have experienced a single month with a temperature below the 20th century average. We are now all but certain that 2016 will be the single hottest year on record, replacing 2015 and 2014, which both held that title before it. As we stand here today, representatives from 195 nations, including our own, are meeting in Morocco to discuss how the world will move forward to implement the historic Paris Agreement forged last December. Yet, in that same 1-year span, the President-elect used his campaign for our country's highest office to promote policy ideas that would not only pollute the planet, but expose millions of Americans and billions worldwide to loss of life, livelihood, and property. If these dangerous ideas are put into action, they will imperil the unique and fragile ecosystems that make the United States a wonder of the world, and saddle our economy with potentially trillions of dollars in increased health care, disaster recovery, and adaptation costs, all while preventing American businesses and consumers from realizing the economic opportunities of a low-carbon economy. We have heard from the next Commander in Chief that climate change is a hoax concocted by the Chinese, which is beyond absurdity. Climate change is real, it is happening, and it is manmade. The science is settled with 97 percent of climate scientists in strong, steadfast agreement. Just take a look at the last month here in the United States. In October, more than 5,600 all-time high temperature records were set. Only 350 all-time cold records happened in the same time span. In a stable climate, these numbers would be about even. We do not have a stable climate. Our next President has also claimed that climate change action is costing our country money when, in fact, the opposite is true. Independent analysis has demonstrated that President Obama's Clean Power Plan could save the United States more than $20 billion a year in decreased costs related to climate impacts, and will put more than $80 a year back into the pockets of everyday Americans in decreased energy costs by 2030; not to mention the economic activity that would be spurred by the creation of thousands of new clean energy jobs. The Federal Government has also found that damage to human health, agricultural losses, decreased bio diversity, and the physical impacts of sea level rise, drought, wildfires, and other climate impacts will cost more than $150 billion a year in the United States alone. We have heard talk about bringing back coal and creating new coal jobs, like it is flipping a switch. The fact is, though, that the economic decline in the coal industry and in the coal communities is driven by market forces, not government policy. While coal is still our dirtiest form of fuel, it is no longer our cheapest. Natural gas has now overtaken coal and, in some cases, even renewables like wind and solar have become cost-competitive. Coal is in decline because, increasingly, consumers no longer want it. And thanks to technological advances in the industry, it takes fewer people to mine more coal. Coal jobs in West Virginia have been declining since the fifties, long before any existing climate policy. At the same time, as extractive industries continue to slash jobs and profits, the solar industry alone has more than doubled its domestic workforce in the last 5 years and now employs more people than coal. Jobs in renewable energy exist. They are increasingly available, they pay well, and they cannot be outsourced. Finally, there has been talk about canceling the historic Paris Agreement and reneging on our international pledges to join the world in acting on climate change. Doing so would abdicate our position as a global leader, and it would allow our international rivals like China to set the terms of the new global economy to benefit them, at the expense of our people and our businesses. The fact is, our climate is changing and will only continue to do so. We [[Page H6242]] cannot afford inaction. We cannot afford to undo the progress we have already made. I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand up for coastal communities, farmers, vulnerable people all over the world, and future generations to not fall victim to the self-serving propaganda from those who seek to profit by polluting the world. To defend the work we have done, we must meet the challenge of the global call to act on climate. Regardless of who sits in the Oval Office, we must continue to fight for commonsense action in Congress that will address the pressing environmental threats of today in order to create a more sustainable future for tomorrow. No partisan rhetoric or repudiations of fact can stand in the way of our important work to fight and win this battle. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [House] [Pages H6241-H6242] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CLIMATE CHANGE The SPEAKER pro tempore.

not to mention the economic activity that would be spurred by the creation of thousands of new clean energy jobs. the federal government has also found that damage to human health, agricultural losses, decreased bio diversity, and the physical impacts of sea level rise, drought, wildfires, and other climate impacts will cost more than $150 billion a year in the united states alone. we have heard talk about bringing back coal and creating new coal jobs, like it is flipping a switch. the fact is, though, that the economic decline in the coal industry and in the coal communities is driven by market forces, not government policy. while coal is still our dirtiest form of fuel, it is no longer our cheapest. natural gas has now overtaken coal and, in some cases, even renewables like wind and solar have become cost-competitive. coal is in decline because, increasingly, consumers no longer want it. and thanks to technological advances in the industry, it takes fewer people to mine more coal. coal jobs in west virginia have been declining since the fifties, long before any existing climate policy. at the same time, as extractive industries continue to slash jobs and profits, the solar industry alone has more than doubled its domestic workforce in the last 5 years and now employs more people than coal. jobs in renewable energy exist. they are increasingly available, they pay well, and they cannot be outsourced. finally, there has been talk about canceling the historic paris agreement and reneging on our international pledges to join the world in acting on climate change. doing so would abdicate our position as a global leader, and it would allow our international rivals like china to set the terms of the new global economy to benefit them, at the expense of our people and our businesses. the fact is, our climate is changing and will only continue to do so. we [[page h6242]] cannot afford inaction. we cannot afford to undo the progress we have already made. i call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand up for coastal communities, farmers, vulnerable people all over the world, and future generations to not fall victim to the self-serving propaganda from those who seek to profit by polluting the world. to defend the work we have done, we must meet the challenge of the global call to act on climate. regardless of who sits in the oval office, we must continue to fight for commonsense action in congress that will address the pressing environmental threats of today in order to create a more sustainable future for tomorrow. no partisan rhetoric or repudiations of fact can stand in the way of our important work to fight and win this battle. ____________________",5167

Mr. Speaker, time is running out to do right by our retired coal miners and their widows. When they went down into the mines, they were made a promise: When you retire, you will have good pensions and healthcare benefits. They literally put their lives on the line to put food on their table and power our nation, but now that promise is in jeopardy. At the end of the year, the healthcare benefits for many miners and their widows will dry up, and their pensions could end soon as well. These families are worried about making ends meet, and they are going into the holidays with great uncertainty about what the new year will bring. We have a solution. It is called the Coal Healthcare and Pension Miners Protection Act, legislation which I am proud to cosponsor. It is a bipartisan bill, and a similar bill is actually pending in the Senate. Congress needs to act to fulfill this promise. Our miners have done so much for our country. They mined the coal that made the steel that built the skyscrapers and won world wars. These miners and their families deserve no less than what they worked their entire lives to earn: the peace of mind that comes with a pension. I urge my colleagues to keep the promise and support this important legislation. Time is running out to stand up for our miners and their families. Relief from Presidential Midnight Rules Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, in just 64 days, a new President will be sworn in. That is 64 days for the current President, President Obama, to jam through new regulations; new regulations that will hurt our families, kill our jobs, and continue damaging our economies. We saw that just this morning when his administration released the final environmental study for the stream buffer zone rule. This rule continues the administration's war on coal and will take it even further down the road of killing jobs in West Virginia. Congress and the States have all issued opposition to this rule, but this administration didn't listen. It is full steam ahead for this radical agenda and overregulation from the Obama administration. That is why I am proud to support what is known as the Midnight Rules Relief Act. We are voting on it this week. This bill is simple. It gives Congress the authority to review and reject rules that this President, President Obama, or any President issues during the final months of their term. American families and businesses have suffered long enough under this administration's, this President's regulatory onslaught, and they have spoken loud and clear at the polls that they do not want more business as usual from Washington. This administration cannot be allowed to force its job-killing regulations on the American people after their policies have been so soundly rejected.

CREC-2016-11-16-pt1-PgH6243,CREC-2016-11-16,114,THE SENATE MUST REFORM CLOTURE,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [House] [Page H6243] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE SENATE MUST REFORM CLOTURE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock) for 5 minutes. Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, the American people have given our 45th President and the 115th Congress a clear mandate to revive our economy, secure our borders, restore our Nation's sovereignty, reinstate our Bill of Rights, and uphold the rule of law. Moreover, they have given us majorities in both Houses of Congress to do so. There is no excuse for failure. President Obama and Secretary Clinton set a positive tone for this peaceful transition of power, a tone no doubt shared by many Members of Congress and many Americans of good will who did not vote on the prevailing side. This represents the best of American statesmanship. Yet, we have also heard reactionary elements of the Democratic Party make a vicious pledge to thwart this mandate and destroy this President. One need look no further than Senator Reid's disgraceful diatribe on Friday to realize that these threats far exceed the lunatic fringe now violently rioting in our streets. {time} 1015 They reach directly into the Halls of Congress. To fulfill the mandate of the American people, we will need to deliberate wisely and in good faith, with all sides participating in the discussion and all voices heard. But, ultimately, those deliberations must result in laws to fulfill that mandate. The agenda is daunting, and time is fleeting. The greatest single obstacle to this era of reform is the 60-vote threshold to invoke cloture in the Senate, and I rise today to urge the Senate to finally reform it. Given the record of abuse of this rule and avowed intentions of many in that body, nothing will change legislatively unless the Senate Republican majority takes action when they organize in January. All the reforms that the American people called for, that the President will request, and that the House will pass will be stopped dead in the Senate. Now, I don't argue to abandon this rule, but rather to restore it to its original purpose. Cloture is rooted in a sound and ancient parliamentary principle that, as long as one-third of a deliberative body wants to debate an issue, that debate should continue. After all, a minority exists to convince the majority of its way of thinking. This is the essence of deliberation. But this principle assumes it is an actual debate where Members are talking to one another, and it requires that the debate be germane to the question at hand and that it is not dilatory. That is how cloture started. But over the 20th century, it degenerated into a 60-vote administrative threshold just to consider legislation. Ironically, a procedure designed to protect debate has now morphed into a procedure that very effectively prevents debate. The two Houses of Congress are designed to disagree with each other, but once the House and the Senate independently exercise their best judgment on a particular matter, there is a conference process developed over centuries to resolve their differences. This process cannot function if one House simply refuses to consider the other House's work. The modern notion of cloture prevents that process and the system breaks down. During the last several Congresses, the House has sent hundreds of bills--including the appropriations bills that fund this government--to the Senate; but instead of amending their ideas into those bills or sending us bills of their own, they have simply refused to consider them by a minority denying cloture. Now, some Senators have said that this mechanism is necessary to preserve collegiality and encourage compromise, but how can you have collegiality when one side simply refuses to talk to the other? How can you have compromise when the matter to be compromised cannot be taken up and discussed? Others have said that since most legislation grows the powers of government, it is an effective brake on that tendency. It is true this rule effectively blocks bad legislation. It also very effectively blocks good legislation that is necessary to reverse this trend. The current cloture rule provides a ratcheting effect that locks in every expansion of government over the past century. Now, some Republicans have said that it has been most useful when they have been in the minority. I have to ask them, do you want to be a successful majority or a successful minority? You cannot be both as long as cloture exists in its current form. Voters elected Republican majorities in both Houses of Congress, and they expect action. They will get it from the President and from the House. But in order for the Senate to rise to this occasion, it must reform its cloture rule when it organizes in January. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [House] [Page H6243] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE SENATE MUST REFORM CLOTURE The SPEAKER pro tempore.

All the reforms that the American people called for, that the President will request, and that the House will pass will be stopped dead in the Senate. Now, I don't argue to abandon this rule, but rather to restore it to its original purpose. Cloture is rooted in a sound and ancient parliamentary principle that, as long as one-third of a deliberative body wants to debate an issue, that debate should continue. After all, a minority exists to convince the majority of its way of thinking. This is the essence of deliberation. But this principle assumes it is an actual debate where Members are talking to one another, and it requires that the debate be germane to the question at hand and that it is not dilatory. That is how cloture started. But over the 20th century, it degenerated into a 60-vote administrative threshold just to consider legislation. Ironically, a procedure designed to protect debate has now morphed into a procedure that very effectively prevents debate. The two Houses of Congress are designed to disagree with each other, but once the House and the Senate independently exercise their best judgment on a particular matter, there is a conference process developed over centuries to resolve their differences. This process cannot function if one House simply refuses to consider the other House's work. The modern notion of cloture prevents that process and the system breaks down. During the last several Congresses, the House has sent hundreds of bills--including the appropriations bills that fund this government--to the Senate; but instead of amending their ideas into those bills or sending us bills of their own, they have simply refused to consider them by a minority denying cloture. Now, some Senators have said that this mechanism is necessary to preserve collegiality and encourage compromise, but how can you have collegiality when one side simply refuses to talk to the other? How can you have compromise when the matter to be compromised cannot be taken up and discussed? Others have said that since most legislation grows the powers of government, it is an effective brake on that tendency. It is true this rule effectively blocks bad legislation. It also very effectively blocks good legislation that is necessary to reverse this trend. The current cloture rule provides a ratcheting effect that locks in every expansion of government over the past century. Now, some Republicans have said that it has been most useful when they have been in the minority. I have to ask them, do you want to be a successful majority or a successful minority? You cannot be both as long as cloture exists in its current form. Voters elected Republican majorities in both Houses of Congress, and they expect action. They will get it from the President and from the House. But in order for the Senate to rise to this occasion, it must reform its cloture rule when it organizes in January. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [House] [Page H6243] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE SENATE MUST REFORM CLOTURE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock) for 5 minutes. Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, the American people have given our 45th President and the 115th Congress a clear mandate to revive our economy, secure our borders, restore our Nation's sovereignty, reinstate our Bill of Rights, and uphold the rule of law. Moreover, they have given us majorities in both Houses of Congress to do so. There is no excuse for failure. President Obama and Secretary Clinton set a positive tone for this peaceful transition of power, a tone no doubt shared by many Members of Congress and many Americans of good will who did not vote on the prevailing side. This represents the best of American statesmanship. Yet, we have also heard reactionary elements of the Democratic Party make a vicious pledge to thwart this mandate and destroy this President. One need look no further than Senator Reid's disgraceful diatribe on Friday to realize that these threats far exceed the lunatic fringe now violently rioting in our streets. {time} 1015 They reach directly into the Halls of Congress. To fulfill the mandate of the American people, we will need to deliberate wisely and in good faith, with all sides participating in the discussion and all voices heard. But, ultimately, those deliberations must result in laws to fulfill that mandate. The agenda is daunting, and time is fleeting.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. Ruiz) for 5 minutes. Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the lives of Palm Springs Officers Jose ``Gil'' Vega and Lesley Zerebny and to support the incredible law enforcement officers in my district. It is important to tell their story and forever record their heroism in our national Record. Officers Vega and Zerebny were, tragically, shot and killed in the line of duty last month while responding to what seemed like a routine domestic disturbance in Palm Springs, California. Officer Vega lived by the mantra of ``To Serve and Protect.'' He graduated from Indio High School and joined the force in Palm Springs in 1982. He was always witty, quick to tell a joke and to offer guidance to new officers. He was an inspiration to friends, family, and countless people who knew him. The day he died, he was only 2 months away from retiring after 35 years of service. He volunteered to pick up a shift on that day--on his day off. He is survived by his wife, Susana, nine children, and many grandchildren. Officer Lesley Zerebny was new to the force, with a lifetime of service. She showed a passion for law enforcement and service her entire life, no doubt inherited from her father, a California Highway Patrol officer. She was raised in Hemet, California, and attended West Valley High School. As a young girl, she always stood up to bullies to protect others and for justice. She was also known for her pranks and her fun-loving spirit. Officer Zerebny was a mother of a 4-month-old daughter, Cora. She had just returned from maternity leave when she was killed. She is survived by her husband Zack, a Riverside County Sheriff's Department officer, and by baby Cora. Officer Vega and Officer Zerebny were two of California's finest. Their lives of service and spirit of community embody the values of law enforcement officers across our great Nation. Each day, men and women like Lesley and Gil wake up, kiss their families good-bye, and go to work knowing full well the risks they take to keep us safe. Spouses, children, and parents wonder if they will ever return that day. Law enforcement officers see danger and they don't run from it; they run toward it to protect others. We are safer because of them. They and their families deserve our utmost gratitude for their service. So on behalf of the people of California's 36th Congressional District, my wife, Monica, and my family, I want to thank Officer Vega and Officer Zerebny and their families for their ultimate sacrifice. Our hearts are with you, and our hearts are with all law enforcement brothers and sisters during their time of mourning. We mourn with you, and we continue to offer our deepest gratitude for your service. Your dedication and the risks you take each and every day will never be forgotten.

CREC-2016-11-16-pt1-PgH6244,CREC-2016-11-16,114,HONORING THE MEMORY OF JAMES BARLOW,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [House] [Pages H6244-H6245] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE MEMORY OF JAMES BARLOW The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici) for 5 minutes. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of a dedicated teacher, mentor, and public servant, Mr. James Barlow. Many of us in public service can name a person who inspired us or clearly remember an experience that ignited our interest in the important issues that are shaped through politics and government. For thousands of Oregonians, that spark was Mr. Barlow. Born in Portland, Oregon, in 1929, Mr. Barlow earned his bachelor's and master's degrees from Oregon State University. He taught social studies in the Beaverton School District in Oregon's First Congressional District from 1962 until 2005. He always made his classrooms laboratories of curiosity. Some of his best lessons didn't take place in a classroom at all. They took place on the floor of the Model Presidential Nominating Conventions started by Mr. Barlow in the mid-1960s. Every 4 years for four decades, thousands of high school students from all over the State would gather, usually in Portland, from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. They would step into the role of State delegations, vote on platform issues, cast ballots for the nomination, and broker and negotiate with other delegations. They got ready for this by studying their assigned State's demography, history, politics, and economy. Mr. Barlow and his colleagues prepared the students for months, leading class discussions on candidates in the primaries, the American political landscape, and the intricacies of delegate math. Student participants had to be sharp and organized. I know this firsthand because my son participated in the 2004 Model Convention and took preparatory evening classes with Mr. Barlow at Portland State University. These Model Conventions were no simple class simulations. Major Presidential candidates came by and spoke to the crowd of student delegates. Robert Kennedy, Nelson Rockefeller, George McGovern, Hubert Humphrey, Jesse Jackson, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Michael Dukakis, and Bill Clinton all stopped by at a Model Convention as they campaigned ahead of Oregon's Presidential primaries. {time} 1030 The model conventions exemplified Mr. Barlow's leadership, enthusiasm, and imagination, but former students know that he also connected with and motivated his students in smaller, quieter ways as well. His psychology, philosophy, and current affairs courses were legendary at Aloha High School, where he spent most of his career. He inspired students to think beyond tests and essays, he challenged them to think critically, and he encouraged them to consider new perspectives on information they consumed. As a teacher, he saw the potential in every student. With his dry wit, his deep knowledge, and genuine enthusiasm for his subject matter, Mr. Barlow created a learning atmosphere where everyone felt, and everyone was, welcome and valuable. There was something that helped with the welcoming--doughnuts. Long before doughnuts became a craze in Portland, Mr. Barlow was bringing them to his classes and to his colleagues in the social studies office. He would announce: Coffee and doughnuts will be served in the starlight room. Now, there was no starlight room, but the phrase evoked a gracious and relaxed lounge space. The school year in the Portland metro area is typically rainy, and fall and winter school days often start before dawn, but his words and his treats were always a welcome pick-me-up. The day after Mr. Barlow's death, scores of his former students and colleagues observed ``coffee and doughnut day,'' going out for a sugary bite and a cup of coffee and posting pictures on social media. It was touching to all who knew him. The life and work of Mr. James Barlow matter also to those who never knew him. That is because he taught thousands of Oregonians to be active, engaged, and sharp-thinking participants in our democracy. Whether they went on to work in public service or not, and no matter what their party affiliation, the students of Mr. Barlow became better citizens because of his contributions. Mr. Speaker, I hope we can all be inspired by Jim Barlow's example as we serve in this remarkable House of Representatives. I offer my sincere condolences to his family, especially to his wife of 47 years, Susan, his former colleagues, and to the generations of students who mourn his loss.

The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici) for 5 minutes. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of a dedicated teacher, mentor, and public servant, Mr. James Barlow. Many of us in public service can name a person who inspired us or clearly remember an experience that ignited our interest in the important issues that are shaped through politics and government. For thousands of Oregonians, that spark was Mr. Barlow. Born in Portland, Oregon, in 1929, Mr. Barlow earned his bachelor's and master's degrees from Oregon State University. He taught social studies in the Beaverton School District in Oregon's First Congressional District from 1962 until 2005. He always made his classrooms laboratories of curiosity. Some of his best lessons didn't take place in a classroom at all. They took place on the floor of the Model Presidential Nominating Conventions started by Mr. Barlow in the mid-1960s. Every 4 years for four decades, thousands of high school students from all over the State would gather, usually in Portland, from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. They would step into the role of State delegations, vote on platform issues, cast ballots for the nomination, and broker and negotiate with other delegations. They got ready for this by studying their assigned State's demography, history, politics, and economy. Mr. Barlow and his colleagues prepared the students for months, leading class discussions on candidates in the primaries, the American political landscape, and the intricacies of delegate math. Student participants had to be sharp and organized. I know this firsthand because my son participated in the 2004 Model Convention and took preparatory evening classes with Mr. Barlow at Portland State University. These Model Conventions were no simple class simulations. Major Presidential candidates came by and spoke to the crowd of student delegates. Robert Kennedy, Nelson Rockefeller, George McGovern, Hubert Humphrey, Jesse Jackson, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Michael Dukakis, and Bill Clinton all stopped by at a Model Convention as they campaigned ahead of Oregon's Presidential primaries. {time} 1030 The model conventions exemplified Mr. Barlow's leadership, enthusiasm, and imagination, but former students know that he also connected with and motivated his students in smaller, quieter ways as well. His psychology, philosophy, and current affairs courses were legendary at Aloha High School, where he spent most of his career. He inspired students to think beyond tests and essays, he challenged them to think critically, and he encouraged them to consider new perspectives on information they consumed. As a teacher, he saw the potential in every student. With his dry wit, his deep knowledge, and genuine enthusiasm for his subject matter, Mr. Barlow created a learning atmosphere where everyone felt, and everyone was, welcome and valuable. There was something that helped with the welcoming--doughnuts. Long before doughnuts became a craze in Portland, Mr. Barlow was bringing them to his classes and to his colleagues in the social studies office. He would announce: Coffee and doughnuts will be served in the starlight room. Now, there was no starlight room, but the phrase evoked a gracious and relaxed lounge space. The school year in the Portland metro area is typically rainy, and fall and winter school days often start before dawn, but his words and his treats were always a welcome pick-me-up. The day after Mr. Barlow's death, scores of his former students and colleagues observed ``coffee and doughnut day,'' going out for a sugary bite and a cup of coffee and posting pictures on social media. It was touching to all who knew him. The life and work of Mr. James Barlow matter also to those who never knew him. That is because he taught thousands of Oregonians to be active, engaged, and sharp-thinking participants in our democracy. Whether they went on to work in public service or not, and no matter what their party affiliation, the students of Mr. Barlow became better citizens because of his contributions. Mr. Speaker, I hope we can all be inspired by Jim Barlow's example as we serve in this remarkable House of Representatives. I offer my sincere condolences to his family, especially to his wife of 47 years, Susan, his former colleagues, and to the generations of students who mourn his loss.

Mr. Speaker, I have been on the floor so many times over the last year or so talking about the 16 [[Page H6244]] years of war in Afghanistan and the waste of money, but, more importantly, the waste of life. The titles that I am going to share with the House today have appeared in October and November in articles, national articles, about the failed policy in Afghanistan. I would like to share those very quickly. ``U.S. Pledges Another $800 Million to Afghanistan Despite Rampant Corruption.'' ``Four Americans Die in Suicide Blast At U.S. Base in Afghanistan; 17 Others Wounded.'' These are headlines, Mr. Speaker. ``Latest Afghan Attack Raises Perplexing Questions on Security.'' Another title: ``The U.S. Spent Billions Building Roads in Afghanistan. Now Many of Them Are Beyond Repair.'' Another title: ``Inspector General: Pentagon Must Explain Afghan `Ghost Soldier' Problems. Funding for Afghan Military Wasted on Non- Existent Soldiers.'' Mr. Speaker, 200,000 Afghanistan ghosts that the taxpayers of America have been paying for their services, and they don't even exist. When I read that, I wrote a letter to the Defense Secretary, Ash Carter, and I said to Secretary Carter: Please explain how much money did we pay to the ghosts that don't even exist? How long have we been paying the ghosts that don't exist? We are talking about 200,000 Afghan soldiers that don't even exist. Mr. Speaker, I do not understand why the House of Representatives does not have a debate on our policy regarding Afghanistan. How much longer can a nation that is $19.8 trillion in debt--that is America, $19.8 trillion in debt--and how many more billions of dollars can we keep putting into the black hole of Afghanistan and keep losing our young men and women in a country that is never going to change? It goes back to Alexander the Great. It goes back to the British. It goes back to the Russians. Anyone who has ever gone into that country known as Afghanistan has eventually left, and they knew there was nothing they could change. Not America, though. We have been there 16 years. We don't even debate it on the floor of the House. We will be passing a DOD funding bill pretty soon, and there will be billions of dollars going to Afghanistan and there will be very little debate on it. There are those on the Democratic side and the Republican side, Mr. Speaker, who do care about our troops, who do care about the wasted money, and who do care about a policy that has no end to it. It is not fair to our men and women in uniform. They deserve better from this Congress. It is our constitutional duty that we debate policy that sends our young men and women to die. Yet we do not debate it. It just goes on and on. This poster that I brought with me today, Mr. Speaker, before I close, I have signed over 11,000 letters to families and extended families who have lost loved ones in Afghanistan and Iraq. Recently, we have had seven Americans killed in Afghanistan. I do not understand why we are so void of a debate. James Madison would have been very disappointed, Mr. Speaker. It was Madison who said that it is the legislative branch that will debate and vote on war, not the executive branch. But we have abdicated our responsibility to the President and let the President decide what the foreign policy should be and how we should use our men and women in uniform. That is a sad day for America. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the House for this time. I close by asking God to please bless our men and women in uniform, to please bless the families of our men and women in uniform and hold in His loving arms those young Americans who have given their life for this country.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize two friends, two Members of the Pennsylvania delegation, here in the House, Representative Joe Pitts and Representative Mike Fitzpatrick, on their upcoming retirements and for their service to this Nation and to their constituents. It has been an honor to serve with both of these gentlemen over the past 8 years. Representative Pitts' retirement caps a long career of service to his Nation. His career started as an educator, teaching math, science, English, physical education, along with coaching basketball. He also served 5\1/2\ years in the United States Air Force with three tours in Vietnam. After being commissioned as a second lieutenant, he was promoted to the rank of captain by the time he left the service. After settling in Pennsylvania, Representative Pitts continued to teach until he felt the call of public service, launching a 24-year career as a Pennsylvania State representative, and serving as chairman of the Committee on Labor Relations and later of the Appropriations Committee. Joe was sworn in as a United States Representative in January of 1997, the beginning of a 20-year career here in Washington, D.C., and in serving the residents of Pennsylvania's 16th Congressional District. His ten terms here in the House of Representatives have included time spent chairing multiple subcommittees, including the Health Subcommittee for his last two terms here in Congress. I have greatly enjoyed time spent with Joe during our weekly Bible studies, and I wish him and his wife, Ginny, the best of luck in retirement. I also want to recognize the retirement of my friend and colleague, Representative Mike Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania's Eighth Congressional District. Like Representative Pitts, Mike has dedicated much of his life to public service and was first elected in 1995 as a Bucks County commissioner, a position he served in for 10 years. During that time, he showed a commitment to bringing jobs to Bucks County, Pennsylvania, creating the county's first enterprise zone, which eventually created thousands of local jobs. Mike arrived in Washington, D.C., as the representative of the Commonwealth's Eighth Congressional District in January of 2005 and later worked to bring the national veterans' cemetery to Bucks County. More recently, he has served as the chairman of the Task Force to Investigate Terrorism Financing. Personally, I have bonded with Mike over our shared ties to the Boy Scouts of America. We are both longtime Boy Scouts and fellow Eagle Scouts. Mike's service to scouting includes time spent as president of the Bucks County Council of the Boy Scouts of America. I wish Representative Mike Fitzpatrick a great retirement, along with his wife, Kathy, and their children. Congratulations, Joe and Mike.

During that time, he showed a commitment to bringing jobs to Bucks County, Pennsylvania, creating the county's first enterprise zone, which eventually created thousands of local jobs. Mike arrived in Washington, D.C., as the representative of the Commonwealth's Eighth Congressional District in January of 2005 and later worked to bring the national veterans' cemetery to Bucks County. More recently, he has served as the chairman of the Task Force to Investigate Terrorism Financing. Personally, I have bonded with Mike over our shared ties to the Boy Scouts of America. We are both longtime Boy Scouts and fellow Eagle Scouts. Mike's service to scouting includes time spent as president of the Bucks County Council of the Boy Scouts of America. I wish Representative Mike Fitzpatrick a great retirement, along with his wife, Kathy, and their children. Congratulations, Joe and Mike. It has been an honor serving with you. ____________________",package_114_207.csv,3261,3261,3335,"[congressional record volume 162, number 164 (wednesday, november 16, 2016)] [house] [page h6245] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] recognizing the retirements of representatives joe pitts and mike fitzpatrick the speaker pro tempore. the chair recognizes the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. thompson) for 5 minutes. mr. thompson of pennsylvania. mr. speaker, i rise today to recognize two friends, two members of the pennsylvania delegation, here in the house, representative joe pitts and representative mike fitzpatrick, on their upcoming retirements and for their service to this nation and to their constituents. it has been an honor to serve with both of these gentlemen over the past 8 years. representative pitts' retirement caps a long career of service to his nation. his career started as an educator, teaching math, science, english, physical education, along with coaching basketball. he also served 5\1/2\ years in the united states air force with three tours in vietnam. after being commissioned as a second lieutenant, he was promoted to the rank of captain by the time he left the service. after settling in pennsylvania, representative pitts continued to teach until he felt the call of public service, launching a 24-year career as a pennsylvania state representative, and serving as chairman of the committee on labor relations and later of the appropriations committee. joe was sworn in as a united states representative in january of 1997, the beginning of a 20-year career here in washington, d.c., and in serving the residents of pennsylvania's 16th congressional district. his ten terms here in the house of representatives have included time spent chairing multiple subcommittees, including the health subcommittee for his last two terms here in congress. i have greatly enjoyed time spent with joe during our weekly bible studies, and i wish him and his wife, ginny, the best of luck in retirement. i also want to recognize the retirement of my friend and colleague, representative mike fitzpatrick of pennsylvania's eighth congressional district. like representative pitts, mike has dedicated much of his life to public service and was first elected in 1995 as a bucks county commissioner, a position he served in for 10 years. during that time, he showed a commitment to bringing jobs to bucks county, pennsylvania, creating the county's first enterprise zone, which eventually created thousands of local jobs. mike arrived in washington, d.c., as the representative of the commonwealth's eighth congressional district in january of 2005 and later worked to bring the national veterans' cemetery to bucks county. more recently, he has served as the chairman of the task force to investigate terrorism financing. personally, i have bonded with mike over our shared ties to the boy scouts of america. we are both longtime boy scouts and fellow eagle scouts. mike's service to scouting includes time spent as president of the bucks county council of the boy scouts of america. i wish representative mike fitzpatrick a great retirement, along with his wife, kathy, and their children. congratulations, joe and mike. it has been an honor serving with you. ____________________",3261

The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner) for 5 minutes. Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Midnight Rules Relief Act, which would halt President Obama's ability to rush through politically motivated regulations during the remainder of his term. It is clear that this administration will do everything possible to stop President-elect Donald Trump by jamming through as many backdoor regulations as possible before the clock runs out. Last week, the American people spoke. They made it clear that they want to get our economy moving again. President-elect Trump must have the opportunity to enact policies without regulatory hindrance from the previous administration. Mr. Speaker, since taking office, the President has ignored Article I of the Constitution and the will of the American people. For the past 8 years, the President has used his pen and phone to create a fourth branch of government, imposing executive orders and Federal rules and regulations to benefit his own radical political agenda. In 2015 alone, the Federal Government implemented 3,400 regulations on Americans that cost us $1.89 trillion in lost productivity and growth--a cost that averages nearly $15,000 per American household. These regulations from unelected, unaccountable government bureaucrats are unfair and unjust. Mr. Speaker, my constituents in Missouri are desperate for greater security and economic opportunity. This comes with elevating, not undermining, the spirit of self-governance for which our Nation was founded. As a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives--the people's House--we must pass the Midnight Rules Relief Act to ensure that we are protecting the American people from reckless regulations that will continue to cripple our economy and target the pocketbooks of all Americans. Transparency is critical when we pass important legislation that will directly affect our constituents. If the President has the ability to impose major regulations without the necessary time for congressional scrutiny and oversight, we are not doing our jobs to represent and protect our constituents. Mr. Speaker, I have spent my time in Congress fighting for our families, fighting to repeal regulations that are hindering business growth, and fighting to provide a voice for the voiceless. It is our duty to pass this legislation and continue to fight against the President's irresponsible agenda and give our new President, Donald Trump, the support that he has earned. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [House] [Page H6245] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MIDNIGHT RULES RELIEF ACT The SPEAKER pro tempore.

As executive chairman of Breitbart News, Mr. Bannon repeatedly and aggressively pushed stories that promote anti-Semitism, xenophobia, and racism. During an interview last summer, Mr. Bannon bragged that Breitbart was ``the platform for the alt-right,'' a movement that upholds White nationalism while strongly rejecting diversity in any form. Under his leadership, Breitbart has referred to a leading Republican columnist as a renegade Jew. He suggested that young Muslims in the West are a ticking time bomb. He declared that the Confederate flag proclaims a glorious heritage, and he praised the alt-right as a smarter version of old-school racist skinheads.

Dennis was not only a law enforcement officer, but also a coach and a mentor and a friend to many of these young individuals. Dennis has received countless awards and commendations for his outstanding service to our community. The outpouring of support from Stanislaus County and our State reflects the love for our fallen hero. Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring the life of Deputy Dennis Wallace, who defended and protected our community until his last breath. He made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. My deepest sympathy goes out to the Stanislaus County Sheriff's Department, the Wallace family, and his many loved ones. God bless him always.

During the Cubs' championship 2016 season, Travis posted a 4-0 record with a 2.95 ERA in 77 appearances. Congratulations on a great season, and I look forward to following your continued success.

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Rodney Davis of Illinois). The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. {time} 1230 General Leave Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous materials on House Resolution 921, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring this rule forward on behalf of the Rules Committee. The rule provides for the consideration of H.R. 5711, to prohibit the Secretary of the Treasury from authorizing certain transactions by a U.S. financial institution in connection with the export or re-export of a commercial passenger aircraft to the Islamic Republic of Iran. The rule also provides for the consideration of H.R. 5982, the Midnight Rules Relief Act. The rule provides for 1 hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by the chair and the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. It also provides a motion to recommit. Additionally, the bill provides for 1 hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Financial Services Committee, with a motion to recommit. On Monday, the Rules Committee heard testimony from the chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, Bob Goodlatte; from Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law Subcommittee Ranking Member Hank Johnson; and from the chairman of the Committee on Financial Services, Jeb Hensarling, and Congressman Denny Heck. H.R. 5982, the Midnight Rules Relief Act, was marked up and reported by the Judiciary Committee, and it enjoyed discussion at the committee level. The rule also combines H.R. 5715, the No Ex-Im Assistance for Terrorism Act, with H.R. 5711. Both of these bills were approved by the House Financial Services Committee in July. The rule makes in order five amendments to H.R. 5982 from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, and it makes in order the only amendment submitted on H.R. 5711. I am a cosponsor of the Midnight Rules Relief Act, which was authored by my friend Darrell Issa of California. This bill addresses a problem that we have seen far too often in the administrations of both parties. As the President's term draws to a close, we have come to expect a raft of new regulations to be forced upon the American people. We usually see an even greater jump in the number of regulations during the lameduck period, which is between election day and Inauguration Day. These hurried rules--midnight rules--are too often used to force the political agenda of an outgoing administration on hardworking Americans as a last-ditch attempt to implement partisan priorities. As we enter a lameduck period after last week's election, this is a particularly meaningful time to consider this legislation. I think we can agree, regardless of party, the outgoing administrations should not be rushing to impose burdensome regulations on the American people. Already, we have seen the Obama administration issue numerous midnight rules, including multiple billion-dollar rules. In fact, this administration has issued or plans to issue at least 180 such rules. Just yesterday, we were presented with a clear example of this problem when the Department of the Interior announced the finalization of a new rule on methane venting and flaring. This rule was announced by the Bureau of Land Management in an attempt to lower output despite the costs it will impose on energy production and on numerous State regulations already in place. This is just one example of an administration's rushing to finalize rules to cement a partisan policy agenda. We have seen this administration increase the regulatory burden on families and businesses by more than $100 billion. The last thing we should do is let them further that burden in the waning days of a lameduck Presidency. However, despite the clear evidence that the current administration is taking advantage of the ability to implement midnight rules, this is not a problem that is unique to only one political party. Lameduck regulations have been abused by both parties, but addressing this issue will help rein in that practice and ensure that Congress can exercise proper oversight authority. The Midnight Rules Relief Act would take steps to solve the problem by amending the Congressional Review Act to provide congressional authority to allow CRA resolutions that disapprove multiple midnight resolutions [[Page H6250]] en bloc. Currently, the CRA can only be used for individual regulations. The amended Congressional Review Act would maintain flexibility while incentivizing outgoing administrations to avoid issuing broad and controversial midnight regulations. The rule before us today also provides for the consideration of a different but equally important bill. H.R. 5711 takes critical steps to protect taxpayers and national security. Under the Iran nuclear deal, which I vocally opposed, President Obama agreed to license the exports of commercial planes. Recently, the Treasury Department authorized the sale of almost 100 planes for Iran. I can't believe this is even something we have to talk about here today, but it is a deeply serious issue. The administration has allowed the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism to receive U.S. financing and planes. H.R. 5711 takes the commonsense step of prohibiting the Secretary of the Treasury from authorizing U.S. financing in connection with the export of commercial passenger aircraft to Iran. It also makes permanent the financing prohibition for the Export-Import Bank assistance to the Government of Iran. I will say it again: this is just simply common sense. We should not and cannot be in the business of licensing the financing and sale of aircraft to a country that wishes to do us harm. The underlying bills that this rule provides consideration for are necessary to protect the American people and to restore smart policies that will protect us both here and abroad. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank my colleague from Georgia for yielding the customary time. The legislation before us today continues the majority's attempts to undermine the actions taken by President Obama. H.R. 5711 would force us to violate our international obligations under the Iran nuclear agreement, which was painstakingly negotiated by Secretary of State John Kerry, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, and Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz with the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, plus Germany. I think this is a great mistake by the United States to think that we will undermine it and that we have the ability to do that. It is very unlikely, in any event, that should this be undermined and this treaty be overturned that we could put that back together with the same group of people who negotiated it in the first place. In the process, it would put aircraft manufacturers here at home at a competitive disadvantage with their foreign competitors--something I am very much surprised that the majority would even contemplate. This legislation would also continue their attacks on the Export- Import Bank, an economic driver that has helped to create jobs and to grow our economy by expanding American businesses' access to foreign markets. These attacks stand in stark contrast to the Export-Import Bank's long history of bipartisan support, including from Presidents all the way back to John Kennedy and Bill Clinton and to Republican Presidents like Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. Mr. Speaker, instead of advancing this misguided legislation, this Chamber should be supporting our local businesses and the good-paying jobs that they create. The majority should also give the Iran nuclear agreement the time to succeed instead of rushing forward with this bill that would already put the U.S. in direct violation of it. As I said earlier, if this agreement fails, we would not likely be able to reapply the sanctions or get the support of the Security Council. If we want to achieve our goal of ensuring that Iran is unable to build a nuclear weapon, this agreement remains the best available option for peacefully and verifiably cutting off its pathways. The second bill we are considering today, H.R. 5982, is a sad continuation of the majority's attempts to delegitimize any actions taken by President Obama. This time, the majority is trying to amend the Congressional Review Act and allow Congress to invalidate regulations en bloc that are proposed in the final 60 legislative days of the President's term. That means that potentially lifesaving measures could be repealed in the blink of an eye without there being any proper evaluation or examination of their impacts. Mr. Speaker, the taxpayers expect reasonable and thoughtful governance. They also expect us to uphold the Constitution, which clearly states that Presidents have 4-year terms. That means that President Obama is President of the United States for a full 4-year term, not a 3\3/4\-year term. It is a disgrace that President Obama couldn't even get a hearing on his Supreme Court nominee, Judge Merrick Garland. This unprecedented dereliction of the majority's responsibilities is symbolic of its failure to respect this President. So many issues deserve our attention in the closing days of Congress, and it is disappointing to me and to so many others that the majority has chosen to prioritize measures--that won't even be considered in the Senate--just to take parting political shots at President Obama. We were elected to get things done, Mr. Speaker, and these bills are really just solutions in search of problems that don't exist. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I do understand that, yes, our Presidents are elected for a full 4 years. I have no problem with that. What I do have a problem with, though, is trying to push bills that cannot make it through these bodies in the proper way and with the proper oversight that Congress is supposed to have. We are set up in Article I of the Constitution as the body that makes the laws and sets the policy, along with Executive who carries out that policy. What we are simply saying is: don't go around what you can't get done in Congress and try to do it before you walk out the door. I understand that this is both sides, Mr. Speaker. This is not just this administration; it has been used by both. It just needs to stop. Congress has a role; the Executive has a role; the judiciary has a role. That is why the Founders put it together. This is simply saying: let's do it the right way. Also, just as a quick note on this issue of the planes to Iran, as a member of the military currently and also as one who served in Iraq, this is very concerning to me on many levels. Also, the problem that we see with Iran is not about not doing business--it is about the protection of American interests and American assets. In fact, this is a bipartisan issue. One of the Financial Services Committee members from across the aisle, Mr. Sherman, actually opposed this, but he actually said this--and it really makes a lot of sense. He said: Until Iran Air gets out of the business of supporting terrorism and supporting Assad's regime in Syria, the United States should not license the sale of aircraft to Iran Air. It is virtually certain that Iran Air will use these aircraft for nefarious purposes. We are just saying: put our country in a safe position. We are not talking about denying business, but we are talking about what many of us feel was a very bad decision with the Iran nuclear deal and about, simply here, just putting us back in an Article I position. I appreciate the gentlewoman from New York. I think we just need to do our business and just put our interests first, not only here, but also abroad. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer). Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentlewoman's courtesy in permitting me to speak on this, and I appreciate the statement that she just made a moment ago in opposing the rule. Mr. Speaker, I want to focus on just one area, which is H.R. 5711, designed to prohibit the transaction with Iran. I couldn't agree more with my friend on the other side of the aisle, who is managing this issue for the Republicans, in that we ought to put America's interests first. That is why the overwhelming majority of independent experts agreed with the Comprehensive Joint Plan of Action, which was designed to make it harder and less likely that Iran would develop nuclear weapons. Now, who is going to forget Benjamin Netanyahu before us and others who [[Page H6251]] were hysterical that Iran was just months away from a nuclear breakout and the threat that that posed? I, for one, agree that I don't want Iran to have nuclear weapons. I think that would be horrific. It is wrong to put nuclear weapons in their hands with the other cascading effects that could occur if they were to obtain nuclear weapons. That is why the United States--Secretary Kerry--and five other countries worked with us to use the power of our sanctions and international cooperation to make that nuclear breakout less likely. And what has happened since that agreement was signed and entered into? As a practical matter, Iran has complied with what it said it would do, and that nuclear threshold for Iran's having the potential of generating nuclear weapons has grown longer. They have reduced the number of centrifuges--less nuclear fissile material. This is what we wanted, and they have done it. {time} 1245 To this point, they have complied. We have complied, for example, by giving them back their own money that was frozen as a result of the events of the Iranian Revolution. This avenue of trying to undermine the agreement--and make no mistake, Republican leadership and a Trump administration is likely to try to overturn it altogether--will continue a pattern of mismanagement by the United States of our relationship with one of the oldest civilizations in the Middle East. This goes back over 3,000 years. Iranians are not Arabs. They are Persians. They have their own interests, their own identity. It is twice as large as Iraq and Afghanistan, more populous, more sophisticated. Pretending that we are going to attack them, as some of the people that Mr. Trump is considering for key positions have favored, would be a nightmare. Remember, the United States overthrew the popularly elected leader of Iran, working with the British in 1953, and installed the Shah on the throne. The United States sided with Saddam Hussein, who we thought was so evil that we upset the order in the Middle East and undertook that disastrous war. We sided with him as he used weapons of mass destruction against the Iranians. Now, who would blame the Iranians, given our history, for not being friendly toward the United States? The fact is--and it can be verified by friends of yours who may have visited Iran--that it is actually the country whose people have the most positive feelings toward the United States. After 9-11, there were candlelight vigils in Tehran in sympathy with Americans who were attacked. Now, many people have a cartoon image of the Iranian situation. It is complex. There are some very bad people in power in Iran, and we need to stand up to them. Many of those people want this deal to fail, just like some hardliners in the United States want it to fail. I don't think we should serve their interests. Preventing the United States to follow through on this agreement, for example, with enabling them to purchase Boeing planes, not giving us over $17 billion in business, not putting over 100,000 Americans to work and building relationships, I think, is foolish. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, in fact, if the agreement falls apart and the sanctions collapse, they will get their planes. They will just buy Airbus planes, not Boeing. Most importantly, we will be undermining an opportunity to use diplomacy to make the world safer. I have been appalled how difficult it is for us to focus on the big picture. Absolutely push back at some of the bad guys. Stand up to problems that they create. We just reinstituted the sanctions against misbehavior by Iran, and I voted for that yesterday. But don't undermine an agreement that is working--Iran has already got much of what they wanted out of this deal. If we undermine it, they can walk away. They have got some money, and they can have world opinion on their side and go ahead and develop nuclear weapons. That is crazy. We ought to abide by our agreements. We ought to stand up to them where they are wrong. We ought to promote interaction where we can. We ought to work with the very vibrant Iranian American community, which I hope Donald Trump doesn't deport. They are law-abiding, very effective citizens in the United States. We ought to be working with them to work for the cause of international peace, strengthening the American economy while we make all of us make nuclear weapons less likely and strengthen international cooperation. It was a signal achievement to have China, Russia, Germany, Great Britain, and France work with us on this agreement. We should not undercut it. We should honor it. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up a bill that would prohibit lobbyists from serving on President-elect Trump's transition team. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from New York? There was no objection. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, these bills will be going nowhere in the Senate, and we should be happy about that. We shouldn't be frittering away the closing days of this session of Congress with legislation designed to delegitimize the work of our President. There are major issues that face our country that the American people are crying out for us to address, from our crumbling infrastructure to the skyrocketing cost of education. We were elected to solve these problems, Mr. Speaker. These bills, again, utterly fail to do anything about any of that. Our constituents deserve more; the taxpayers deserve more. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I appreciate a good debate. This rule actually deals with two. One is the midnight rule, which again has been abused by both sides. Also, as it was just spoken of on the floor, there is this issue of the funds for the planes for Iran. Let me just say, I would love to go back and discuss the Iran deal that was put into place. I have been on this floor many times opposing that deal. We can talk about it. I don't think it was ever put into place to stop. Actually, there is this issue that they have complied. I just find it laughable that they have complied. They have tested rockets. They have sent people overseas. They have not complied with this. There is one thing that I agree with that the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) said just a moment ago. I agree with him when he said: Yes, Iran has got everything they want. They have got the money. They keep going. Their centrifuges are spinning. I will just say this about this issue right here: If we could actually look at this, I will support Iran when Iran is willing to be a part of the world culture and starts recognizing Israel's right to exist. I will support Iran when they are signing their agreement and not shouting ``death to America.'' Let's play on a level playing field. I have got no problem with that. We are not debating that. Unfortunately, that is the deal the next administration can deal with. At least, I will have some sympathy for them when they quit breaking the very agreement we are saying that they are honoring. I just can't see that. So these funds, I don't want them used. There are assets that we have. They are military assets. They are my brothers and sisters in arms right now who are all over the world that could be impacted by this. So as we go forward, this is a commonsense rule for two reasons. We are not going to use the bank accounts of Americans to buy planes for Iran that can be used against us in a war. We are not going to have midnight rules by both parties. It doesn't matter which party here. This is Article I, this is basic Constitution. Let the Congress do its work, not a President carrying out an agenda. [[Page H6252]] These are important bills that make smart, commonsense policy changes to protect Americans. For that reason, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation provided for by the rule and the rule itself. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on the Rule for H.R. 5711, the ``Block U.S. Financing for Iranian Aircraft Purchases,'' and H.R. 5982, the ``Midnight Rules Relief Act of 2016.'' I thank Chairman Sessions and Chairwoman Slaughter for their work in bringing this Rule before the House for consideration. I would like to thank the Rules Committee for making my amendment in order for H.R. 5982, the ``Midnight Rule Relief Act,'' which exempts any rule promulgated to prevent, respond to, or mitigate matters of critical national security. H.R. 5711, is in direct violation of a provision of the Iran Nuclear Agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA would be undermined by passage of this bill. The Administration has issued a veto threat on the bill, stating in part, ``This bill, if enacted, would contravene U.S. commitments in the JCPOA and interfere with its successful implementation. H.R. 5711 would prohibit the Secretary of the Treasury from authorizing transactions by the U.S. financial institutions in connection with the export and re-export of passenger aircraft made prior to enactment of the bill. The United States has a long tradition of remaining faithful to our commitments and our international partners, and a reversal of this principle undercuts our credibility, diminishes our ability to lead globally, and threatens the very alliances we rely upon in implementing the JCPOA. We can anticipate that should this bill become law our closest allies would view this bill as a violation of our JCPOA commitments and Iran would take the issue to the Joint Commission.'' In June, it was disclosed that Boeing had a Memorandum of Agreement with Iran Air for the sale of 80 commercial passenger planes. In September, the Treasury Department then issued a license for the sale of all 80 of these Boeing planes to Iran Air. The license also authorized U.S. financial institutions to engage in all transactions necessary to provide financing or other financial services to effectuate the sale of the Boeing planes. This bill prohibits the involvement of U.S. financial institutions in the sale of commercial passenger aircraft to Iran Air, and would put U.S. aircraft manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage with their foreign competitors, whose access to financing would not be subject to the same constraints. This will translate into jobs lost in the United States. Promises to bring jobs in October, but working to put people out of work in November is not what the public wants or expects of Congress. Complaints about Iran have access to $50 billion of unfrozen oil escrow funds as a result of the JCPOA and charging that this $50 billion could be redirected to Iran's destabilizing activities in the region is now preventing some of those funds from coming to a U.S. company that would create jobs here at home. This GOP bill would PREVENT Iran from spending well over $50 billion on commercial passenger aircraft from Boeing and other manufacturers as well as on air infrastructure improvements. This Congress has much to do with in the 13 days of official business remaining. The 114th Congress has to complete work on: 11 of the 12 House Appropriations bills; Criminal Justice Reform; Funding for the Flint Water Crisis; Restoring the Voting Rights Act; Protecting children with disabilities access to public education; Immigration Reform; Funding for the Louisiana Flooding; Funding for the damage caused by Hurricane Matthew; and Cybersecurity of the Nation's Critical Infrastructure. It is beyond shocking and unacceptable that tens of thousands of citizens living in Flint Michigan have been exposed to toxic levels of lead in their drinking water. Not only will the dangers and hazards of this disaster be felt by the residents of Flint Michigan for years to come, but the American public remains at risk to national security vulnerabilities exposed through our most basic infrastructure that supports the delivery of clean water to homes and businesses nationwide. The trust and ability to protect our citizens' basic right to clean water has been shaken, while the leadership of this Congress does nothing. We all have a duty to ensure justice and protection of our citizens. Criminal Justice Reform is a pressing issue that Congress must address. As Judge Learned Hand observed, ``If we are to keep our democracy, there must be one commandment: thou shalt not ration justice.'' Reforming the criminal justice system so that it is fairer and delivers equal justice to all persons is one of the great moral imperatives of our time. For reform to be truly meaningful, we must look at every stage at which our citizens interact with the system--from policing in our communities and the first encounter with law enforcement, to the charging and manner of attaining a conviction, from the sentence imposed to reentry and collateral consequences. House Democrats, led by House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member John Conyers of Michigan and me, as Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations, have accepted and embraced the challenge of reforming the criminal justice system and developed many innovative legislative remedies to correct many of the most glaring inequities and racial disparities in the most critical areas of the system. This is an important topic and one that Congress must turn its attention to with urgency and unity of effort to: address the harms caused; get an accounting of what happened; understand how the water was poisoned; make the lives of people damaged by this tragedy whole; find justice for those lives that may have been lost; and determine and provide for the long-term health needs of those impacted. Today, the water in Flint, Michigan is not safe to drink and we have no concrete answer on when it may be safe to drink in the future. Flint, Michigan like so many communities across the nation really felt the brunt of the financial crisis created by the abuse of new home lending practices and deceptive investment schemes that hid the weaknesses in the economy until the great recession spread across the nation beginning in late 2008. The financial damage done to communities like Flint in the form of steep declines in property values, which caused significant declines in property tax income. This was not just Flint's problem, but a national reality--for financially strapped cities, towns, school boards, and municipal governments who rely on Congress to fund all 12 Congressional appropriations bills to provide them with much needed revenue to meet the needs of their citizens. In the 51 years since its passage on August 6, 1965, the Voting Rights Act has safeguarded the right of Americans to vote and stood as an obstacle to many of the more egregious attempts by certain states and local jurisdictions to game the system by passing discriminatory changes to their election laws or administrative policies. In signing the Voting Rights Act on August 6, 1965, President Lyndon Johnson said: `The vote is the most powerful instrument ever devised by man for breaking down injustice and destroying the terrible walls which imprison men because they are different from other men.' But on June 25, 2013, the Supreme Court decided Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 193 (2013), which invalidated Section 4(b) of the VRA, and paralyzed the application of the VRA's Section 5 preclearance requirements, which protect minority voting rights where voter discrimination has historically been the worst. Since 1982, Section 5 has stopped more than 1,000 discriminatory voting changes in their tracks, including 107 discriminatory changes in Texas. Although much progress has been made with regard to Civil Rights there is still much work to be done in order to prevent systemic voter suppression and discrimination within our communities and we must remain ever vigilant and oppose schemes that will abridge or dilute the precious right to vote. H.R. 885, `Voting Rights Amendments Act of 2015,' of which I am an original co-sponsor, repairs the damage done to the Voting Rights Act by the Supreme Court decision and is capable of winning majorities in the House and Senate and the signature of the President. For millions of Americans, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is sacred treasure, earned by the sweat and toil and tears and blood of ordinary Americans who showed the world it was possible to accomplish extraordinary things. The Voting Rights Act is needed as much today to prevent another epidemic of voting disenfranchisement as Dr. Salk's vaccine is still needed to prevent another polio epidemic and I am calling again for Speaker Boehner to bring H.R. 885, `Voting Rights Amendments Act of 2015' to the floor for a vote this year. As of October 3, 2016 the Texas Education Agency has 30 days to respond to an order by the U.S. Department of Education to fix its terribly broken system that serves special needs children. Because the arbitrary cap limiting the number of special needs students enrolled in a [[Page H6253]] school district set and enforced by TEA clearly violated both the letter and spirit of the IDEA Act, on September 12, 2016, I wrote Education Secretary John King to demand that the U.S. Department of Education ``review, investigate, and take immediate and appropriate action to remedy the injury currently being suffered at least 250,000 special needs school children resulting from the systematic and intentional actions of the Texas state government to deprive these students of the rights guaranteed them by the 1990 Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA Act).'' Hubert Humphrey once said that the ``moral test of government is how it treats: those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the aged; and those in the shadows of life, the sick, the needy and the handicapped.'' By this measure, the Texas state government has been failing the moral test for more than a decade when it comes to fair treatment of special needs students. This should not have happened in Texas and we must act to be sure that it is not happening in other states. Across the nation, approximately 13% of school children receive the special education benefits guaranteed by the IDEA Act. In Texas, however, the comparable figure is 8.5%, by far the lowest of any state in the nation. If the level of service provided by the State of Texas even barely met the national average, an additional 250,000 special need students would be receiving the educational opportunity they desperately need and deserve. As I document in my letter to Education Secretary King, ``the real- world consequence of this deplorable decision is that vital supports to children with autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, dyslexia, epilepsy, mental illnesses, speech impediments, traumatic brain injuries, even blindness and deafness, are being denied to approximately 250,000 Texas children.'' When a school district, for example, ignores a mother's request for a special education evaluation, the emotional and psychological damage inflicted on her child who may be forced to repeat the second and third grade is incalculable and may be irreparable. My thoughts and prayers continue to be with the with the people of Louisiana who were adversely affected by the historic 1,000 year flooding event that has devastated the Baton Rouge area of Louisiana. This disaster is the latest reminder of the vulnerabilities posed by extreme weather events faced by people living along the Gulf Coast. The National Weather Service reported 21.86 inches of rain falling within 48 hours caused levees to overtop and rivers to breach their banks. Global climate change cares not if you believe in it; the force of nature will do its will at the expense, pain and suffering of our nation's citizens. This Congress is about to end its business without taking care of the people of Louisiana devastated by the floods earlier this year. On Oct. 7 in Florida, a peak surge of 9.88 feet above normal was measured at a tide gauge at Fernandina Beach, Florida. Storm surge flooding affected the St. Augustine area, including major flooding on Anastasia Island where water was reported to be 2.5 feet above ground level. To the south in nearby Flagler Beach, Florida, parts of A1A were washed out by the storm surge. The Northwestern-Jacksonville conducted a storm survey and found a new inlet was carved between Marineland and Matanzas Inlet, between Palm Coast and St. Augustine Beach, Florida. The St. Johns River in northeast Florida reached its highest level on record at Shands Bridge, along with 3 to 4.3 feet of storm surge inundation reported at the Racy Point, Red Bay Point and 1-295 bridge tide gauges. Early in the morning on Oct. 8, the St. Johns River was flowing backwards. Matthew's storm surge coupled with high tide lead to a record tide level at Ft. Pulaski, Georgia, early Oct. 8, and storm surge inundation roughly waist-deep was reported in parts of Charleston, South Carolina. We also should not forget Hurricane Matthew--what it did to Haiti and parts of the Southern United States requires Congressional attention to relieve people who are suffering. Even before Hurricane Matthew struck, more than a quarter of Haiti's 11 million people lived in extreme poverty, surviving on less than $1.25 a day. Haiti's people once again, in their great sorrow, need our prayers, our generosity, and our compassion. Much of what the people of Haiti have worked and fought tirelessly for over the last few years has been wiped out in this the third major natural disaster since 2010'S ruthless earthquake. Because of Hurricane Matthew hundreds of thousands of Haitians have little or no access to potable water or basic health services, and Haiti is facing an impending food crisis according to local and international organizations, and the government of Haiti. This Congress should replace the funding used by the Centers for Disease Control to address the Zika Virus threat, which depleted funds that were for Ebola response. We have not seen the full impact of Zika Virus, nor will we for several months as women give birth to children who may be impacted by the disease. I urge my colleagues to spend the last few legislative days available to us to make the American people our first priority. The material previously referred to by Ms. Slaughter is as follows: An Amendment to H. Res. 921 Offered by Ms. Slaughter At the end of the resolution, add the following new sections: Sec 5. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. 6324) to amend the Presidential Transition Act of 1963 to prohibit the use of funds provided to the President-elect and the Vice President-elect under such Act for any services or facilities provided by registered lobbyists. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. After general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill. Sec. 6. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the consideration of H.R. 6324. The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.'' The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.'' In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment [[Page H6254]] or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.'' Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [House] [Pages H6248-H6254] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5711, PROHIBITING THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY FROM AUTHORIZING CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS RELATING TO COMMERCIAL PASSENGER AIRCRAFT TO IRAN; PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5982, MIDNIGHT RULES RELIEF ACT OF 2016; AND PROVIDING FOR PROCEEDINGS DURING THE PERIOD FROM NOVEMBER 18, 2016, THROUGH NOVEMBER 28, 2016 Mr. COLLINS of Georgia.

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Rodney Davis of Illinois). The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. {time} 1230 General Leave Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous materials on House Resolution 921, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring this rule forward on behalf of the Rules Committee. The rule provides for the consideration of H.R. 5711, to prohibit the Secretary of the Treasury from authorizing certain transactions by a U.S. financial institution in connection with the export or re-export of a commercial passenger aircraft to the Islamic Republic of Iran. The rule also provides for the consideration of H.R. 5982, the Midnight Rules Relief Act. The rule provides for 1 hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by the chair and the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. It also provides a motion to recommit. Additionally, the bill provides for 1 hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Financial Services Committee, with a motion to recommit. On Monday, the Rules Committee heard testimony from the chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, Bob Goodlatte; from Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law Subcommittee Ranking Member Hank Johnson; and from the chairman of the Committee on Financial Services, Jeb Hensarling, and Congressman Denny Heck. H.R. 5982, the Midnight Rules Relief Act, was marked up and reported by the Judiciary Committee, and it enjoyed discussion at the committee level. The rule also combines H.R. 5715, the No Ex-Im Assistance for Terrorism Act, with H.R. 5711. Both of these bills were approved by the House Financial Services Committee in July. The rule makes in order five amendments to H.R. 5982 from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, and it makes in order the only amendment submitted on H.R. 5711. I am a cosponsor of the Midnight Rules Relief Act, which was authored by my friend Darrell Issa of California. This bill addresses a problem that we have seen far too often in the administrations of both parties. As the President's term draws to a close, we have come to expect a raft of new regulations to be forced upon the American people. We usually see an even greater jump in the number of regulations during the lameduck period, which is between election day and Inauguration Day. These hurried rules--midnight rules--are too often used to force the political agenda of an outgoing administration on hardworking Americans as a last-ditch attempt to implement partisan priorities. As we enter a lameduck period after last week's election, this is a particularly meaningful time to consider this legislation. I think we can agree, regardless of party, the outgoing administrations should not be rushing to impose burdensome regulations on the American people. Already, we have seen the Obama administration issue numerous midnight rules, including multiple billion-dollar rules. In fact, this administration has issued or plans to issue at least 180 such rules. Just yesterday, we were presented with a clear example of this problem when the Department of the Interior announced the finalization of a new rule on methane venting and flaring. This rule was announced by the Bureau of Land Management in an attempt to lower output despite the costs it will impose on energy production and on numerous State regulations already in place. This is just one example of an administration's rushing to finalize rules to cement a partisan policy agenda. We have seen this administration increase the regulatory burden on families and businesses by more than $100 billion. The last thing we should do is let them further that burden in the waning days of a lameduck Presidency. However, despite the clear evidence that the current administration is taking advantage of the ability to implement midnight rules, this is not a problem that is unique to only one political party. Lameduck regulations have been abused by both parties, but addressing this issue will help rein in that practice and ensure that Congress can exercise proper oversight authority. The Midnight Rules Relief Act would take steps to solve the problem by amending the Congressional Review Act to provide congressional authority to allow CRA resolutions that disapprove multiple midnight resolutions [[Page H6250]] en bloc. Currently, the CRA can only be used for individual regulations. The amended Congressional Review Act would maintain flexibility while incentivizing outgoing administrations to avoid issuing broad and controversial midnight regulations. The rule before us today also provides for the consideration of a different but equally important bill. H.R. 5711 takes critical steps to protect taxpayers and national security. Under the Iran nuclear deal, which I vocally opposed, President Obama agreed to license the exports of commercial planes. Recently, the Treasury Department authorized the sale of almost 100 planes for Iran. I can't believe this is even something we have to talk about here today, but it is a deeply serious issue. The administration has allowed the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism to receive U.S. financing and planes. H.R. 5711 takes the commonsense step of prohibiting the Secretary of the Treasury from authorizing U.S. financing in connection with the export of commercial passenger aircraft to Iran. It also makes permanent the financing prohibition for the Export-Import Bank assistance to the Government of Iran. I will say it again: this is just simply common sense. We should not and cannot be in the business of licensing the financing and sale of aircraft to a country that wishes to do us harm. The underlying bills that this rule provides consideration for are necessary to protect the American people and to restore smart policies that will protect us both here and abroad. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank my colleague from Georgia for yielding the customary time. The legislation before us today continues the majority's attempts to undermine the actions taken by President Obama. H.R. 5711 would force us to violate our international obligations under the Iran nuclear agreement, which was painstakingly negotiated by Secretary of State John Kerry, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, and Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz with the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, plus Germany. I think this is a great mistake by the United States to think that we will undermine it and that we have the ability to do that. It is very unlikely, in any event, that should this be undermined and this treaty be overturned that we could put that back together with the same group of people who negotiated it in the first place. In the process, it would put aircraft manufacturers here at home at a competitive disadvantage with their foreign competitors--something I am very much surprised that the majority would even contemplate. This legislation would also continue their attacks on the Export- Import Bank, an economic driver that has helped to create jobs and to grow our economy by expanding American businesses' access to foreign markets. These attacks stand in stark contrast to the Export-Import Bank's long history of bipartisan support, including from Presidents all the way back to John Kennedy and Bill Clinton and to Republican Presidents like Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. Mr. Speaker, instead of advancing this misguided legislation, this Chamber should be supporting our local businesses and the good-paying jobs that they create. The majority should also give the Iran nuclear agreement the time to succeed instead of rushing forward with this bill that would already put the U.S. in direct violation of it. As I said earlier, if this agreement fails, we would not likely be able to reapply the sanctions or get the support of the Security Council. If we want to achieve our goal of ensuring that Iran is unable to build a nuclear weapon, this agreement remains the best available option for peacefully and verifiably cutting off its pathways. The second bill we are considering today, H.R. 5982, is a sad continuation of the majority's attempts to delegitimize any actions taken by President Obama. This time, the majority is trying to amend the Congressional Review Act and allow Congress to invalidate regulations en bloc that are proposed in the final 60 legislative days of the President's term. That means that potentially lifesaving measures could be repealed in the blink of an eye without there being any proper evaluation or examination of their impacts. Mr. Speaker, the taxpayers expect reasonable and thoughtful governance. They also expect us to uphold the Constitution, which clearly states that Presidents have 4-year terms. That means that President Obama is President of the United States for a full 4-year term, not a 3\3/4\-year term. It is a disgrace that President Obama couldn't even get a hearing on his Supreme Court nominee, Judge Merrick Garland. This unprecedented dereliction of the majority's responsibilities is symbolic of its failure to respect this President. So many issues deserve our attention in the closing days of Congress, and it is disappointing to me and to so many others that the majority has chosen to prioritize measures--that won't even be considered in the Senate--just to take parting political shots at President Obama. We were elected to get things done, Mr. Speaker, and these bills are really just solutions in search of problems that don't exist. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I do understand that, yes, our Presidents are elected for a full 4 years. I have no problem with that. What I do have a problem with, though, is trying to push bills that cannot make it through these bodies in the proper way and with the proper oversight that Congress is supposed to have. We are set up in Article I of the Constitution as the body that makes the laws and sets the policy, along with Executive who carries out that policy. What we are simply saying is: don't go around what you can't get done in Congress and try to do it before you walk out the door. I understand that this is both sides, Mr. Speaker. This is not just this administration; it has been used by both. It just needs to stop. Congress has a role; the Executive has a role; the judiciary has a role. That is why the Founders put it together. This is simply saying: let's do it the right way. Also, just as a quick note on this issue of the planes to Iran, as a member of the military currently and also as one who served in Iraq, this is very concerning to me on many levels. Also, the problem that we see with Iran is not about not doing business--it is about the protection of American interests and American assets. In fact, this is a bipartisan issue. One of the Financial Services Committee members from across the aisle, Mr. Sherman, actually opposed this, but he actually said this--and it really makes a lot of sense. He said: Until Iran Air gets out of the business of supporting terrorism and supporting Assad's regime in Syria, the United States should not license the sale of aircraft to Iran Air. It is virtually certain that Iran Air will use these aircraft for nefarious purposes. We are just saying: put our country in a safe position. We are not talking about denying business, but we are talking about what many of us feel was a very bad decision with the Iran nuclear deal and about, simply here, just putting us back in an Article I position. I appreciate the gentlewoman from New York. I think we just need to do our business and just put our interests first, not only here, but also abroad. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer). Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentlewoman's courtesy in permitting me to speak on this, and I appreciate the statement that she just made a moment ago in opposing the rule. Mr. Speaker, I want to focus on just one area, which is H.R. 5711, designed to prohibit the transaction with Iran. I couldn't agree more with my friend on the other side of the aisle, who is managing this issue for the Republicans, in that we ought to put America's interests first. That is why the overwhelming majority of independent experts agreed with the Comprehensive Joint Plan of Action, which was designed to make it harder and less likely that Iran would develop nuclear weapons. Now, who is going to forget Benjamin Netanyahu before us and others who [[Page H6251]] were hysterical that Iran was just months away from a nuclear breakout and the threat that that posed? I, for one, agree that I don't want Iran to have nuclear weapons. I think that would be horrific. It is wrong to put nuclear weapons in their hands with the other cascading effects that could occur if they were to obtain nuclear weapons. That is why the United States--Secretary Kerry--and five other countries worked with us to use the power of our sanctions and international cooperation to make that nuclear breakout less likely. And what has happened since that agreement was signed and entered into? As a practical matter, Iran has complied with what it said it would do, and that nuclear threshold for Iran's having the potential of generating nuclear weapons has grown longer. They have reduced the number of centrifuges--less nuclear fissile material. This is what we wanted, and they have done it. {time} 1245 To this point, they have complied. We have complied, for example, by giving them back their own money that was frozen as a result of the events of the Iranian Revolution. This avenue of trying to undermine the agreement--and make no mistake, Republican leadership and a Trump administration is likely to try to overturn it altogether--will continue a pattern of mismanagement by the United States of our relationship with one of the oldest civilizations in the Middle East. This goes back over 3,000 years. Iranians are not Arabs. They are Persians. They have their own interests, their own identity. It is twice as large as Iraq and Afghanistan, more populous, more sophisticated. Pretending that we are going to attack them, as some of the people that Mr. Trump is considering for key positions have favored, would be a nightmare. Remember, the United States overthrew the popularly elected leader of Iran, working with the British in 1953, and installed the Shah on the throne. The United States sided with Saddam Hussein, who we thought was so evil that we upset the order in the Middle East and undertook that disastrous war. We sided with him as he used weapons of mass destruction against the Iranians. Now, who would blame the Iranians, given our history, for not being friendly toward the United States? The fact is--and it can be verified by friends of yours who may have visited Iran--that it is actually the country whose people have the most positive feelings toward the United States. After 9-11, there were candlelight vigils in Tehran in sympathy with Americans who were attacked. Now, many people have a cartoon image of the Iranian situation. It is complex. There are some very bad people in power in Iran, and we need to stand up to them. Many of those people want this deal to fail, just like some hardliners in the United States want it to fail. I don't think we should serve their interests. Preventing the United States to follow through on this agreement, for example, with enabling them to purchase Boeing planes, not giving us over $17 billion in business, not putting over 100,000 Americans to work and building relationships, I think, is foolish. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, in fact, if the agreement falls apart and the sanctions collapse, they will get their planes. They will just buy Airbus planes, not Boeing. Most importantly, we will be undermining an opportunity to use diplomacy to make the world safer. I have been appalled how difficult it is for us to focus on the big picture. Absolutely push back at some of the bad guys. Stand up to problems that they create. We just reinstituted the sanctions against misbehavior by Iran, and I voted for that yesterday. But don't undermine an agreement that is working--Iran has already got much of what they wanted out of this deal. If we undermine it, they can walk away. They have got some money, and they can have world opinion on their side and go ahead and develop nuclear weapons. That is crazy. We ought to abide by our agreements. We ought to stand up to them where they are wrong. We ought to promote interaction where we can. We ought to work with the very vibrant Iranian American community, which I hope Donald Trump doesn't deport. They are law-abiding, very effective citizens in the United States. We ought to be working with them to work for the cause of international peace, strengthening the American economy while we make all of us make nuclear weapons less likely and strengthen international cooperation. It was a signal achievement to have China, Russia, Germany, Great Britain, and France work with us on this agreement. We should not undercut it. We should honor it. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up a bill that would prohibit lobbyists from serving on President-elect Trump's transition team. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from New York? There was no objection. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, these bills will be going nowhere in the Senate, and we should be happy about that. We shouldn't be frittering away the closing days of this session of Congress with legislation designed to delegitimize the work of our President. There are major issues that face our country that the American people are crying out for us to address, from our crumbling infrastructure to the skyrocketing cost of education. We were elected to solve these problems, Mr. Speaker. These bills, again, utterly fail to do anything about any of that. Our constituents deserve more; the taxpayers deserve more. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I appreciate a good debate. This rule actually deals with two. One is the midnight rule, which again has been abused by both sides. Also, as it was just spoken of on the floor, there is this issue of the funds for the planes for Iran. Let me just say, I would love to go back and discuss the Iran deal that was put into place. I have been on this floor many times opposing that deal. We can talk about it. I don't think it was ever put into place to stop. Actually, there is this issue that they have complied. I just find it laughable that they have complied. They have tested rockets. They have sent people overseas. They have not complied with this. There is one thing that I agree with that the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) said just a moment ago. I agree with him when he said: Yes, Iran has got everything they want. They have got the money. They keep going. Their centrifuges are spinning. I will just say this about this issue right here: If we could actually look at this, I will support Iran when Iran is willing to be a part of the world culture and starts recognizing Israel's right to exist. I will support Iran when they are signing their agreement and not shouting ``death to America.'' Let's play on a level playing field. I have got no problem with that. We are not debating that. Unfortunately, that is the deal the next administration can deal with. At least, I will have some sympathy for them when they quit breaking the very agreement we are saying that they are honoring. I just can't see that. So these funds, I don't want them used. There are assets that we have. They are military assets. They are my brothers and sisters in arms right now who are all over the world that could be impacted by this. So as we go forward, this is a commonsense rule for two reasons. We are not going to use the bank accounts of Americans to buy planes for Iran that can be used against us in a war. We are not going to have midnight rules by both parties. It doesn't matter which party here. This is Article I, this is basic Constitution. Let the Congress do its work, not a President carrying out an agenda. [[Page H6252]] These are important bills that make smart, commonsense policy changes to protect Americans. For that reason, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation provided for by the rule and the rule itself. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on the Rule for H.R. 5711, the ``Block U.S. Financing for Iranian Aircraft Purchases,'' and H.R. 5982, the ``Midnight Rules Relief Act of 2016.'' I thank Chairman Sessions and Chairwoman Slaughter for their work in bringing this Rule before the House for consideration. I would like to thank the Rules Committee for making my amendment in order for H.R. 5982, the ``Midnight Rule Relief Act,'' which exempts any rule promulgated to prevent, respond to, or mitigate matters of critical national security. H.R. 5711, is in direct violation of a provision of the Iran Nuclear Agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA would be undermined by passage of this bill. The Administration has issued a veto threat on the bill, stating in part, ``This bill, if enacted, would contravene U.S. commitments in the JCPOA and interfere with its successful implementation. H.R. 5711 would prohibit the Secretary of the Treasury from authorizing transactions by the U.S. financial institutions in connection with the export and re-export of passenger aircraft made prior to enactment of the bill. The United States has a long tradition of remaining faithful to our commitments and our international partners, and a reversal of this principle undercuts our credibility, diminishes our ability to lead globally, and threatens the very alliances we rely upon in implementing the JCPOA. We can anticipate that should this bill become law our closest allies would view this bill as a violation of our JCPOA commitments and Iran would take the issue to the Joint Commission.'' In June, it was disclosed that Boeing had a Memorandum of Agreement with Iran Air for the sale of 80 commercial passenger planes. In September, the Treasury Department then issued a license for the sale of all 80 of these Boeing planes to Iran Air. The license also authorized U.S. financial institutions to engage in all transactions necessary to provide financing or other financial services to effectuate the sale of the Boeing planes. This bill prohibits the involvement of U.S. financial institutions in the sale of commercial passenger aircraft to Iran Air, and would put U.S. aircraft manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage with their foreign competitors, whose access to financing would not be subject to the same constraints. This will translate into jobs lost in the United States. Promises to bring jobs in October, but working to put people out of work in November is not what the public wants or expects of Congress. Complaints about Iran have access to $50 billion of unfrozen oil escrow funds as a result of the JCPOA and charging that this $50 billion could be redirected to Iran's destabilizing activities in the region is now preventing some of those funds from coming to a U.S. company that would create jobs here at home. This GOP bill would PREVENT Iran from spending well over $50 billion on commercial passenger aircraft from Boeing and other manufacturers as well as on air infrastructure improvements. This Congress has much to do with in the 13 days of official business remaining. The 114th Congress has to complete work on: 11 of the 12 House Appropriations bills; Criminal Justice Reform; Funding for the Flint Water Crisis; Restoring the Voting Rights Act; Protecting children with disabilities access to public education; Immigration Reform; Funding for the Louisiana Flooding; Funding for the damage caused by Hurricane Matthew; and Cybersecurity of the Nation's Critical Infrastructure. It is beyond shocking and unacceptable that tens of thousands of citizens living in Flint Michigan have been exposed to toxic levels of lead in their drinking water. Not only will the dangers and hazards of this disaster be felt by the residents of Flint Michigan for years to come, but the American public remains at risk to national security vulnerabilities exposed through our most basic infrastructure that supports the delivery of clean water to homes and businesses nationwide. The trust and ability to protect our citizens' basic right to clean water has been shaken, while the leadership of this Congress does nothing. We all have a duty to ensure justice and protection of our citizens. Criminal Justice Reform is a pressing issue that Congress must address. As Judge Learned Hand observed, ``If we are to keep our democracy, there must be one commandment: thou shalt not ration justice.'' Reforming the criminal justice system so that it is fairer and delivers equal justice to all persons is one of the great moral imperatives of our time. For reform to be truly meaningful, we must look at every stage at which our citizens interact with the system--from policing in our communities and the first encounter with law enforcement, to the charging and manner of attaining a conviction, from the sentence imposed to reentry and collateral consequences. House Democrats, led by House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member John Conyers of Michigan and me, as Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations, have accepted and embraced the challenge of reforming the criminal justice system and developed many innovative legislative remedies to correct many of the most glaring inequities and racial disparities in the most critical areas of the system. This is an important topic and one that Congress must turn its attention to with urgency and unity of effort to: address the harms caused; get an accounting of what happened; understand how the water was poisoned; make the lives of people damaged by this tragedy whole; find justice for those lives that may have been lost; and determine and provide for the long-term health needs of those impacted. Today, the water in Flint, Michigan is not safe to drink and we have no concrete answer on when it may be safe to drink in the future. Flint, Michigan like so many communities across the nation really felt the brunt of the financial crisis created by the abuse of new home lending practices and deceptive investment schemes that hid the weaknesses in the economy until the great recession spread across the nation beginning in late 2008. The financial damage done to communities like Flint in the form of steep declines in property values, which caused significant declines in property tax income. This was not just Flint's problem, but a national reality--for financially strapped cities, towns, school boards, and municipal governments who rely on Congress to fund all 12 Congressional appropriations bills to provide them with much needed revenue to meet the needs of their citizens. In the 51 years since its passage on August 6, 1965, the Voting Rights Act has safeguarded the right of Americans to vote and stood as an obstacle to many of the more egregious attempts by certain states and local jurisdictions to game the system by passing discriminatory changes to their election laws or administrative policies. In signing the Voting Rights Act on August 6, 1965, President Lyndon Johnson said: `The vote is the most powerful instrument ever devised by man for breaking down injustice and destroying the terrible walls which imprison men because they are different from other men.' But on June 25, 2013, the Supreme Court decided Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 193 (2013), which invalidated Section 4(b) of the VRA, and paralyzed the application of the VRA's Section 5 preclearance requirements, which protect minority voting rights where voter discrimination has historically been the worst. Since 1982, Section 5 has stopped more than 1,000 discriminatory voting changes in their tracks, including 107 discriminatory changes in Texas. Although much progress has been made with regard to Civil Rights there is still much work to be done in order to prevent systemic voter suppression and discrimination within our communities and we must remain ever vigilant and oppose schemes that will abridge or dilute the precious right to vote. H.R. 885, `Voting Rights Amendments Act of 2015,' of which I am an original co-sponsor, repairs the damage done to the Voting Rights Act by the Supreme Court decision and is capable of winning majorities in the House and Senate and the signature of the President. For millions of Americans, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is sacred treasure, earned by the sweat and toil and tears and blood of ordinary Americans who showed the world it was possible to accomplish extraordinary things. The Voting Rights Act is needed as much today to prevent another epidemic of voting disenfranchisement as Dr. Salk's vaccine is still needed to prevent another polio epidemic and I am calling again for Speaker Boehner to bring H.R. 885, `Voting Rights Amendments Act of 2015' to the floor for a vote this year. As of October 3, 2016 the Texas Education Agency has 30 days to respond to an order by the U.S. Department of Education to fix its terribly broken system that serves special needs children. Because the arbitrary cap limiting the number of special needs students enrolled in a [[Page H6253]] school district set and enforced by TEA clearly violated both the letter and spirit of the IDEA Act, on September 12, 2016, I wrote Education Secretary John King to demand that the U.S. Department of Education ``review, investigate, and take immediate and appropriate action to remedy the injury currently being suffered at least 250,000 special needs school children resulting from the systematic and intentional actions of the Texas state government to deprive these students of the rights guaranteed them by the 1990 Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA Act).'' Hubert Humphrey once said that the ``moral test of government is how it treats: those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the aged; and those in the shadows of life, the sick, the needy and the handicapped.'' By this measure, the Texas state government has been failing the moral test for more than a decade when it comes to fair treatment of special needs students. This should not have happened in Texas and we must act to be sure that it is not happening in other states. Across the nation, approximately 13% of school children receive the special education benefits guaranteed by the IDEA Act. In Texas, however, the comparable figure is 8.5%, by far the lowest of any state in the nation. If the level of service provided by the State of Texas even barely met the national average, an additional 250,000 special need students would be receiving the educational opportunity they desperately need and deserve. As I document in my letter to Education Secretary King, ``the real- world consequence of this deplorable decision is that vital supports to children with autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, dyslexia, epilepsy, mental illnesses, speech impediments, traumatic brain injuries, even blindness and deafness, are being denied to approximately 250,000 Texas children.'' When a school district, for example, ignores a mother's request for a special education evaluation, the emotional and psychological damage inflicted on her child who may be forced to repeat the second and third grade is incalculable and may be irreparable. My thoughts and prayers continue to be with the with the people of Louisiana who were adversely affected by the historic 1,000 year flooding event that has devastated the Baton Rouge area of Louisiana. This disaster is the latest reminder of the vulnerabilities posed by extreme weather events faced by people living along the Gulf Coast. The National Weather Service reported 21.86 inches of rain falling within 48 hours caused levees to overtop and rivers to breach their banks. Global climate change cares not if you believe in it; the force of nature will do its will at the expense, pain and suffering of our nation's citizens. This Congress is about to end its business without taking care of the people of Louisiana devastated by the floods earlier this year. On Oct. 7 in Florida, a peak surge of 9.88 feet above normal was measured at a tide gauge at Fernandina Beach, Florida. Storm surge flooding affected the St. Augustine area, including major flooding on Anastasia Island where water was reported to be 2.5 feet above ground level. To the south in nearby Flagler Beach, Florida, parts of A1A were washed out by the storm surge. The Northwestern-Jacksonville conducted a storm survey and found a new inlet was carved between Marineland and Matanzas Inlet, between Palm Coast and St. Augustine Beach, Florida. The St. Johns River in northeast Florida reached its highest level on record at Shands Bridge, along with 3 to 4.3 feet of storm surge inundation reported at the Racy Point, Red Bay Point and 1-295 bridge tide gauges. Early in the morning on Oct. 8, the St. Johns River was flowing backwards. Matthew's storm surge coupled with high tide lead to a record tide level at Ft. Pulaski, Georgia, early Oct. 8, and storm surge inundation roughly waist-deep was reported in parts of Charleston, South Carolina. We also should not forget Hurricane Matthew--what it did to Haiti and parts of the Southern United States requires Congressional attention to relieve people who are suffering. Even before Hurricane Matthew struck, more than a quarter of Haiti's 11 million people lived in extreme poverty, surviving on less than $1.25 a day. Haiti's people once again, in their great sorrow, need our prayers, our generosity, and our compassion. Much of what the people of Haiti have worked and fought tirelessly for over the last few years has been wiped out in this the third major natural disaster since 2010'S ruthless earthquake. Because of Hurricane Matthew hundreds of thousands of Haitians have little or no access to potable water or basic health services, and Haiti is facing an impending food crisis according to local and international organizations, and the government of Haiti. This Congress should replace the funding used by the Centers for Disease Control to address the Zika Virus threat, which depleted funds that were for Ebola response. We have not seen the full impact of Zika Virus, nor will we for several months as women give birth to children who may be impacted by the disease. I urge my colleagues to spend the last few legislative days available to us to make the American people our first priority. The material previously referred to by Ms. Slaughter is as follows: An Amendment to H. Res. 921 Offered by Ms. Slaughter At the end of the resolution, add the following new sections: Sec 5. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. 6324) to amend the Presidential Transition Act of 1963 to prohibit the use of funds provided to the President-elect and the Vice President-elect under such Act for any services or facilities provided by registered lobbyists. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. After general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill. Sec. 6. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the consideration of H.R. 6324. The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.'' The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.'' In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment [[Page H6254]] or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.'' Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [House] [Pages H6248-H6254] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5711, PROHIBITING THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY FROM AUTHORIZING CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS RELATING TO COMMERCIAL PASSENGER AIRCRAFT TO IRAN; PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5982, MIDNIGHT RULES RELIEF ACT OF 2016; AND PROVIDING FOR PROCEEDINGS DURING THE PERIOD FROM NOVEMBER 18, 2016, THROUGH NOVEMBER 28, 2016 Mr. COLLINS of Georgia.

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Rodney Davis of Illinois). The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. {time} 1230 General Leave Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous materials on House Resolution 921, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring this rule forward on behalf of the Rules Committee. The rule provides for the consideration of H.R. 5711, to prohibit the Secretary of the Treasury from authorizing certain transactions by a U.S. financial institution in connection with the export or re-export of a commercial passenger aircraft to the Islamic Republic of Iran. The rule also provides for the consideration of H.R. 5982, the Midnight Rules Relief Act. The rule provides for 1 hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by the chair and the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. It also provides a motion to recommit. Additionally, the bill provides for 1 hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Financial Services Committee, with a motion to recommit. On Monday, the Rules Committee heard testimony from the chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, Bob Goodlatte; from Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law Subcommittee Ranking Member Hank Johnson; and from the chairman of the Committee on Financial Services, Jeb Hensarling, and Congressman Denny Heck. H.R. 5982, the Midnight Rules Relief Act, was marked up and reported by the Judiciary Committee, and it enjoyed discussion at the committee level. The rule also combines H.R. 5715, the No Ex-Im Assistance for Terrorism Act, with H.R. 5711. Both of these bills were approved by the House Financial Services Committee in July. The rule makes in order five amendments to H.R. 5982 from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, and it makes in order the only amendment submitted on H.R. 5711. I am a cosponsor of the Midnight Rules Relief Act, which was authored by my friend Darrell Issa of California. This bill addresses a problem that we have seen far too often in the administrations of both parties. As the President's term draws to a close, we have come to expect a raft of new regulations to be forced upon the American people. We usually see an even greater jump in the number of regulations during the lameduck period, which is between election day and Inauguration Day. These hurried rules--midnight rules--are too often used to force the political agenda of an outgoing administration on hardworking Americans as a last-ditch attempt to implement partisan priorities. As we enter a lameduck period after last week's election, this is a particularly meaningful time to consider this legislation. I think we can agree, regardless of party, the outgoing administrations should not be rushing to impose burdensome regulations on the American people. Already, we have seen the Obama administration issue numerous midnight rules, including multiple billion-dollar rules. In fact, this administration has issued or plans to issue at least 180 such rules. Just yesterday, we were presented with a clear example of this problem when the Department of the Interior announced the finalization of a new rule on methane venting and flaring. This rule was announced by the Bureau of Land Management in an attempt to lower output despite the costs it will impose on energy production and on numerous State regulations already in place. This is just one example of an administration's rushing to finalize rules to cement a partisan policy agenda. We have seen this administration increase the regulatory burden on families and businesses by more than $100 billion. The last thing we should do is let them further that burden in the waning days of a lameduck Presidency. However, despite the clear evidence that the current administration is taking advantage of the ability to implement midnight rules, this is not a problem that is unique to only one political party. Lameduck regulations have been abused by both parties, but addressing this issue will help rein in that practice and ensure that Congress can exercise proper oversight authority. The Midnight Rules Relief Act would take steps to solve the problem by amending the Congressional Review Act to provide congressional authority to allow CRA resolutions that disapprove multiple midnight resolutions [[Page H6250]] en bloc. Currently, the CRA can only be used for individual regulations. The amended Congressional Review Act would maintain flexibility while incentivizing outgoing administrations to avoid issuing broad and controversial midnight regulations. The rule before us today also provides for the consideration of a different but equally important bill. H.R. 5711 takes critical steps to protect taxpayers and national security. Under the Iran nuclear deal, which I vocally opposed, President Obama agreed to license the exports of commercial planes. Recently, the Treasury Department authorized the sale of almost 100 planes for Iran. I can't believe this is even something we have to talk about here today, but it is a deeply serious issue. The administration has allowed the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism to receive U.S. financing and planes. H.R. 5711 takes the commonsense step of prohibiting the Secretary of the Treasury from authorizing U.S. financing in connection with the export of commercial passenger aircraft to Iran. It also makes permanent the financing prohibition for the Export-Import Bank assistance to the Government of Iran. I will say it again: this is just simply common sense. We should not and cannot be in the business of licensing the financing and sale of aircraft to a country that wishes to do us harm. The underlying bills that this rule provides consideration for are necessary to protect the American people and to restore smart policies that will protect us both here and abroad. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank my colleague from Georgia for yielding the customary time. The legislation before us today continues the majority's attempts to undermine the actions taken by President Obama. H.R. 5711 would force us to violate our international obligations under the Iran nuclear agreement, which was painstakingly negotiated by Secretary of State John Kerry, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, and Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz with the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, plus Germany. I think this is a great mistake by the United States to think that we will undermine it and that we have the ability to do that. It is very unlikely, in any event, that should this be undermined and this treaty be overturned that we could put that back together with the same group of people who negotiated it in the first place. In the process, it would put aircraft manufacturers here at home at a competitive disadvantage with their foreign competitors--something I am very much surprised that the majority would even contemplate. This legislation would also continue their attacks on the Export- Import Bank, an economic driver that has helped to create jobs and to grow our economy by expanding American businesses' access to foreign markets. These attacks stand in stark contrast to the Export-Import Bank's long history of bipartisan support, including from Presidents all the way back to John Kennedy and Bill Clinton and to Republican Presidents like Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. Mr. Speaker, instead of advancing this misguided legislation, this Chamber should be supporting our local businesses and the good-paying jobs that they create. The majority should also give the Iran nuclear agreement the time to succeed instead of rushing forward with this bill that would already put the U.S. in direct violation of it. As I said earlier, if this agreement fails, we would not likely be able to reapply the sanctions or get the support of the Security Council. If we want to achieve our goal of ensuring that Iran is unable to build a nuclear weapon, this agreement remains the best available option for peacefully and verifiably cutting off its pathways. The second bill we are considering today, H.R. 5982, is a sad continuation of the majority's attempts to delegitimize any actions taken by President Obama. This time, the majority is trying to amend the Congressional Review Act and allow Congress to invalidate regulations en bloc that are proposed in the final 60 legislative days of the President's term. That means that potentially lifesaving measures could be repealed in the blink of an eye without there being any proper evaluation or examination of their impacts. Mr. Speaker, the taxpayers expect reasonable and thoughtful governance. They also expect us to uphold the Constitution, which clearly states that Presidents have 4-year terms. That means that President Obama is President of the United States for a full 4-year term, not a 3\3/4\-year term. It is a disgrace that President Obama couldn't even get a hearing on his Supreme Court nominee, Judge Merrick Garland. This unprecedented dereliction of the majority's responsibilities is symbolic of its failure to respect this President. So many issues deserve our attention in the closing days of Congress, and it is disappointing to me and to so many others that the majority has chosen to prioritize measures--that won't even be considered in the Senate--just to take parting political shots at President Obama. We were elected to get things done, Mr. Speaker, and these bills are really just solutions in search of problems that don't exist. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I do understand that, yes, our Presidents are elected for a full 4 years. I have no problem with that. What I do have a problem with, though, is trying to push bills that cannot make it through these bodies in the proper way and with the proper oversight that Congress is supposed to have. We are set up in Article I of the Constitution as the body that makes the laws and sets the policy, along with Executive who carries out that policy. What we are simply saying is: don't go around what you can't get done in Congress and try to do it before you walk out the door. I understand that this is both sides, Mr. Speaker. This is not just this administration; it has been used by both. It just needs to stop. Congress has a role; the Executive has a role; the judiciary has a role. That is why the Founders put it together. This is simply saying: let's do it the right way. Also, just as a quick note on this issue of the planes to Iran, as a member of the military currently and also as one who served in Iraq, this is very concerning to me on many levels. Also, the problem that we see with Iran is not about not doing business--it is about the protection of American interests and American assets. In fact, this is a bipartisan issue. One of the Financial Services Committee members from across the aisle, Mr. Sherman, actually opposed this, but he actually said this--and it really makes a lot of sense. He said: Until Iran Air gets out of the business of supporting terrorism and supporting Assad's regime in Syria, the United States should not license the sale of aircraft to Iran Air. It is virtually certain that Iran Air will use these aircraft for nefarious purposes. We are just saying: put our country in a safe position. We are not talking about denying business, but we are talking about what many of us feel was a very bad decision with the Iran nuclear deal and about, simply here, just putting us back in an Article I position. I appreciate the gentlewoman from New York. I think we just need to do our business and just put our interests first, not only here, but also abroad. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer). Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentlewoman's courtesy in permitting me to speak on this, and I appreciate the statement that she just made a moment ago in opposing the rule. Mr. Speaker, I want to focus on just one area, which is H.R. 5711, designed to prohibit the transaction with Iran. I couldn't agree more with my friend on the other side of the aisle, who is managing this issue for the Republicans, in that we ought to put America's interests first. That is why the overwhelming majority of independent experts agreed with the Comprehensive Joint Plan of Action, which was designed to make it harder and less likely that Iran would develop nuclear weapons. Now, who is going to forget Benjamin Netanyahu before us and others who [[Page H6251]] were hysterical that Iran was just months away from a nuclear breakout and the threat that that posed? I, for one, agree that I don't want Iran to have nuclear weapons. I think that would be horrific. It is wrong to put nuclear weapons in their hands with the other cascading effects that could occur if they were to obtain nuclear weapons. That is why the United States--Secretary Kerry--and five other countries worked with us to use the power of our sanctions and international cooperation to make that nuclear breakout less likely. And what has happened since that agreement was signed and entered into? As a practical matter, Iran has complied with what it said it would do, and that nuclear threshold for Iran's having the potential of generating nuclear weapons has grown longer. They have reduced the number of centrifuges--less nuclear fissile material. This is what we wanted, and they have done it. {time} 1245 To this point, they have complied. We have complied, for example, by giving them back their own money that was frozen as a result of the events of the Iranian Revolution. This avenue of trying to undermine the agreement--and make no mistake, Republican leadership and a Trump administration is likely to try to overturn it altogether--will continue a pattern of mismanagement by the United States of our relationship with one of the oldest civilizations in the Middle East. This goes back over 3,000 years. Iranians are not Arabs. They are Persians. They have their own interests, their own identity. It is twice as large as Iraq and Afghanistan, more populous, more sophisticated. Pretending that we are going to attack them, as some of the people that Mr. Trump is considering for key positions have favored, would be a nightmare. Remember, the United States overthrew the popularly elected leader of Iran, working with the British in 1953, and installed the Shah on the throne. The United States sided with Saddam Hussein, who we thought was so evil that we upset the order in the Middle East and undertook that disastrous war. We sided with him as he used weapons of mass destruction against the Iranians. Now, who would blame the Iranians, given our history, for not being friendly toward the United States? The fact is--and it can be verified by friends of yours who may have visited Iran--that it is actually the country whose people have the most positive feelings toward the United States. After 9-11, there were candlelight vigils in Tehran in sympathy with Americans who were attacked. Now, many people have a cartoon image of the Iranian situation. It is complex. There are some very bad people in power in Iran, and we need to stand up to them. Many of those people want this deal to fail, just like some hardliners in the United States want it to fail. I don't think we should serve their interests. Preventing the United States to follow through on this agreement, for example, with enabling them to purchase Boeing planes, not giving us over $17 billion in business, not putting over 100,000 Americans to work and building relationships, I think, is foolish. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, in fact, if the agreement falls apart and the sanctions collapse, they will get their planes. They will just buy Airbus planes, not Boeing. Most importantly, we will be undermining an opportunity to use diplomacy to make the world safer. I have been appalled how difficult it is for us to focus on the big picture. Absolutely push back at some of the bad guys. Stand up to problems that they create. We just reinstituted the sanctions against misbehavior by Iran, and I voted for that yesterday. But don't undermine an agreement that is working--Iran has already got much of what they wanted out of this deal. If we undermine it, they can walk away. They have got some money, and they can have world opinion on their side and go ahead and develop nuclear weapons. That is crazy. We ought to abide by our agreements. We ought to stand up to them where they are wrong. We ought to promote interaction where we can. We ought to work with the very vibrant Iranian American community, which I hope Donald Trump doesn't deport. They are law-abiding, very effective citizens in the United States. We ought to be working with them to work for the cause of international peace, strengthening the American economy while we make all of us make nuclear weapons less likely and strengthen international cooperation. It was a signal achievement to have China, Russia, Germany, Great Britain, and France work with us on this agreement. We should not undercut it. We should honor it. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up a bill that would prohibit lobbyists from serving on President-elect Trump's transition team. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from New York? There was no objection. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, these bills will be going nowhere in the Senate, and we should be happy about that. We shouldn't be frittering away the closing days of this session of Congress with legislation designed to delegitimize the work of our President. There are major issues that face our country that the American people are crying out for us to address, from our crumbling infrastructure to the skyrocketing cost of education. We were elected to solve these problems, Mr. Speaker. These bills, again, utterly fail to do anything about any of that. Our constituents deserve more; the taxpayers deserve more. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I appreciate a good debate. This rule actually deals with two. One is the midnight rule, which again has been abused by both sides. Also, as it was just spoken of on the floor, there is this issue of the funds for the planes for Iran. Let me just say, I would love to go back and discuss the Iran deal that was put into place. I have been on this floor many times opposing that deal. We can talk about it. I don't think it was ever put into place to stop. Actually, there is this issue that they have complied. I just find it laughable that they have complied. They have tested rockets. They have sent people overseas. They have not complied with this. There is one thing that I agree with that the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) said just a moment ago. I agree with him when he said: Yes, Iran has got everything they want. They have got the money. They keep going. Their centrifuges are spinning. I will just say this about this issue right here: If we could actually look at this, I will support Iran when Iran is willing to be a part of the world culture and starts recognizing Israel's right to exist. I will support Iran when they are signing their agreement and not shouting ``death to America.'' Let's play on a level playing field. I have got no problem with that. We are not debating that. Unfortunately, that is the deal the next administration can deal with. At least, I will have some sympathy for them when they quit breaking the very agreement we are saying that they are honoring. I just can't see that. So these funds, I don't want them used. There are assets that we have. They are military assets. They are my brothers and sisters in arms right now who are all over the world that could be impacted by this. So as we go forward, this is a commonsense rule for two reasons. We are not going to use the bank accounts of Americans to buy planes for Iran that can be used against us in a war. We are not going to have midnight rules by both parties. It doesn't matter which party here. This is Article I, this is basic Constitution. Let the Congress do its work, not a President carrying out an agenda. [[Page H6252]] These are important bills that make smart, commonsense policy changes to protect Americans. For that reason, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation provided for by the rule and the rule itself. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on the Rule for H.R. 5711, the ``Block U.S. Financing for Iranian Aircraft Purchases,'' and H.R. 5982, the ``Midnight Rules Relief Act of 2016.'' I thank Chairman Sessions and Chairwoman Slaughter for their work in bringing this Rule before the House for consideration. I would like to thank the Rules Committee for making my amendment in order for H.R. 5982, the ``Midnight Rule Relief Act,'' which exempts any rule promulgated to prevent, respond to, or mitigate matters of critical national security. H.R. 5711, is in direct violation of a provision of the Iran Nuclear Agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA would be undermined by passage of this bill. The Administration has issued a veto threat on the bill, stating in part, ``This bill, if enacted, would contravene U.S. commitments in the JCPOA and interfere with its successful implementation. H.R. 5711 would prohibit the Secretary of the Treasury from authorizing transactions by the U.S. financial institutions in connection with the export and re-export of passenger aircraft made prior to enactment of the bill. The United States has a long tradition of remaining faithful to our commitments and our international partners, and a reversal of this principle undercuts our credibility, diminishes our ability to lead globally, and threatens the very alliances we rely upon in implementing the JCPOA. We can anticipate that should this bill become law our closest allies would view this bill as a violation of our JCPOA commitments and Iran would take the issue to the Joint Commission.'' In June, it was disclosed that Boeing had a Memorandum of Agreement with Iran Air for the sale of 80 commercial passenger planes. In September, the Treasury Department then issued a license for the sale of all 80 of these Boeing planes to Iran Air. The license also authorized U.S. financial institutions to engage in all transactions necessary to provide financing or other financial services to effectuate the sale of the Boeing planes. This bill prohibits the involvement of U.S. financial institutions in the sale of commercial passenger aircraft to Iran Air, and would put U.S. aircraft manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage with their foreign competitors, whose access to financing would not be subject to the same constraints. This will translate into jobs lost in the United States. Promises to bring jobs in October, but working to put people out of work in November is not what the public wants or expects of Congress. Complaints about Iran have access to $50 billion of unfrozen oil escrow funds as a result of the JCPOA and charging that this $50 billion could be redirected to Iran's destabilizing activities in the region is now preventing some of those funds from coming to a U.S. company that would create jobs here at home. This GOP bill would PREVENT Iran from spending well over $50 billion on commercial passenger aircraft from Boeing and other manufacturers as well as on air infrastructure improvements. This Congress has much to do with in the 13 days of official business remaining. The 114th Congress has to complete work on: 11 of the 12 House Appropriations bills; Criminal Justice Reform; Funding for the Flint Water Crisis; Restoring the Voting Rights Act; Protecting children with disabilities access to public education; Immigration Reform; Funding for the Louisiana Flooding; Funding for the damage caused by Hurricane Matthew; and Cybersecurity of the Nation's Critical Infrastructure. It is beyond shocking and unacceptable that tens of thousands of citizens living in Flint Michigan have been exposed to toxic levels of lead in their drinking water. Not only will the dangers and hazards of this disaster be felt by the residents of Flint Michigan for years to come, but the American public remains at risk to national security vulnerabilities exposed through our most basic infrastructure that supports the delivery of clean water to homes and businesses nationwide. The trust and ability to protect our citizens' basic right to clean water has been shaken, while the leadership of this Congress does nothing. We all have a duty to ensure justice and protection of our citizens. Criminal Justice Reform is a pressing issue that Congress must address. As Judge Learned Hand observed, ``If we are to keep our democracy, there must be one commandment: thou shalt not ration justice.'' Reforming the criminal justice system so that it is fairer and delivers equal justice to all persons is one of the great moral imperatives of our time. For reform to be truly meaningful, we must look at every stage at which our citizens interact with the system--from policing in our communities and the first encounter with law enforcement, to the charging and manner of attaining a conviction, from the sentence imposed to reentry and collateral consequences. House Democrats, led by House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member John Conyers of Michigan and me, as Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations, have accepted and embraced the challenge of reforming the criminal justice system and developed many innovative legislative remedies to correct many of the most glaring inequities and racial disparities in the most critical areas of the system. This is an important topic and one that Congress must turn its attention to with urgency and unity of effort to: address the harms caused; get an accounting of what happened; understand how the water was poisoned; make the lives of people damaged by this tragedy whole; find justice for those lives that may have been lost; and determine and provide for the long-term health needs of those impacted. Today, the water in Flint, Michigan is not safe to drink and we have no concrete answer on when it may be safe to drink in the future. Flint, Michigan like so many communities across the nation really felt the brunt of the financial crisis created by the abuse of new home lending practices and deceptive investment schemes that hid the weaknesses in the economy until the great recession spread across the nation beginning in late 2008. The financial damage done to communities like Flint in the form of steep declines in property values, which caused significant declines in property tax income. This was not just Flint's problem, but a national reality--for financially strapped cities, towns, school boards, and municipal governments who rely on Congress to fund all 12 Congressional appropriations bills to provide them with much needed revenue to meet the needs of their citizens. In the 51 years since its passage on August 6, 1965, the Voting Rights Act has safeguarded the right of Americans to vote and stood as an obstacle to many of the more egregious attempts by certain states and local jurisdictions to game the system by passing discriminatory changes to their election laws or administrative policies. In signing the Voting Rights Act on August 6, 1965, President Lyndon Johnson said: `The vote is the most powerful instrument ever devised by man for breaking down injustice and destroying the terrible walls which imprison men because they are different from other men.' But on June 25, 2013, the Supreme Court decided Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 193 (2013), which invalidated Section 4(b) of the VRA, and paralyzed the application of the VRA's Section 5 preclearance requirements, which protect minority voting rights where voter discrimination has historically been the worst. Since 1982, Section 5 has stopped more than 1,000 discriminatory voting changes in their tracks, including 107 discriminatory changes in Texas. Although much progress has been made with regard to Civil Rights there is still much work to be done in order to prevent systemic voter suppression and discrimination within our communities and we must remain ever vigilant and oppose schemes that will abridge or dilute the precious right to vote. H.R. 885, `Voting Rights Amendments Act of 2015,' of which I am an original co-sponsor, repairs the damage done to the Voting Rights Act by the Supreme Court decision and is capable of winning majorities in the House and Senate and the signature of the President. For millions of Americans, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is sacred treasure, earned by the sweat and toil and tears and blood of ordinary Americans who showed the world it was possible to accomplish extraordinary things. The Voting Rights Act is needed as much today to prevent another epidemic of voting disenfranchisement as Dr. Salk's vaccine is still needed to prevent another polio epidemic and I am calling again for Speaker Boehner to bring H.R. 885, `Voting Rights Amendments Act of 2015' to the floor for a vote this year. As of October 3, 2016 the Texas Education Agency has 30 days to respond to an order by the U.S. Department of Education to fix its terribly broken system that serves special needs children. Because the arbitrary cap limiting the number of special needs students enrolled in a [[Page H6253]] school district set and enforced by TEA clearly violated both the letter and spirit of the IDEA Act, on September 12, 2016, I wrote Education Secretary John King to demand that the U.S. Department of Education ``review, investigate, and take immediate and appropriate action to remedy the injury currently being suffered at least 250,000 special needs school children resulting from the systematic and intentional actions of the Texas state government to deprive these students of the rights guaranteed them by the 1990 Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA Act).'' Hubert Humphrey once said that the ``moral test of government is how it treats: those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the aged; and those in the shadows of life, the sick, the needy and the handicapped.'' By this measure, the Texas state government has been failing the moral test for more than a decade when it comes to fair treatment of special needs students. This should not have happened in Texas and we must act to be sure that it is not happening in other states. Across the nation, approximately 13% of school children receive the special education benefits guaranteed by the IDEA Act. In Texas, however, the comparable figure is 8.5%, by far the lowest of any state in the nation. If the level of service provided by the State of Texas even barely met the national average, an additional 250,000 special need students would be receiving the educational opportunity they desperately need and deserve. As I document in my letter to Education Secretary King, ``the real- world consequence of this deplorable decision is that vital supports to children with autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, dyslexia, epilepsy, mental illnesses, speech impediments, traumatic brain injuries, even blindness and deafness, are being denied to approximately 250,000 Texas children.'' When a school district, for example, ignores a mother's request for a special education evaluation, the emotional and psychological damage inflicted on her child who may be forced to repeat the second and third grade is incalculable and may be irreparable. My thoughts and prayers continue to be with the with the people of Louisiana who were adversely affected by the historic 1,000 year flooding event that has devastated the Baton Rouge area of Louisiana. This disaster is the latest reminder of the vulnerabilities posed by extreme weather events faced by people living along the Gulf Coast. The National Weather Service reported 21.86 inches of rain falling within 48 hours caused levees to overtop and rivers to breach their banks. Global climate change cares not if you believe in it; the force of nature will do its will at the expense, pain and suffering of our nation's citizens. This Congress is about to end its business without taking care of the people of Louisiana devastated by the floods earlier this year. On Oct. 7 in Florida, a peak surge of 9.88 feet above normal was measured at a tide gauge at Fernandina Beach, Florida. Storm surge flooding affected the St. Augustine area, including major flooding on Anastasia Island where water was reported to be 2.5 feet above ground level. To the south in nearby Flagler Beach, Florida, parts of A1A were washed out by the storm surge. The Northwestern-Jacksonville conducted a storm survey and found a new inlet was carved between Marineland and Matanzas Inlet, between Palm Coast and St. Augustine Beach, Florida. The St. Johns River in northeast Florida reached its highest level on record at Shands Bridge, along with 3 to 4.3 feet of storm surge inundation reported at the Racy Point, Red Bay Point and 1-295 bridge tide gauges. Early in the morning on Oct. 8, the St. Johns River was flowing backwards. Matthew's storm surge coupled with high tide lead to a record tide level at Ft. Pulaski, Georgia, early Oct. 8, and storm surge inundation roughly waist-deep was reported in parts of Charleston, South Carolina. We also should not forget Hurricane Matthew--what it did to Haiti and parts of the Southern United States requires Congressional attention to relieve people who are suffering. Even before Hurricane Matthew struck, more than a quarter of Haiti's 11 million people lived in extreme poverty, surviving on less than $1.25 a day. Haiti's people once again, in their great sorrow, need our prayers, our generosity, and our compassion. Much of what the people of Haiti have worked and fought tirelessly for over the last few years has been wiped out in this the third major natural disaster since 2010'S ruthless earthquake. Because of Hurricane Matthew hundreds of thousands of Haitians have little or no access to potable water or basic health services, and Haiti is facing an impending food crisis according to local and international organizations, and the government of Haiti. This Congress should replace the funding used by the Centers for Disease Control to address the Zika Virus threat, which depleted funds that were for Ebola response. We have not seen the full impact of Zika Virus, nor will we for several months as women give birth to children who may be impacted by the disease. I urge my colleagues to spend the last few legislative days available to us to make the American people our first priority. The material previously referred to by Ms. Slaughter is as follows: An Amendment to H. Res. 921 Offered by Ms. Slaughter At the end of the resolution, add the following new sections: Sec 5. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. 6324) to amend the Presidential Transition Act of 1963 to prohibit the use of funds provided to the President-elect and the Vice President-elect under such Act for any services or facilities provided by registered lobbyists. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. After general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill. Sec. 6. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the consideration of H.R. 6324. The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.'' The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.'' In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment [[Page H6254]] or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.'' Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. ____________________",package_114_207.csv,46711,46711,46785,"[congressional record volume 162, number 164

consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. {time} 1230 general leave mr. collins of georgia. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous materials on house resolution 921, currently under consideration. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from georgia? there was no objection. mr. collins of georgia. mr. speaker, i am pleased to bring this rule forward on behalf of the rules committee. the rule provides for the consideration of h.r. 5711, to prohibit the secretary of the treasury from authorizing certain transactions by a u.s. financial institution in connection with the export or re-export of a commercial passenger aircraft to the islamic republic of iran. the rule also provides for the consideration of h.r. 5982, the midnight rules relief act. the rule provides for 1 hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by the chair and the ranking member of the judiciary committee. it also provides a motion to recommit. additionally, the bill provides for 1 hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the financial services committee, with a motion to recommit. on monday, the rules committee heard testimony from the chairman of the committee on the judiciary, bob goodlatte; from regulatory reform, commercial and antitrust law subcommittee ranking member hank johnson; and from the chairman of the committee on financial services, jeb hensarling, and congressman denny heck. h.r. 5982, the midnight rules relief act, was marked up and reported by the judiciary committee, and it enjoyed discussion at the committee level. the rule also combines h.r. 5715, the no ex-im assistance for terrorism act, with h.r. 5711. both of these bills were approved by the house financial services committee in july. the rule makes in order five amendments to h.r. 5982 from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, and it makes in order the only amendment submitted on h.r. 5711. i am a cosponsor of the midnight rules relief act, which was authored by my friend darrell issa of california. this bill addresses a problem that we have seen far too often in the administrations of both parties. as the president's term draws to a close, we have come to expect a raft of new regulations to be forced upon the american people. we usually see an even greater jump in the number of regulations during the lameduck period, which is between election day and inauguration day. these hurried rules--midnight rules--are too often used to force the political agenda of an outgoing administration on hardworking americans as a last-ditch attempt to implement partisan priorities. as we enter a lameduck period after last week's election, this is a particularly meaningful time to consider this legislation. i think we can agree, regardless of party, the outgoing administrations should not be rushing to impose burdensome regulations on the american people. already, we have seen the obama administration issue numerous midnight rules, including multiple billion-dollar rules. in fact, this administration has issued or plans to issue at least 180 such rules. just yesterday, we were presented with a clear example of this problem when the department of the interior announced the finalization of a new rule on methane venting and flaring. this rule was announced by the bureau of land management in an attempt to lower output despite the costs it will impose on energy production and on numerous state regulations already in place. this is just one example of an administration's rushing to finalize rules to cement a partisan policy agenda. we have seen this administration increase the regulatory burden on families and businesses by more than $100 billion. the last thing we should do is let them further that burden in the waning days of a lameduck presidency. however, despite the clear evidence that the current administration is taking advantage of the ability to implement midnight rules, this is not a problem that is unique to only one political party. lameduck regulations have been abused by both parties, but addressing this issue will help rein in that practice and ensure that congress can exercise proper oversight authority. the midnight rules relief act would take steps to solve the problem by amending the congressional review act to provide congressional authority to allow cra resolutions that disapprove multiple midnight resolutions [[page h6250]] en bloc. currently, the cra can only be used for individual regulations. the amended congressional review act would maintain flexibility while incentivizing outgoing administrations to avoid issuing broad and controversial midnight regulations. the rule before us today also provides for the consideration of a different but equally important bill. h.r. 5711 takes critical steps to protect taxpayers and national security. under the iran nuclear deal, which i vocally opposed, president obama agreed to license the exports of commercial planes. recently, the treasury department authorized the sale of almost 100 planes for iran. i can't believe this is even something we have to talk about here today, but it is a deeply serious issue. the administration has allowed the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism to receive u.s. financing and planes. h.r. 5711 takes the commonsense step of prohibiting the secretary of the treasury from authorizing u.s. financing in connection with the export of commercial passenger aircraft to iran. it also makes permanent the financing prohibition for the export-import bank assistance to the government of iran. i will say it again: this is just simply common sense. we should not and cannot be in the business of licensing the financing and sale of aircraft to a country that wishes to do us harm. the underlying bills that this rule provides consideration for are necessary to protect the american people and to restore smart policies that will protect us both here and abroad. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. ms. slaughter. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i thank my colleague from georgia for yielding the customary time. the legislation before us today continues the majority's attempts to undermine the actions taken by president obama. h.r. 5711 would force us to violate our international obligations under the iran nuclear agreement, which was painstakingly negotiated by secretary of state john kerry, deputy secretary of state wendy sherman, and secretary of energy ernest moniz with the permanent members of the u.n. security council, plus germany. i think this is a great mistake by the united states to think that we will undermine it and that we have the ability to do that. it is very unlikely, in any event, that should this be undermined and this treaty be overturned that we could put that back together with the same group of people who negotiated it in the first place. in the process, it would put aircraft manufacturers here at home at a competitive disadvantage with their foreign competitors--something i am very much surprised that the majority would even contemplate. this legislation would also continue their attacks on the export- import bank, an economic driver that has helped to create jobs and to grow our economy by expanding american businesses' access to foreign markets. these attacks stand in stark contrast to the export-import bank's long history of bipartisan support, including from presidents all the way back to john kennedy and bill clinton and to republican presidents like ronald reagan and george w. bush. mr. speaker, instead of advancing this misguided legislation, this chamber should be supporting our local businesses and the good-paying jobs that they create. the majority should also give the iran nuclear agreement the time to succeed instead of rushing forward with this bill that would already put the u.s. in direct violation of it. as i said earlier, if this agreement fails, we would not likely be able to reapply the sanctions or get the support of the security council. if we want to achieve our goal of ensuring that iran is unable to build a nuclear weapon, this agreement remains the best available option for peacefully and verifiably cutting off its pathways. the second bill we are considering today, h.r. 5982, is a sad continuation of the majority's attempts to delegitimize any actions taken by president obama. this time, the majority is trying to amend the congressional review act and allow congress to invalidate regulations en bloc that are proposed in the final 60 legislative days of the president's term. that means that potentially lifesaving measures could be repealed in the blink of an eye without there being any proper evaluation or examination of their impacts. mr. speaker, the taxpayers expect reasonable and thoughtful governance. they also expect us to uphold the constitution, which clearly states that presidents have 4-year terms. that means that president obama is president of the united states for a full 4-year term, not a 3\3/4\-year term. it is a disgrace that president obama couldn't even get a hearing on his supreme court nominee, judge merrick garland. this unprecedented dereliction of the majority's responsibilities is symbolic of its failure to respect this president. so many issues deserve our attention in the closing days of congress, and it is disappointing to me and to so many others that the majority has chosen to prioritize measures--that won't even be considered in the senate--just to take parting political shots at president obama. we were elected to get things done, mr. speaker, and these bills are really just solutions in search of problems that don't exist. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. collins of georgia. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i do understand that, yes, our presidents are elected for a full 4 years. i have no problem with that. what i do have a problem with, though, is trying to push bills that cannot make it through these bodies in the proper way and with the proper oversight that congress is supposed to have. we are set up in article i of the constitution as the body that makes the laws and sets the policy, along with executive who carries out that policy. what we are simply saying is: don't go around what you can't get done in congress and try to do it before you walk out the door. i understand that this is both sides, mr. speaker. this is not just this administration; it has been used by both. it just needs to stop. congress has a role; the executive has a role; the judiciary has a role. that is why the founders put it together. this is simply saying: let's do it the right way. also, just as a quick note on this issue of the planes to iran, as a member of the military currently and also as one who served in iraq, this is very concerning to me on many levels. also, the problem that we see with iran is not about not doing business--it is about the protection of american interests and american assets. in fact, this is a bipartisan issue. one of the financial services committee members from across the aisle, mr. sherman, actually opposed this, but he actually said this--and it really makes a lot of sense. he said: until iran air gets out of the business of supporting terrorism and supporting assad's regime in syria, the united states should not license the sale of aircraft to iran air. it is virtually certain that iran air will use these aircraft for nefarious purposes. we are just saying: put our country in a safe position. we are not talking about denying business, but we are talking about what many of us feel was a very bad decision with the iran nuclear deal and about, simply here, just putting us back in an article i position. i appreciate the gentlewoman from new york. i think we just need to do our business and just put our interests first, not only here, but also abroad. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. ms. slaughter. mr. speaker, i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from oregon (mr. blumenauer). mr. blumenauer. i appreciate the gentlewoman's courtesy in permitting me to speak on this, and i appreciate the statement that she just made a moment ago in opposing the rule. mr. speaker, i want to focus on just one area, which is h.r. 5711, designed to prohibit the transaction with iran. i couldn't agree more with my friend on the other side of the aisle, who is managing this issue for the republicans, in that we ought to put america's interests first. that is why the overwhelming majority of independent experts agreed with the comprehensive joint plan of action, which was designed to make it harder and less likely that iran would develop nuclear weapons. now, who is going to forget benjamin netanyahu before us and others who [[page h6251]] were hysterical that iran was just months away from a nuclear breakout and the threat that that posed? i, for one, agree that i don't want iran to have nuclear weapons. i think that would be horrific. it is wrong to put nuclear weapons in their hands with the other cascading effects that could occur if they were to obtain nuclear weapons. that is why the united states--secretary kerry--and five other countries worked with us to use the power of our sanctions and international cooperation to make that nuclear breakout less likely. and what has happened since that agreement was signed and entered into? as a practical matter, iran has complied with what it said it would do, and that nuclear threshold for iran's having the potential of generating nuclear weapons has grown longer. they have reduced the number of centrifuges--less nuclear fissile material. this is what we wanted, and they have done it. {time} 1245 to this point, they have complied. we have complied, for example, by giving them back their own money that was frozen as a result of the events of the iranian revolution. this avenue of trying to undermine the agreement--and make no mistake, republican leadership and a trump administration is likely to try to overturn it altogether--will continue a pattern of mismanagement by the united states of our relationship with one of the oldest civilizations in the middle east. this goes back over 3,000 years. iranians are not arabs. they are persians. they have their own interests, their own identity. it is twice as large as iraq and afghanistan, more populous, more sophisticated. pretending that we are going to attack them, as some of the people that mr. trump is considering for key positions have favored, would be a nightmare. remember, the united states overthrew the popularly elected leader of iran, working with the british in 1953, and installed the shah on the throne. the united states sided with saddam hussein, who we thought was so evil that we upset the order in the middle east and undertook that disastrous war. we sided with him as he used weapons of mass destruction against the iranians. now, who would blame the iranians, given our history, for not being friendly toward the united states? the fact is--and it can be verified by friends of yours who may have visited iran--that it is actually the country whose people have the most positive feelings toward the united states. after 9-11, there were candlelight vigils in tehran in sympathy with americans who were attacked. now, many people have a cartoon image of the iranian situation. it is complex. there are some very bad people in power in iran, and we need to stand up to them. many of those people want this deal to fail, just like some hardliners in the united states want it to fail. i don't think we should serve their interests. preventing the united states to follow through on this agreement, for example, with enabling them to purchase boeing planes, not giving us over $17 billion in business, not putting over 100,000 americans to work and building relationships, i think, is foolish. the speaker pro tempore. the time of the gentleman has expired. ms. slaughter. mr. speaker, i yield an additional 2 minutes to the gentleman from oregon. mr. blumenauer. mr. speaker, in fact, if the agreement falls apart and the sanctions collapse, they will get their planes. they will just buy airbus planes, not boeing. most importantly, we will be undermining an opportunity to use diplomacy to make the world safer. i have been appalled how difficult it is for us to focus on the big picture. absolutely push back at some of the bad guys. stand up to problems that they create. we just reinstituted the sanctions against misbehavior by iran, and i voted for that yesterday. but don't undermine an agreement that is working--iran has already got much of what they wanted out of this deal. if we undermine it, they can walk away. they have got some money, and they can have world opinion on their side and go ahead and develop nuclear weapons. that is crazy. we ought to abide by our agreements. we ought to stand up to them where they are wrong. we ought to promote interaction where we can. we ought to work with the very vibrant iranian american community, which i hope donald trump doesn't deport. they are law-abiding, very effective citizens in the united states. we ought to be working with them to work for the cause of international peace, strengthening the american economy while we make all of us make nuclear weapons less likely and strengthen international cooperation. it was a signal achievement to have china, russia, germany, great britain, and france work with us on this agreement. we should not undercut it. we should honor it. mr. collins of georgia. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. ms. slaughter. mr. speaker, if we defeat the previous question, i will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up a bill that would prohibit lobbyists from serving on president-elect trump's transition team. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the record, along with extraneous material immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from new york? there was no objection. ms. slaughter. mr. speaker, these bills will be going nowhere in the senate, and we should be happy about that. we shouldn't be frittering away the closing days of this session of congress with legislation designed to delegitimize the work of our president. there are major issues that face our country that the american people are crying out for us to address, from our crumbling infrastructure to the skyrocketing cost of education. we were elected to solve these problems, mr. speaker. these bills, again, utterly fail to do anything about any of that. our constituents deserve more; the taxpayers deserve more. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. collins of georgia. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i appreciate a good debate. this rule actually deals with two. one is the midnight rule, which again has been abused by both sides. also, as it was just spoken of on the floor, there is this issue of the funds for the planes for iran. let me just say, i would love to go back and discuss the iran deal that was put into place. i have been on this floor many times opposing that deal. we can talk about it. i don't think it was ever put into place to stop. actually, there is this issue that they have complied. i just find it laughable that they have complied. they have tested rockets. they have sent people overseas. they have not complied with this. there is one thing that i agree with that the gentleman from oregon (mr. blumenauer) said just a moment ago. i agree with him when he said: yes, iran has got everything they want. they have got the money. they keep going. their centrifuges are spinning. i will just say this about this issue right here: if we could actually look at this, i will support iran when iran is willing to be a part of the world culture and starts recognizing israel's right to exist. i will support iran when they are signing their agreement and not shouting ``death to america.'' let's play on a level playing field. i have got no problem with that. we are not debating that. unfortunately, that is the deal the next administration can deal with. at least, i will have some sympathy for them when they quit breaking the very agreement we are saying that they are honoring. i just can't see that. so these funds, i don't want them used. there are assets that we have. they are military assets. they are my brothers and sisters in arms right now who are all over the world that could be impacted by this. so as we go forward, this is a commonsense rule for two reasons. we are not going to use the bank accounts of americans to buy planes for iran that can be used against us in a war. we are not going to have midnight rules by both parties. it doesn't matter which party here. this is article i, this is basic constitution. let the congress do its work, not a president carrying out an agenda. [[page h6252]] these are important bills that make smart, commonsense policy changes to protect americans. for that reason, i urge my colleagues to support the legislation provided for by the rule and the rule itself. ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, i rise to speak on the rule for h.r. 5711, the ``block u.s. financing for iranian aircraft purchases,'' and h.r. 5982, the ``midnight rules relief act of 2016.'' i thank chairman sessions and chairwoman slaughter for their work in bringing this rule before the house for consideration. i would like to thank the rules committee for making my amendment in order for h.r. 5982, the ``midnight rule relief act,'' which exempts any rule promulgated to prevent, respond to, or mitigate matters of critical national security. h.r. 5711, is in direct violation of a provision of the iran nuclear agreement known as the joint comprehensive plan of action, or jcpoa would be undermined by passage of this bill. the administration has issued a veto threat on the bill, stating in part, ``this bill, if enacted, would contravene u.s. commitments in the jcpoa and interfere with its successful implementation. h.r. 5711 would prohibit the secretary of the treasury from authorizing transactions by the u.s. financial institutions in connection with the export and re-export of passenger aircraft made prior to enactment of the bill. the united states has a long tradition of remaining faithful to our commitments and our international partners, and a reversal of this principle undercuts our credibility, diminishes our ability to lead globally, and threatens the very alliances we rely upon in implementing the jcpoa. we can anticipate that should this bill become law our closest allies would view this bill as a violation of our jcpoa commitments and iran would take the issue to the joint commission.'' in june, it was disclosed that boeing had a memorandum of agreement with iran air for the sale of 80 commercial passenger planes. in september, the treasury department then issued a license for the sale of all 80 of these boeing planes to iran air. the license also authorized u.s. financial institutions to engage in all transactions necessary to provide financing or other financial services to effectuate the sale of the boeing planes. this bill prohibits the involvement of u.s. financial institutions in the sale of commercial passenger aircraft to iran air, and would put u.s. aircraft manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage with their foreign competitors, whose access to financing would not be subject to the same constraints. this will translate into jobs lost in the united states. promises to bring jobs in october, but working to put people out of work in november is not what the public wants or expects of congress. complaints about iran have access to $50 billion of unfrozen oil escrow funds as a result of the jcpoa and charging that this $50 billion could be redirected to iran's destabilizing activities in the region is now preventing some of those funds from coming to a u.s. company that would create jobs here at home. this gop bill would prevent iran from spending well over $50 billion on commercial passenger aircraft from boeing and other manufacturers as well as on air infrastructure improvements. this congress has much to do with in the 13 days of official business remaining. the 114th congress has to complete work on: 11 of the 12 house appropriations bills; criminal justice reform; funding for the flint water crisis; restoring the voting rights act; protecting children with disabilities access to public education; immigration reform; funding for the louisiana flooding; funding for the damage caused by hurricane matthew; and cybersecurity of the nation's critical infrastructure. it is beyond shocking and unacceptable that tens of thousands of citizens living in flint michigan have been exposed to toxic levels of lead in their drinking water. not only will the dangers and hazards of this disaster be felt by the residents of flint michigan for years to come, but the american public remains at risk to national security vulnerabilities exposed through our most basic infrastructure that supports the delivery of clean water to homes and businesses nationwide. the trust and ability to protect our citizens' basic right to clean water has been shaken, while the leadership of this congress does nothing. we all have a duty to ensure justice and protection of our citizens. criminal justice reform is a pressing issue that congress must address. as judge learned hand observed, ``if we are to keep our democracy, there must be one commandment: thou shalt not ration justice.'' reforming the criminal justice system so that it is fairer and delivers equal justice to all persons is one of the great moral imperatives of our time. for reform to be truly meaningful, we must look at every stage at which our citizens interact with the system--from policing in our communities and the first encounter with law enforcement, to the charging and manner of attaining a conviction, from the sentence imposed to reentry and collateral consequences. house democrats, led by house judiciary committee ranking member john conyers of michigan and me, as ranking member of the judiciary subcommittee on crime, terrorism, homeland security, and investigations, have accepted and embraced the challenge of reforming the criminal justice system and developed many innovative legislative remedies to correct many of the most glaring inequities and racial disparities in the most critical areas of the system. this is an important topic and one that congress must turn its attention to with urgency and unity of effort to: address the harms caused; get an accounting of what happened; understand how the water was poisoned; make the lives of people damaged by this tragedy whole; find justice for those lives that may have been lost; and determine and provide for the long-term health needs of those impacted. today, the water in flint, michigan is not safe to drink and we have no concrete answer on when it may be safe to drink in the future. flint, michigan like so many communities across the nation really felt the brunt of the financial crisis created by the abuse of new home lending practices and deceptive investment schemes that hid the weaknesses in the economy until the great recession spread across the nation beginning in late 2008. the financial damage done to communities like flint in the form of steep declines in property values, which caused significant declines in property tax income. this was not just flint's problem, but a national reality--for financially strapped cities, towns, school boards, and municipal governments who rely on congress to fund all 12 congressional appropriations bills to provide them with much needed revenue to meet the needs of their citizens. in the 51 years since its passage on august 6, 1965, the voting rights act has safeguarded the right of americans to vote and stood as an obstacle to many of the more egregious attempts by certain states and local jurisdictions to game the system by passing discriminatory changes to their election laws or administrative policies. in signing the voting rights act on august 6, 1965, president lyndon johnson said: `the vote is the most powerful instrument ever devised by man for breaking down injustice and destroying the terrible walls which imprison men because they are different from other men.' but on june 25, 2013, the supreme court decided shelby county v. holder, 570 u.s. 193 (2013), which invalidated section 4(b) of the vra, and paralyzed the application of the vra's section 5 preclearance requirements, which protect minority voting rights where voter discrimination has historically been the worst. since 1982, section 5 has stopped more than 1,000 discriminatory voting changes in their tracks, including 107 discriminatory changes in texas. although much progress has been made with regard to civil rights there is still much work to be done in order to prevent systemic voter suppression and discrimination within our communities and we must remain ever vigilant and oppose schemes that will abridge or dilute the precious right to vote. h.r. 885, `voting rights amendments act of 2015,' of which i am an original co-sponsor, repairs the damage done to the voting rights act by the supreme court decision and is capable of winning majorities in the house and senate and the signature of the president. for millions of americans, the voting rights act of 1965 is sacred treasure, earned by the sweat and toil and tears and blood of ordinary americans who showed the world it was possible to accomplish extraordinary things. the voting rights act is needed as much today to prevent another epidemic of voting disenfranchisement as dr. salk's vaccine is still needed to prevent another polio epidemic and i am calling again for speaker boehner to bring h.r. 885, `voting rights amendments act of 2015' to the floor for a vote this year. as of october 3, 2016 the texas education agency has 30 days to respond to an order by the u.s. department of education to fix its terribly broken system that serves special needs children. because the arbitrary cap limiting the number of special needs students enrolled in a [[page h6253]] school district set and enforced by tea clearly violated both the letter and spirit of the idea act, on september 12, 2016, i wrote education secretary john king to demand that the u.s. department of education ``review, investigate, and take immediate and appropriate action to remedy the injury currently being suffered at least 250,000 special needs school children resulting from the systematic and intentional actions of the texas state government to deprive these students of the rights guaranteed them by the 1990 individuals with disabilities education act (idea act).'' hubert humphrey once said that the ``moral test of government is how it treats: those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the aged; and those in the shadows of life, the sick, the needy and the handicapped.'' by this measure, the texas state government has been failing the moral test for more than a decade when it comes to fair treatment of special needs students. this should not have happened in texas and we must act to be sure that it is not happening in other states. across the nation, approximately 13% of school children receive the special education benefits guaranteed by the idea act. in texas, however, the comparable figure is 8.5%, by far the lowest of any state in the nation. if the level of service provided by the state of texas even barely met the national average, an additional 250,000 special need students would be receiving the educational opportunity they desperately need and deserve. as i document in my letter to education secretary king, ``the real- world consequence of this deplorable decision is that vital supports to children with autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, dyslexia, epilepsy, mental illnesses, speech impediments, traumatic brain injuries, even blindness and deafness, are being denied to approximately 250,000 texas children.'' when a school district, for example, ignores a mother's request for a special education evaluation, the emotional and psychological damage inflicted on her child who may be forced to repeat the second and third grade is incalculable and may be irreparable. my thoughts and prayers continue to be with the with the people of louisiana who were adversely affected by the historic 1,000 year flooding event that has devastated the baton rouge area of louisiana. this disaster is the latest reminder of the vulnerabilities posed by extreme weather events faced by people living along the gulf coast. the national weather service reported 21.86 inches of rain falling within 48 hours caused levees to overtop and rivers to breach their banks. global climate change cares not if you believe in it; the force of nature will do its will at the expense, pain and suffering of our nation's citizens. this congress is about to end its business without taking care of the people of louisiana devastated by the floods earlier this year. on oct. 7 in florida, a peak surge of 9.88 feet above normal was measured at a tide gauge at fernandina beach, florida. storm surge flooding affected the st. augustine area, including major flooding on anastasia island where water was reported to be 2.5 feet above ground level. to the south in nearby flagler beach, florida, parts of a1a were washed out by the storm surge. the northwestern-jacksonville conducted a storm survey and found a new inlet was carved between marineland and matanzas inlet, between palm coast and st. augustine beach, florida. the st. johns river in northeast florida reached its highest level on record at shands bridge, along with 3 to 4.3 feet of storm surge inundation reported at the racy point, red bay point and 1-295 bridge tide gauges. early in the morning on oct. 8, the st. johns river was flowing backwards. matthew's storm surge coupled with high tide lead to a record tide level at ft. pulaski, georgia, early oct. 8, and storm surge inundation roughly waist-deep was reported in parts of charleston, south carolina. we also should not forget hurricane matthew--what it did to haiti and parts of the southern united states requires congressional attention to relieve people who are suffering. even before hurricane matthew struck, more than a quarter of haiti's 11 million people lived in extreme poverty, surviving on less than $1.25 a day. haiti's people once again, in their great sorrow, need our prayers, our generosity, and our compassion. much of what the people of haiti have worked and fought tirelessly for over the last few years has been wiped out in this the third major natural disaster since 2010's ruthless earthquake. because of hurricane matthew hundreds of thousands of haitians have little or no access to potable water or basic health services, and haiti is facing an impending food crisis according to local and international organizations, and the government of haiti. this congress should replace the funding used by the centers for disease control to address the zika virus threat, which depleted funds that were for ebola response. we have not seen the full impact of zika virus, nor will we for several months as women give birth to children who may be impacted by the disease. i urge my colleagues to spend the last few legislative days available to us to make the american people our first priority. the material previously referred to by ms. slaughter is as follows: an amendment to h. res. 921 offered by ms. slaughter at the end of the resolution, add the following new sections: sec 5. immediately upon adoption of this resolution the speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule xviii, declare the house resolved into the committee of the whole house on the state of the union for consideration of the bill (h.r. 6324) to amend the presidential transition act of 1963 to prohibit the use of funds provided to the president-elect and the vice president-elect under such act for any services or facilities provided by registered lobbyists. the first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. all points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. general debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the committee on oversight and government reform. after general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. all points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. at the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the committee shall rise and report the bill to the house with such amendments as may have been adopted. the previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions. if the committee of the whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day the house shall, immediately after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule xiv, resolve into the committee of the whole for further consideration of the bill. sec. 6. clause 1(c) of rule xix shall not apply to the consideration of h.r. 6324. the vote on the previous question: what it really means this vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. a vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. it is a vote about what the house should be debating. mr. clarence cannon's precedents of the house of representatives (vi, 308-311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the house being made by the member in charge.'' to defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the house. cannon cites the speaker's ruling of january 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the house to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to offer an amendment. on march 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. the house defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. speaker joseph g. cannon (r-illinois) said: ``the previous question having been refused, the gentleman from new york, mr. fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.'' the republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' but that is not what they have always said. listen to the republican leadership manual on the legislative process in the united states house of representatives, (6th edition, page 135). here's how the republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ``although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule . . . when the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. that member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.'' in deschler's procedure in the u.s. house of representatives, the subchapter titled ``amending special rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the committee on rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.'' (chapter 21, section 21.2) section 21.3 continues: ``upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the committee on rules, control shifts to the member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment [[page h6254]] or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.'' clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. it is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the republican majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. mr. collins of georgia. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time, and i move the previous question on the resolution. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on ordering the previous question. the question was taken; and the speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. ms. slaughter. mr. speaker, on that i demand the yeas and nays. the yeas and nays were ordered. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to clause 8 of rule xx, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. ____________________",46711

SEC. 102. REVOCATION OF PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS. If the Secretary of the Treasury authorized any transaction described under section 101 before the date of the enactment of this title, such authorization is hereby revoked. TITLE II--NO EX-IM ASSISTANCE FOR TERRORISM SEC. 201. SHORT TITLE. This title may be cited as the ``No Ex-Im Assistance for Terrorism Act''. [[Page H6256]] SEC. 202. PROHIBITION ON EXPORT-IMPORT BANK FINANCING THAT WOULD BENEFIT IRAN. Section 2(b) of the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 (12 U.S.C. 635(b)) is amended by adding at the end the following: ``(14) Prohibition on Financing That Would Benefit Iran.-- ``(A) Direct financing.--The Bank shall not guarantee, insure, or extend (or participate in an extension of) credit in connection with any transaction with respect to which credit assistance from the Bank is first sought after the effective date of this paragraph by-- ``(i) the Government of Iran or an entity owned or controlled by the Government of Iran; or ``(ii) an entity created under Iranian law, or a foreign subsidiary of such an entity. ``(B) Indirect financing.--The Bank shall not guarantee, insure, or extend (or participate in an extension of) credit in connection with any transaction with respect to which credit assistance from the Bank is first sought after the effective date of this paragraph involving-- ``(i) an entity for the purpose of a transaction involving the Government of Iran or an entity referred to in subparagraph (A); or ``(ii) a non-United States entity that, in the 5-year period ending with the date of the enactment of this paragraph, has leased or sold aircraft to the Government of Iran or an entity referred to in subparagraph (A) in contravention of United States law, or a subsidiary or controlling parent of such a non-United States entity. ``(C) Cancellation of approved financing.--The Bank shall cease the provision of financial assistance approved by the Bank in connection with a transaction with respect to which credit assistance from the Bank is approved after the effective date of this paragraph, on finding that the assistance has facilitated the export, sale, or lease of an aircraft to an entity referred to in subparagraph (A), and shall seek immediate recovery of any amount provided by the Bank in connection with the transaction.''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill shall be debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and the ranking minority member of the Committee on Financial Services. After 1 hour of debate, it shall be in order to consider the further amendment printed in part A of House Report 114-818, if offered by the Member designated in the report, which shall be considered read and shall be separately debatable for the time specified in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent. The gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine Waters) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. General Leave Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to submit extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. When our fellow Americans deposit their earnings in a U.S. bank or entrust the government with their tax dollars, they do so assuming that their money will not be used in ways which undermine the security of our very Nation and, frankly, of the world. The legislation we are debating tonight is a package of bills that is designed to prevent the Obama administration from further undermining the trust of the American people and the security of our Nation, as well as the security of our allies. Under President Obama's nuclear deal with Iran, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or the JCPOA, the administration agreed to authorize the export of civilian aircraft to Iran. What the JCPOA did not include was authorization for the U.S. financing of those sales. As Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said in April in a Council on Foreign Relations speech: ``Iran, complied with the nuclear agreement. Therefore, the nuclear sanctions are lifted. I think that that is a process that is becoming more and more clear. And we'll keep our part of the bargain there. But the U.S. financial system is not open to Iran and that is not something that is going to change.'' Again, that was Secretary Jack Lew in April of this past year. Mr. Speaker, something changed. In September, the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control issued licenses to Airbus and to Boeing that permitted the sale of up to 97 airplanes to Iran Air, the country's flagship, state-owned carrier. These licenses didn't stop there, however. By going beyond the scope of the JCPOA, they also authorized U.S. financial institutions to ``engage in all transactions necessary to provide financing or other financial services'' related to the Iran Air orders. My bill, H.R. 5711, would prohibit the Secretary of the Treasury from authorizing U.S. financing through American banks in connection with the export of commercial aircraft to Iran just as the administration claimed was U.S. policy to begin with. This bill would keep Americans' deposits away from a country that the President's own State Department calls ``the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism'' and which the Treasury has designated as ``a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern.'' Let me repeat that. The State Department, itself, says this is the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism, and the Treasury Department has designated a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern. How many more red flags need to go up? Under this bill, Americans would not have to fear that their savings are being channeled to Iran Air, which was sanctioned by the Treasury in 2011 for ferrying soldiers and weapons of war to Syria--the site of a 5-year conflict that has claimed a half a million lives and has displaced millions more. This is the same Iran Air that a U.N. report concluded had shared ballistic military technology with North Korea and is the same Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps whose deputy commander called for an end to Israel, making note of more than 100,000 missiles that were ready ``for the annihilation--the wiping out--and the collapse of the Zionist regime.'' Additionally, research by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies shows that Iran Air's support of the Assad regime continues to this very day. Why should U.S. banks and their customers be implicated in Iranian atrocities? I would submit that there is no reasonable answer to this, which is why this commonsense prohibition, when offered as an amendment to this year's Financial Services appropriations bill, was passed by this very body--the House of Representatives--by a voice vote. However, this bill goes even further, Mr. Speaker. Not only will H.R. 5711 protect Americans' bank accounts, it will prevent their tax dollars from being used through the Export-Import Bank to subsidize aircraft sales to Iran. It would be through direct transactions or third-party leasing, which is becoming more and more common. This codifies and strengthens an existing Ex-Im prohibition that is renewed in annual appropriations bills. For that reason, this measure enjoyed the support of Ex-Im supporters and critics alike when it came before the Financial Services Committee. H.R. 5711 combines the text of two bills that were reported by the Committee on Financial Services; one of them sponsored by me and the other by Congressman Roskam of Illinois. Both pieces of legislation were cosponsored by our Democrat colleague, Congressman Sherman of California, who has devoted years to Iran policy, both as a member of the Financial Services Committee and of the Foreign Affairs Committee. I thank Representative Sherman and Representative Roskam for working with me on this very important legislation package; and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this important bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am disappointed that we are here, yet again, debating another Republican bill to undermine the Iran nuclear deal--a deal that, so far, has delivered on its principal goal of blocking Iran's path to nuclear weapons for the foreseeable future. This is a dangerous move that, if enacted, would put U.S. and global security at risk. Specifically, H.R. 5711 would prohibit the Treasury Secretary from authorizing any transaction by a U.S. financial institution to support the export of commercial planes to Iran. Doing so would violate a key component of the agreement in which the U.S. has committed to allowing the sales of these planes and the associated financial [[Page H6257]] services that are necessary to support the sales. Earlier this year, the Treasury Department issued a license to Boeing for the sale of 80 passenger planes to Iran--valued at $17.6 billion-- and authorized U.S. financial institutions to engage in all transactions necessary to allow Boeing to receive payment for the sale. This legislation not only puts the Boeing deal in the crosshairs by prohibiting it from conducting a lawful sale under the agreement, but it also places the viability of the nuclear deal itself in question. Moreover, this legislation would breach the good faith provision in the agreement by which all parties agreed not to undermine its successful implementation. H.R. 5711 also includes language that prevents the Export-Import Bank from financing exports to Iran, which is a red herring because the Ex- Im Bank has not supported exports to Iran since the 1970s, and it is legally prohibited from doing so as long as Iran is a state sponsor of terror. Notably, the bill removes the President's national security waiver with regard to these restrictions--a move that denies the President the flexibility that is necessary to work with our allies to find the most effective ways of changing Iran's behavior. The fact is that all previous Iran sanctions bills that have passed the House and that have become law have included a Presidential waiver that gives the President the flexibility to act quickly and maneuver when doing so serves the U.S. national security interest. Mr. Speaker, I am particularly concerned that this bill comes at a time of deep global uncertainty about U.S. foreign policy. We have a President-elect whose talk on foreign policy has ranged from vague and contradictory in some areas to utterly incoherent elsewhere. He has inserted unpredictability into the international arena, has questioned the value of U.S. alliances, and has threatened the cornerstones of decades of American foreign policy leadership. Yet, instead of reassuring the world that the United States is committed to working with our global allies to promote our collective security, House Republicans have decided to push yet another piece of legislation through the House to destabilize the agreement that is central to preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. {time} 1800 I do wonder why their leadership decided to bring this bill to the floor now in the lameduck session when they know the President will veto it. Perhaps my colleagues on the other side of the aisle know that in two short months, they will no longer have the luxury of legislating without consequences. Come January, we will have a President who has called the Iran nuclear agreement the worst deal ever negotiated. Like most of his other nonsense policies, Mr. Trump has claimed he will either more strictly enforce the agreement or negotiate ``a much better deal'' or dismantle it altogether. We don't know, and he doesn't know. So I am going to bet that, under the Trump administration, Republicans will not be so eager to move legislation to unravel this agreement because, like the rest of us, they do not know how Mr. Trump will govern and because they know there is no other reasonable approach to curbing Iran's nuclear ambition, short of military intervention. I, therefore, urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this bill and sending a strong message to the President-elect and our allies around the world that Democrats remain committed to a strong U.S. engagement in the world and will not tolerate any attempt to undermine the Iran nuclear deal or any other international arrangements that keep us safe. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Roskam), a leader on this issue who is the author of H.R. 5715. Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga) and also Chairman Hensarling for their consistent and persistent work on this issue. My friend from California mentioned a minute ago her disappointment. Well, if you want to talk about disappointment and destabilizing of the deal, just look at what the Iranians have done since the JCPOA passed. By the way, a majority of the House of Representatives and a majority of the United States Senate, not on a partisan basis either, Mr. Speaker, voted against the JCPOA. So let's put that in context. But the President insisted, he moved along, and here we are. So let's see what we can do about it. Before we fix it, let's look at what the Iranians have done. They are the destabilizers. There have been Iranian-supplied rockets launched at a U.S. Naval ship. Iran has fired rockets within 1,500 feet in December of last year on U.S. ships numerous times. The IRGC patrol boats have aggressively harassed U.S. ships in the Strait of Hormuz. Iran has launched numerous ballistic missile tests in violation of the U.N. Security Council resolutions. They violated the JCPOA by producing excess heavy water. They continue to kidnap Americans and hold them for ransom. So let's put it where it lies. The destabilizing impact doesn't belong with the United States. It doesn't belong with any statement by an American policyholder. The destabilizing nature belongs, Mr. Speaker, to the Iranian regime, the mullahs themselves. So the gentlewoman from California said she is disappointed. Well, look, I mean, disappointment, get used to it. It is the nature of things. The nature of the disappointment is that we now have American companies that are saying: You know what? Let's go in and let's do business with a terrorist regime. How is that? Let's just go make a buck. That is the scandal of this. The scandal is that there are American companies, there are international companies--Boeing, Airbus--that are now making their own names inextricably linked with terror forever more. That is the scandal. So what are we trying to do? The gentlewoman said that the Ex-Im elements of this--I think she said--was a red herring. If not, it was words to that effect. No, it is not so. Because if you look carefully at what the Ex-Im prohibition actually prohibits, Mr. Speaker, it prohibits the direct financing to the Iranian regime. Fine, if that is all this did, well and good. There is no reason to oppose it, then. Of course, that is not where the Ex-Im is actually limited. Because here is what can happen: under current law, the Ex-Im Bank can do a deal with the Europeans, for example. What can happen, then? That can be leased under current law to the Iranians. This amendment, Mr. Huizenga's language, would prohibit that. That is what we are trying to do. Look, think about the irony of this. You have got an administration that currently is telling Americans it is a dangerous thing to go to Iran; that you are at risk of being kidnapped if you go to Iran. At the same time--picture this, Mr. Speaker--that that is being articulated, they are also saying: We are going to help you do some business over there. That is ridiculous. It is absurd, it is contradictory, and it is indefensible. So here is the good news: The good news is we can do something about it. The other good news is this Iran deal has a very short shelf life because the President-elect has said he doesn't like it. President Obama didn't do the hard work of developing a national consensus on it. If he had, it would have been a treaty and a treaty that would have bound the United States in permanency; but he didn't do that. Why? Because it was a bad idea and he couldn't sell it to Congress. So he went the easy way, did it basically by executive order. And what goes around comes around. So we can do some good work here today. We can move this out. Is President Obama going to sign it? Obviously not, but that is not to say that it is not what we should do. We know what we need to do. We need to make sure that the American financial system is not complicit in this deal. We need to make sure that American taxpayers are not subsidizing this deal. I urge the bill's passage. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Himes), a member of the Financial Services Committee and the House [[Page H6258]] Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, with all due respect to the gentleman from Michigan, once again, we find ourselves in this dreary and dangerous ritual of considering a bill which, without question, would cause us to violate our agreement under the JCPOA. We get the same arguments about how bad the Iranian regime is, and we get the same misstatements like: This is President Obama's deal. It is not President Obama's deal. It is a deal of the United Nations Security Council, of China, of Russia, of Great Britain, of France, of Germany, the U.K., and the rest of the world who combined working for a period of almost 15 years hammered out a deal--and I say this as a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence--which today has removed Iran as a nuclear threat. Yet, here again, we are offered a bill that would compromise our obligations and almost certainly result in centrifuges spinning once again in Tehran and then leading on to the very likely prospect of yet another Middle Eastern war. Yes, Iran is a sponsor of terrorism. Yes, it is a bad place. You will get no argument from this side of the aisle that this is a bad regime. Once again, I remind my Republican friends that their patron saint, Ronald Reagan, made a nuclear deal with the Soviet Union, also a sponsor of terrorism, an appalling regime; but Ronald Reagan was smart enough to know that you can make a deal that makes everybody safer even with some very bad people. Ronald Reagan. One thing I know as a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence is that what used to be a mortal national security threat to the United States--2 to 3 months from breakout time, 2 to 3 months over which would almost certainly be involved in yet another war in the Middle East--has been taken off the table. Now, the Republicans not only seek to scuttle that deal with all of the implications, but they do it by stopping an American company from selling a flagship American product around the world. If you use the Department of Commerce's multiplier, the bill they are pushing today would result in 100,000 American jobs not created so that they can continue with this fetish of eliminating a deal, which has made us safer. If there is any question about whether this has made us safer, let me again quote General Gadi Eizenkot, who is the chief of staff of the Israeli Defense Forces. He said the deal has actually removed the most serious danger to Israel's existence for the foreseeable future and greatly reduced the threat over the longer term. That is the chief of staff of the Israeli Defense Forces, but my friends in the Republican Party know better about what is good for Israel. These sad charades end pretty soon because the bluff has been called. President Trump has said he will tear up the Iran deal. When he does that--because this, of course, is not becoming law--the centrifuges will spin again. To my friends on the other side of the aisle, when the centrifuges are spinning, we and I will stand here and we will tell the American people why centrifuges are spinning again. And where we were 2 years ago when we thought we were going to war with Iran, if we go to Iran, when Israeli planes are bombing Iran, we will stand here and explain why we are now in another Middle Eastern war. We can avoid that by ending these charades and finally accepting this deal. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot), who is the chairman of the Small Business Committee, but also a previous chair of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5711. I want to the commend my colleagues, Congressmen Huizenga and Sherman, for authoring this bipartisan piece of legislation. It was once said that the West would sell its enemies the rope that would be used to hang itself with. Well, because of the disastrously flawed Iran deal, that is exactly what we are currently doing. That is why this legislation is so important. H.R. 5711 essentially prevents the export or reexport of commercial passenger aircraft to the Islamic Republic of Iran. This bill would cut off Iran's means of delivering weapons to terrorist organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah, and to Syrian dictator Bashir al-Assad, a war criminal who is responsible for the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War. The truth is we wouldn't even need to be here today if the Obama administration had just paid attention to the facts on the ground in the Middle East. When negotiating the disastrous Iran nuclear deal, despite knowing Iran was the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, President Obama and Secretary Kerry permitted the sale of commercial aircraft to Iran anyway. Incredibly, under current U.S. law, if we issued a license for Iran Air to purchase aircraft from an American manufacturer and then Iran walked away from its commitment, U.S. taxpayers would have to foot the bill for Iran. In this case, that could be up to $70 billion on the U.S. taxpayer. Given Iran Air's multiple unpaid commitments over the years, that outrageous outcome is entirely possible. So for all of the reasons that I have mentioned and for reasons that have been stated already by my colleagues, I would urge clear-minded people on both sides of the aisle to support this legislation. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Price), a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee. Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 5711. This legislation is only the latest misguided and politicized effort by the majority to undermine the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, a historic agreement negotiated by the world's major powers in order to keep Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. Simply put, enactment of H.R. 5711 would violate the United States Government's obligations under the JCPOA, opening the door for Iran to walk away from this agreement. It also threatens to undermine our credibility with our allies and negotiating partners. Now, we must be vigilant. No one disagrees that we must be vigilant in ensuring Iranian compliance with the terms of the JCPOA. We also should continue to hold Iran to account for its violations of human rights, for its sponsorship of terrorism, and for its nonnuclear weapons development. Last night, I supported, as did almost every Member of this body, a clean reauthorization of the Iran Sanctions Extension Act, which guarantees Congress' ability to snap back sanctions should Iran violate the JCPOA. The reauthorization also allows Congress to take positive action on transition day should it be verified that Iran has used its nuclear capacity only for peaceful purposes. So the continued authorization of sanctions will allow the United States to continue to exert pressure on the Iranian regime. The dangerous bill before us today will do just exactly the opposite. By directly blocking a specific provision of the JCPOA--namely, the permissible sale of commercial passenger aircraft--this legislation would send a clear message to the Iranian people that the United States does not negotiate in good faith; that we expect to have it both ways, with Iran dismantling its nuclear facilities and getting nothing in return. {time} 1815 We must also remember, my colleagues, that the Iran nuclear agreement is not just a bilateral agreement between Iran and the United States. It is the product of years and years of negotiations between Iran and the P5+1, which is the United Kingdom, China, France, Russia, Germany, and the United States. The bill before us today would break faith with those negotiating partners in a reckless and dangerous way. Because of this agreement, the breakout time for Iran to develop enough weapons-grade material for a nuclear weapon went from 2 to 3 months to a year or more. Because of this agreement, the international community has 24/7 access to Iran's nuclear sites. Because of this agreement, we possess the enforcement mechanisms necessary to verify Iran's compliance. [[Page H6259]] By all objective accounts, Iran has upheld its end of the bargain. Why would we give up these capabilities by failing to uphold ours? In light of the political transitions taking place in our country, now is especially the time when the United States must keep its word, its word to our allies and to the international community. Now, regardless of all this, it appears that our Republican colleagues are willing to jeopardize a major international agreement for political advantage. They are willing to undermine the credibility of the United States and our allies on the international stage. My colleagues, instead of scoring political points or seeking to undo the foreign policy legacy of the outgoing President, we should be working together in a bipartisan manner to ensure this agreement's success. For that reason, I urge colleagues to vote against this bill. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), a member of the House Committee on Financial Services. Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5711. Despite the President's assurances, Iran remains a menace to the stability of the Middle East and a threat to America and its allies. All of us, both Republicans and Democrats, need to take action to reduce the harm that this rogue state and its accomplices can do. H.R. 5711 takes some very important steps in that effort. By prohibiting the Secretary of the Treasury from green-lighting U.S. financing for the export of commercial aircraft to Iran, we are making it more difficult for Iranian airlines to acquire planes that we know are used to ferry soldiers and weapons. I need to ask my colleagues across the aisle: Is that such a bad idea? By blocking Ex-Im assistance to the Government of Iran, we are preventing the U.S. taxpayer from subsidizing efforts by the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism to acquire aircraft to support its deadly activities around the world. We can all agree that Ex-Im should never be used for this purpose. The Government of Iran continues to fund terrorist activities, and it is intimately involved in Syria's violent civil war. Let us not forget the recent hostile actions taken by Houthi rebels in Yemen. These rebels receive funds from Iran, and they fired missiles at U.S. Navy warships on patrol in the Red Sea. The American people cannot be complicit in these hostilities. We owe it to our constituents and our allies around the world to pass this commonsense legislation. I thank my colleagues from Michigan, Illinois, and California for introducing this bill. I urge its support. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett), a member of the Committee on Ways and Means. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, will this Congress ground Boeing or support this key manufacturer and the jobs that it creates, that have already helped make America great? Will we march to the tune of the pied pipers against peace who see war with Iran as the only way to restrain it from developing nuclear weapons? Part of what makes trade so important to us is that countries that trade together are less likely to go to war with one another. The House today is being asked to vote to block the sale of about 80 Boeing aircraft to update an aging and unsafe commercial airline in Iran. If this bill passes, that is bad news for a major American business, and it is also bad news to thousands of skilled workers across this country who won't see any part of what could be a $25 billion deal. It is great news for Boeing's major European competitor to get the work that these supporters would deny to Boeing. This is, of course, just the latest of one effort after another to undermine the only way forward, short of war, to limit Iran's ability to develop nuclear weapons. This realization is why this very week so many national security experts have urged Mr. Trump to reconsider, to reverse his threat to break the promises that our country made in an international agreement. This week also, the European Union affirmed its support for that international agreement. The six other countries that joined us in that international agreement are honoring their promises, and we should do the same thing. What will keep Boeing from flying high? It is the war hawks that fly high, so insistent on undermining this important pact that has made our family safer. If the hawks win, it is about more than losing a multibillion-dollar deal to one American manufacturer. It really means that nothing--nothing--but the threat of another American war, an American attack, will hold Iran back from developing nuclear weapons. This is about more than destabilizing the American workforce. Undermining this agreement will destabilize the Middle East. It will jeopardize our families and the families of our allies. Once again, this measure should be rejected. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Pittenger), a member of the Committee on Financial Services. Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to voice my support for H.R. 5711 and to thank Congressman Huizenga for his leadership on this very important issue. This bill prohibits the Secretary of the Treasury from authorizing certain transactions by U.S. financial institutions in connection with the export or reexport of a commercial passenger aircraft to the Islamic Republic of Iran. As the primary sponsor of terrorism throughout the world, it is imperative that we hold Iran accountable and do all we can to limit their abilities to promote this type of action and behavior. This bill confronts the same airline that has been sanctioned by the Treasury Department for transporting fighters and weapons on behalf of Iran's Revolutionary Guard. It is beyond me how the administration can be okay with allowing Iran access to airplanes which would only further their support of terrorism. I supported this commonsense legislation when it was marked up in the Committee on Financial Services, and I am proud to support it today. Thank you to my good friend, Congressman Huizenga, for sponsoring this legislation. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations on the Committee on the Judiciary. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California, Ranking Member Waters, for the leadership that she gave this issue in the Committee on Financial Services, and I rise today to offer my opposition to this bill for a number of reasons. I will say that it is interesting--I heard my colleague from North Carolina mention the Soviet Union and the interests and the efforts that President Reagan made to, in fact, make America safer in his time and in his context. Interestingly, in the backdrop of today, one could now argue that Russia has, in its portfolio, advocacy for terrorists as well as a large profile of cyberterrorism and hacking into the United States as well as a blatant interference in the most recent Presidential election. As I look to my colleagues speaking about what the President-elect will do, I would hope that he would not undermine the national security of this Nation. First of all, we know that this bill will be vetoed if it gets to the desk of President Obama. This bill would damage a hard-fought diplomatic solution that makes the world safer from nuclear war. The sanctions are working, including extensive monitoring of the nuclear capability of Iran. We also, in a bipartisan manner, supported the potential extinction of Iran sanctions yesterday, and that was the right thing to do, the opportunity or the possibility of doing that. But this bill, in particular, flies in the face of a realistic approach to how we do international engagement. The JCPOA has significantly constrained Iran's nuclear program. Key aspects of the program are dismantled under the JCPOA, and it subjects Iran's nuclear program to unprecedented verification and monitoring requirements. It is working. It is profoundly in the national security interests of the United States to continue to meet our commitments [[Page H6260]] under the JCPOA as long as Iran continues to meet its commitments. Our allies are depending on us. The word of the United States should mean something. We even know that Israel has seen a positive impact, some of its military persons have indicated, by way of the JCPOA. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman. Ms. JACKSON LEE. This bill prohibits the involvement of U.S. financial institutions in the sale of commercial passenger aircraft to Iran Air, civil end use that would put U.S. aircraft manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage with their foreign competitors whose access to financing would not be subject to the same constraints. This is not putting commercialism or jobs above national security. It is, in fact, allowing civil end use to continue as we are standing for our national security. The sweeping and vague nature of this provision would have a chilling effect on U.S. and non-U.S. entities seeking to engage in permissible business with Iran. The United States has a long tradition of remaining faithful to our commitments with our international partners, and a reversal of this principle undercuts our credibility, diminishes our ability to lead globally, and threatens the very alliances we rely upon in implementing the JCPOA. We can anticipate that should this bill become law, our closest allies would view this bill as a violation of the JCPOA commitments, and Iran would take the issue to the Joint Commission. The main thing of this bill is that it will douse the friendship and alliance that we are making with allies who want a peaceful nonproliferation of nuclear activity. This is a ``no'' vote in order to provide for the national security of this Nation. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Schweikert), a member of the House Committee on Financial Services. Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Huizenga for the couple minutes. This is one of those moments, has anyone actually read the four pages on the bill? Great. In that case, we should all know this isn't about selling jets. It is about using the American financial system to finance them. That is what the language of the bill is. Think about this. We have now spent the last 6 years around this body talking over and over and over how we are going to keep the American financial system safe, how we are going to not do things that concentrate debt within our capital markets. If Iran wants to buy jets, let them go find bilateral agreements in other countries. Let them show up with the cash. Let them go find someone else to put up the surety bonds. Let someone else go put up the coverage on the lost pieces on the ladder of the financing. This piece of legislation coming through the Committee on Financial Services is about protecting our financial system, first, from what many of us on the committee believe is going to turn into bad debt and functionally become toxic within our financial markets; but then, secondly, do you really want the United States financial system providing liquidity and financing for the leading state sponsor of terrorism in the world? That is a pretty powerful ethical question when you consider what we have been through in cleaning up our own financial system over the last few years. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am sorry that Mr. Pittenger left because I really did want to share this point with him. It is important to note that nothing in this legislation will keep new passenger aircraft out of the hands of Iran. The bill only prevents Boeing from selling civilian passenger aircraft to Iran, while foreign aircraft manufacturers, such as Airbus, will still be able to sell their passenger planes to Iran since they won't need U.S. financial institutions to help finance their deals. {time} 1830 What is this? Is this some kind of payback to Boeing? Is this some kind of---- Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Will the gentlewoman yield? Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I yield to the gentleman from Michigan. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. That is actually not true. Airbus is subject to this as well because of the significant number of parts and material in the jets that they produce. So they would be subject to this as well as Boeing. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Reclaiming my time, there is nothing in this legislation that will keep new passenger aircraft out of the hands of Iran. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Williams), who is also a member of the House Financial Services Committee. Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Huizenga for his leadership. Mr. Speaker, the Obama administration's State Department recognizes the Islamic Republic of Iran as one of three state sponsors of terrorism. But, ironically, the President calls his deal with Iran a foreign policy achievement. Our Commander in Chief is proud of his plan that puts Iran on the path to getting a nuclear weapon. He is proud of his plan that condones and facilitates U.S. business with Iran. In September, the Treasury Department authorized the sale of up to 97 Airbus and Boeing planes to Iran. Iran is more than just a labeled state sponsor of terrorism. Iran uses its financial sector for international money laundering. Iran has been a long-time supporter of the brutal Assad regime in Syria. It has supported a government that has killed hundreds of thousands of its own people. Iran's leader has pledged to wipe America and Israel off the map, but none of these facts matter to the Obama administration. They will do whatever they can just to make a deal and ensure a legacy. Mr. Speaker, why are we rewarding and aiding a nation that has contributed to so much disorder and destruction in the Middle East? To me, it is simply a no-brainer. We must not authorize U.S. aircraft sales to Iran. I urge my colleagues to pass H.R. 5711, which would prohibit the Treasury Secretary from authorizing U.S. financing in connection with commercial passenger aircraft to Iran. In God we trust. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I would like to share a portion of a letter from J Street: J Street Calls on Members of Congress to Oppose Anti-JCPOA Bill Restricting Commercial Aircraft Sales. The last paragraph says: ``Additionally, the bill would not even achieve its intended objective of preventing Iran from acquiring commercial aircraft--it would merely ensure that Iran purchases them from a foreign producer, pointlessly denying jobs and income to working Americans and communities across the country. Like so many of the legislative attempts by JCPOA opponents to undermine or kill the agreement, this bill is just another cynical messaging exercise that hurts rather than helps America's essential interests, security, and standing in the world. ``J Street therefore urges Members of Congress to oppose H.R. 5711 and reaffirm the United States' commitment to uphold its international obligations.'' Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Poliquin), a distinguished member of the House Financial Services Committee. Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Huizenga and also Chairman Hensarling for bringing this very important issue before the American people. Mr. Speaker, it is a horrible idea to allow the United States Government to help the Iranian Government support terrorism. This bill helps make sure that does not happen. Now, the world knows that the Iranian Government has a very long history of using their state-owned Iran Air to transport weapons and military personnel for the Revolutionary Guard, which, in turn, trains, arms, and funds [[Page H6261]] terrorist organizations around the world. The Revolutionary Guard and the Government of Iran has American blood on its hands. It should be very concerning to everybody in this Chamber, Republicans and Democrat, that the Iranian leaders for years have chanted, Death to America, and have vowed to wipe the State of Israel off the map. The Iranian Government cannot be trusted. Now, the United States financial institutions should not be allowed to help the Iranian Government purchase aircraft and other equipment proven to be used for military purposes. Mr. Speaker, this bill, H.R. 5711, is a good, commonsense bill. I implore everybody in this Chamber, Republicans and Democrats, to do what is right and to stand up and vote ``yes'' for H.R. 5711 to make sure we do not assist the chief sponsor of terrorism in this world to conduct its activities. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I like Mr. Poliquin. He is a nice man. He always has a nice smile. But I don't trust him more than I trust J Street. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I would like to inquire as to the balance of the time remaining on both sides. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Knight). The gentleman from Michigan has 10\1/2\ minutes remaining. The gentlewoman from California has 10\1/4\ minutes remaining. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill), who is a member of the Financial Services Committee and a former Treasury official. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Michigan for yielding. I rise in strong support of H.R. 5711. And I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman), who serves on our committee, for his leadership on this measure and consistently works on matters concerning Iran, as well as Mr. Roskam of Illinois. I was proud to be a member this past Congress on the Financial Services Committee Task Force to Investigate Terrorism Financing. During our hearings, Mr. Speaker, we heard numerous witnesses describe Iran's support for terrorism and other evil activities. It is really staggering, Mr. Speaker, that we sit here tonight and we have a Member of the other party suggest that Iran is a friend to the United States. There is no friendship between Iran and the United States or our allies. I think that is a stunning thing to say on the House floor. You have heard tonight about Iran's direct involvement in conflicts in Iraq, Syria, Yemen; their support of Hamas, Hezbollah. And one of the main methods they use to support their terrorist activities around the world is they are flying commercial aircraft by the Quds Force around this world supporting terrorism, supplying Assad in Syria, who is responsible for the deaths of hundreds. This deal is not about blocking airplane sales, Mr. Speaker. This deal is about protecting taxpayers on financing airplane sales, protecting our banks in the financing of airplane sales. In fact, Mr. Speaker, the Obama administration has already provided the Government of Iran, the mullahs in Iran over $100 billion in freed-up cash and has given them $1.7 billion in Euros in cash on pallets. Let them use that to buy an aircraft. Let's assume they cost $100 million, $150 million. They can buy several aircraft and pay cash, thanks to the failed diplomacy of the Obama administration. So, again, this legislation is about the belief that the United States should not directly support terrorism and the killing of innocent civilians. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I support this bill. It is the mission of Iran to use these aircraft for nefarious purposes. We already have that guilt on our hands by the release of $100 billion and $1.7 billion in cash. Let's not compound the errors of the past by opposing this bill, which will limit taxpayer risk and our financial sector risk at financing aircraft to Iran. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the balance of my time? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan has 8 minutes remaining. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Dold), a distinguished Member, friend, and former member of the House Financial Services Committee. Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend from Michigan for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I just find it fascinating that here we are again. Listen, we can talk about the JCPOA, this Iran nuclear deal, which I think is a historic mistake, which will haunt us for generations. There is no question about that. If anybody was unclear about where I stand or where I think many in this body stand, let me just simply say that I think this will be a historic mistake that will haunt us. Ultimately, when we are talking about the world's greatest state sponsor of terrorism, what is amazing to me is the fact that this is not even up for debate in the administration. The administration will tell you: Yes, Iran is the world's greatest state sponsor of terror. And you know what? With this agreement, if our destination was to say, You know what, we want to ensure that Iran is never able to get a nuclear weapon, this deal all but ensures it. Bob Menendez, a Democrat over in the Senate, said those very words. Prime Minister Netanyahu says this is a historic mistake. So, yes, we can talk about some of the others over there who believe this is a good thing, but ultimately we realize this is a bad thing. This is a bad thing because, frankly, as we talk about quoting J Street on the floor, I personally want to say that I will trust Bruce Poliquin from Maine, my colleague on the Financial Services Committee. When it comes to a financing bill, yes, I trust Bruce Poliquin a heck of a lot more than I trust J Street. J Street, frankly, is in the tank for the other side. They are not an objective body, I believe. Ultimately, as we look at this bill, Mr. Speaker, this bill doesn't prevent the sale of aircraft. As much as I would like to prevent the sale of aircraft to the world's greatest state sponsor of terror, which could use the aircraft to send supplies and soldiers--because we know that Iran is sending money and supplies to Hezbollah, Hamas, to Assad in Syria. Frankly, this administration will tell you the same thing. This is a bill that prevents the financing. Ultimately, as we look at, how do we protect taxpayer dollars, how do we protect the deposits of millions of Americans that go to Main Street and deposit in their local banks? We are just saying, you can't use financing to go finance the planes that are going over into Iran, the world's greatest state sponsor of terror. If they want to pay cash, it would be one thing to say, You know what? I don't think you have got any cash. Wait, we know they have got cash. Why? Because we just sent an unmarked plane with unmarked bills full of cash, ultimately, we know, for the release of hostages. We have got $1.7 billion that we know is there. We have got $100 billion worth of sanctions relief. You know what, I am counting on the fact that they have got the resources to spend. So what this is doing is this is trying to protect the American taxpayer. Ultimately, what we do know, the administration agrees to authorize the export of civilian aircraft to Iran. That still can happen. This bill does not change that one iota. What it does do is it says that you cannot use U.S. financing for those sales. Ultimately, I think that is a good thing because when we look and we want to go back and they want to talk about it, this is something about the JCPOA, the Iran deal. What is interesting to me, Mr. Speaker, is that the only thing that was bipartisan in the Iran deal was its opposition in this body to that deal. Frankly, I think we ought to be doing everything in our power to make sure that we keep and hold Iran accountable, and we should not be financing planes that go in there because, ultimately, we know they have already [[Page H6262]] fired missiles. Right? They have already broken their agreements. They have fired missiles. They have fired weapons over at U.S. ships. They have captured U.S. sailors. They are taking hostages. This is not a good actor. Frankly, we should be doing everything in our power to make sure that we are holding them accountable and ratcheting up sanctions. We should not make it easier for them to be able to purchase planes. Frankly, we have got all manufacturers that are out there that have parts in the United States that would be implicated with this. So this is not singling out a single U.S. carrier. We want to talk about pro-growth, but what we don't want to do is talk about pro-growth opportunities that are going to help the world's greatest state sponsor of terror. This is a mistake if we do not pass this piece of legislation. I am confident that this bipartisan piece of legislation is going to be able to pass this House. My hope is that the Senate will take it up. I don't believe that the President will sign it--and I think that will be a mistake--but that should not prevent this body from doing the right thing. So, Mr. Speaker, I am going to go right back to where we started at the beginning. The world's greatest state sponsor of terror should not be aided by the U.S. taxpayer, by our banking system, in order to finance planes that we really don't know what they are going to do with them. But what we do know is that Iran is a bad actor and they are going to continue to be the world's greatest state sponsor of terror. So I am going to urge my colleagues to support this bill. It is a commonsense piece of bipartisan legislation. I want to thank the chairman for his work on it, and I want to thank Chairman Hensarling as well. I want to thank Mr. Roskam, and I want to thank everybody here who is going to stand up united to say, this is going to something that we need to hold Iran accountable to. {time} 1845 Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I am prepared to close. I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I was surprised to hear the gentleman from Illinois just repeating some of the outrageous statements that Mr. Trump made during the campaign where he talked about the airplane carrying billions of dollars to Iran. I guess we are going to be hearing a lot of that around here. Mr. Speaker, next year, President-elect Trump will face a daunting array of international challenges. The most pressing of these will be curbing Islamic terrorism, reining in Russian corruption and hegemony, and dealing with the civil wars in Iraq and Syria. The self-proclaimed Islamic State, though it is in retreat in Iraq and Syria, has demonstrated its ability to operate beyond the confines of the Middle East and sponsor attacks in Asia, Europe, and the United States. Moreover, the nuclear threat posed by North Korea will require an immediate and coherent policy response from the Trump administration. So if ever there was a time when the U.S. should be affirming our commitment to the international agreements that promote our stability and security in such a volatile global environment, the time is now. We should be working to reassure our allies and the rest of the world that the U.S. is committed to internationalism and to shaping and preserving the world economic and political order. Yet, Republicans are intent on playing politics and continuing their futile attempts to undermine the Iran nuclear agreement and put the global community at risk of a nuclear Iran. Over the past few months, this House passed Republican bills to reinstate a program denying Iranian financial institutions access to U.S. dollars; to prohibit the U.S. from buying heavy water from Iran, a key component for some nuclear reactors; and most recently, to prohibit so-called ransom payments to Iran, which would, in fact, put the U.S. in violation of its international obligations under the Algiers Accords, which have been in effect since 1981, under both Republican and Democratic administrations. The White House has issued a statement of policy making it clear that the President would veto the bill before us today, stating: ``The United States has a long tradition of remaining faithful to our commitments and our international partners, and a reversal of this principle undercuts our credibility, diminishes our ability to lead globally, and threatens the very alliances we rely upon in implementing the JCPOA.'' We know that this bill would violate a key provision of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that specifically committed to the sale of commercial planes to Iran by prohibiting our financial institutions from facilitating those sales. It also would put U.S. aircraft manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage with their foreign competitors, whose access to financing would not be subject to the same constraints. The legislation is also concerning because it would remove the President's national security waiver with regard to restrictions on the Export-Import Bank's ability to finance exports to Iran. While the administration has never exercised this authority, I believe removing the President's discretion and leverage on critical national security matters would be a serious mistake. So I strongly oppose this bill that aims to undo the hard-fought progress to contain Iran's nuclear ambitions and undercuts our ability to exercise global leadership, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, to quote the great American President, Ronald Reagan: ``There you go again.'' Attack the President-elect, and try to throw out red herrings. The bill that we have before us has two simple titles, the Iran Financing Prohibition--and I will read section 101: ``The Secretary of the Treasury may not authorize a transaction by a U.S. financial institution.'' Section 102, Revocation of Prior Authorizations: ``If the Secretary of the Treasury authorized any transaction described under section 101 before the date of the enactment of this title, such authorization is hereby revoked.'' We are halfway through. Section 2, Title II, No Ex-Im Assistance for Terrorism. It simply says that there is a prohibition--on section 202: ``Prohibition on Export-Import Bank Financing that would Benefit Iran.'' That means direct financing. That would be subhead A. Indirect Financing, meaning you can't have a third party get that lending from the Export-Import Bank, by the way, a U.S. taxpayer-funded bank. So that is subhead B. And C is Cancellation of Approved Financing, if they have done that already. This bill is not that complicated, and this bill does not cite any particular company. It does not limit any company from selling aircraft to Iran, no matter how big of a mistake that might be. It simply says--as I might add, Secretary Jack Lew, Secretary of the Treasury, said in April of this year: There will be no U.S. financial institution financing this deal. And we have added that second section, that second title that says: There will be no use of the U.S. taxpayer- financed Export-Import Bank. That is all this bill says. So you have heard attacks on the President-elect. You have heard attacks on the Export-Import Bank and whether this is going to be good or bad for U.S. employers and employees. The simple fact is, Mr. Speaker, that this bill, H.R. 5711, says: We are not going to allow U.S. financial institutions, and U.S. financial institutions only, to be used to finance these deals; and we are not going to allow the Export-Import Bank of the United States to be used, either directly or indirectly, to finance that deal. Iran can go put this deal together with other banks in Asia, Europe, anywhere else in the world that they can find it, but not here in the United States and not using taxpayer dollars. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support [[Page H6263]] H.R. 5711, the No U.S. Financing for Iran Act, introduced by my good friend Bill Huizenga. This bill also includes the outstanding work of my good friend Peter Roskam, who introduced H.R. 5715, the No Ex-Im Assistance for Terrorism Act. Mr. Speaker, President Obama has made an endless stream of concessions to the Iranian government. Most recently, in September, the administration announced that it would issue special export licenses for Boeing and Airbus to sell dozens of commercial aircraft to Iran--a deal that together is valued at upwards of $50 billion. Yet the deal is not finalized because Iran is having difficulty financing it. The No U.S. Financing for Iran Act will guarantee that the U.S. plays no part in facilitating this financing: it blocks the Treasury Department from authorizing U.S. financial institutions from supporting such transactions and prevents the U.S. Export-Import Bank from extending direct or indirect credit to the Government of Iran. Although the Ex-Im Bank is prohibited from providing direct financing to Iran, it could do so through a third-party. For instance, Reuters last week reported that after months of negotiations, Iran secured financing possibly through an Emirati leasing company for the first 17 planes it plans to buy from Airbus. If the U.S. Ex-Im Bank were to provide financing to such a third-party company, it would in effect be facilitating Iran's purchase of the aircraft. It is important to recall why Iran should not be receiving these planes in the first place: until President Obama implemented his nuclear deal, Iran Air had for over four years been subject to U.S. sanctions due to the company's notorious working relationship with Iran's military and Revolutionary Guards Corps. For years, Iran Air has smuggled rockets, missiles, and other sensitive materiel aboard its passenger and cargo planes bound for regional hotspots, such as Syria, home to Iranian terrorist proxies and murderous regimes. The Obama Administration was absolutely wrong to drop these sanctions in connection with the nuclear deal because this support has little or nothing to do with Iran's nuclear program. On the contrary, much of this activity is related to Iran's sponsorship of terrorism--for which the United States still imposes sanctions on Iran. It is long past time for the Administration to stop accommodating this genocidal regime and rather hold it to account. Just last week the IAEA reported that Iran had for the second time this year exceeded its quota for heavy water as stipulated in the nuclear deal. But instead of calling this violation what it is, the Obama Administration chose to sweep it under the rug. Such passivity in the face of Iranian violations only emboldens the regime to see what more it can get away with. This is a dangerous game to play when the consequences are so grave for our national security and that of our close ally Israel. The Administration's nuclear deal with Iran itself contained far too many major concessions: it recognized Iran's right to enrichment, despite longstanding United States policy against such recognition, and settled for a weak inspections regime that is anything but ``anytime, anywhere.'' We must act again today to put a stop to the concessions. For that reason, I urge my colleagues to pass this urgent measure. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate on the bill has expired. Amendment No. 1 Printed in Part A of House Report 114-818 Offered by Mr. Huizenga of Michigan Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 1, before line 1, insert the following: SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``No U.S. Financing for Iran Act''. Page 1, line 7, strike ``that is ordinarily incident to'' and insert ``in connection with''. Page 4, after line 3, insert the following: TITLE III--SUNSET SEC. 301. SUNSET. This Act and the amendment made by this Act shall cease to be effective on the date that is 30 days after the date on which the President certifies to Congress that the Government of Iran has ceased providing support for acts of international terrorism. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 921, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, at this point my amendment adds a short title and clarifies the nature of prohibited Iranian transactions. The amendment also provides for a sunset of the bill's provision upon presidential certification that Iran has ceased support of international terrorism. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this amendment and the underlying bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. HECK of Washington. The key change made by this amendment is to strike the phrase ``ordinarily incident to'' and insert ``in connection with.'' One is a term of art commonly used by the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC. Companies doing business with an OFAC license know what that means. In connection with is a much broader term, not clearly defined, Mr. Speaker, and if this amendment were to pass, exactly how attenuated of a connection would be impermissible? Crickets, because we don't know. I believe the chilling effect of this language would go far beyond the purported intent of this legislation. And let there be no confusion what the intent is, which is to block a single legal, fully compliant, and scandal-free business transaction that supports both our national security and American manufacturing. If this bill became law, we would be less safe. The U.S. specifically committed in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or the Iran Deal, as we refer to it, to allow the sale of commercial aircraft to Iran, as well as the provision of associated services. Associated services is specifically defined in the relevant section of the agreement to include financial services of the kind U.S. banks would be specifically blocked from providing under this bill. Well, it is hard to think of anything that would be a clearer violation of our own commitments under the JCPOA, an action that would give Iran a meaningful reason to walk away from the whole thing, making us less safe. It is a clear, black-and-white violation of the JCPOA. And what is our plan B if Congress provokes the collapse of this agreement? Crickets. We don't have one. Think of how much went into the successful negotiation of the agreement. We had to convince a lot of countries, with whom we don't often always agree, to maintain a united front for U.N. sanctions to be effective. If we choose to burn down the JCPOA, which this will do, entirely of our own volition, are my colleagues under any illusion that we could simply go back to our partners, not to mention Iran, and say with a straight face: Well, let's start over. And why wouldn't Iran just happily revel in the unraveling of the mighty international coalition which brought them to the table and go back to building up its nuclear program again? Again, crickets, because they would be likely to. So let's be clear. Yes, we continue to have numerous and serious differences with Iran. But as we counter their destabilizing behavior in other parts of the Middle East, I know I sleep better at night knowing that the Iran deal prevents them from obtaining a nuclear bomb with which to set off either a regional arms race or threaten our allies with nuclear blackmail. And frankly, if Iran is going to get new planes--and nothing in this bill will stop them, the choice is really not whether it is going to be Boeing or Airbus--I sleep better at night knowing that you have got American eyes on that plane in the form of the after-sale services for parts repair and American hands doing the maintenance to guard against the diversion from legitimate civil aviation use. It keeps us more safe if these are American-made planes. But even if we ignore all the compelling evidence that this bill will make us less safe, this bill fails spectacularly at preventing Iran from buying airplanes. In fact, I am certain it would hurt our own aerospace industry way more than it would hurt Iran. It is easy for foreign companies to get around this bill. They easily go to non-U.S. banks for financing. But American companies don't have that option to cut out U.S. banks entirely, unless you prefer that the proceeds from a sale be kept offshore, that American workers and communities [[Page H6264]] never see a dime of reinvestment, and the more than 100,000 jobs this transaction could support go to other countries. This bill is also an attack on a key pillar of support for our exporters, including the aerospace exporters, namely, the Ex-Im Bank. Despite the fact that the Ex-Im Bank already has a policy against this, despite the fact that there is law against this, despite the fact that the Ex-Im has said they won't do this, and despite the fact that the seller, Boeing, has said in writing they won't do this. This isn't belts and suspenders. This is stapling your pants to your flesh. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this bill that undermines foundational elements of our national and economic security, and, in so doing, I too am reminded of what President Reagan once said: ``It's not what you don't know that bothers me, it's what you think you know that ain't so.'' Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Washington, who has been a big proponent of the Export-Import Bank and a particular company that he was alluding to and talking about, knows, though, that this bill would apply to any aircraft that the Treasury authorizes for Iran. That includes the 17 Airbus planes for Iran Air. And he brought up, actually, offshore profits. Well, according to Bloomberg, Boeing has $800 million--$800 million in profits stashed offshore; and the reports are that Boeing is pursuing these deals with the Japanese bank already, not a U.S. bank. And apparently the company is less worried about this bill and that financing than my friend from Washington is. {time} 1900 So this is simply about saying that Iran does not have direct access to the U.S. financial system. I don't understand why my friends and colleagues on the other side of the aisle are so freaked out by that. This is simply about making sure that our banking system is not going to finance this deal indirectly or directly and that the use of the Export-Import Bank would be prohibited. This amendment says it is a sunset to this bill upon Presidential certification that Iran has ceased support of international terrorism-- a goal we all have. So if the President can support that and certify that, then this falls away. So we do not say that this deal is not allowed. We simply say that U.S. financial institutions cannot be used for this and that we cannot and will not use the Export-Import Bank--a U.S. taxpayer-funded entity--to do this. At the end of the day, in April of this past year, Secretary Jack Lew told us that there will be no access; and either he misled the United States citizens and this body at that time or they changed their mind. They haven't told us which, but neither one is acceptable. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the previous question is ordered on the bill, as amended, and on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga). The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga). The amendment was agreed to. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. Motion to Recommit Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill? Mr. SWALWELL of California. I am opposed in its current form. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: Mr. Swalwell of California moves to recommit the bill H.R. 5711 to the Committee on Financial Services with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith with the following amendment: Page 2, after line 2, insert the following new section: SEC. 103. PROTECTING U.S. ELECTIONS. The Secretary of the Treasury may not authorize a transaction described under section 101 by a U.S. financial institution if such institution is engaged in business with a foreign entity that has been found by the Secretary, in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, to have engaged in or authorized cyber attacks targeting any election held in the United States. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion. Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended. Mr. Speaker, this final amendment says plainly that no U.S. business may do business with a country that has used cyber attacks to undermine a U.S. election. So if my colleagues are genuine in believing that Iran is a hopeless adversary, then surely they will join me in believing that Russia, in its efforts to undermine our recent November election, should also be treated as such. This motion is really about the future of two U.S. adversaries: Iran and Russia. Iran, surely a bad actor over the last few decades, has finally in the last couple of years come to the international table and struck an agreement with the United States and many of our allies to make sure that we take it from being a country that is 3 months away from having a nuclear weapon to 1 year away. They continue to sponsor terrorism across the world. But today, better than ever before, we have eyes, ears, and checks and balances on them that we have never had. By the way, we can address all of their bad behavior with them being much farther away from having a nuclear weapon than they were before the Iran nuclear agreement. Russia, however, continues to wreak chaos in the Middle East supporting Syria and its brutal dictator Assad. Russia brought down a commercial airliner over Ukraine and has further incurred into Ukraine taking over Crimea. Russia continues to attack and escalate hostilities with U.S. personnel at our embassy in Moscow. Now the standard bearer for the Republican Party, President-elect Trump, has chosen to embrace Russia and take the United States on a new tack. So the question today is: If you believe Iran is hopeless, then do you believe that we should also make sure no U.S. business does business with a country that is trying to undermine our elections? I want to go through some of that evidence. On October 7 of this year, Director of National Intelligence Clapper said that the intelligence community is confident that the Russian Government directed cyber attacks aimed at disrupting our November elections. Why would Russia do this? Russia clearly had a favored candidate in this race in President- elect Trump. Russia has been successful. This amendment says that you cannot do business with any country that is trying to influence our elections. This amendment says that if you think Iran is a bad actor, then you have to treat Iran the same way you treat Russia. This amendment says that if you think the U.S. should allow businesses to do business with a country trying to undermine our elections, to undermine the will of our constituents, then you should vote against this amendment. If you are with Russia, then you should be against this motion. However, if you believe that we are closer to preventing Iran from having a nuclear weapon than we were a year ago, and if you believe that it is better for a U.S. manufacturer to provide commercial airliners to Iran and create U.S. jobs and have eyes and ears on what is going on over there, then you should be for this motion. But if you want our elections to be free and fair from outside influence, then vote for this motion. If you want to stand with Russia, then you should vote against this motion. So I ask my colleagues on the other side: Are you going to embrace the new U.S. foreign policy that your standard bearer has proposed, that we are going to undermine and unravel the agreement that we have struck with Iran and march millions of young men and women back into the Middle East, an area where we have not had major combat operations finally for the first time [[Page H6265]] in 15 years? Or do you think that we should treat Iran the same way that we are treating Russia? So I submit that to my colleagues, and I invite them to maybe engage on that question because that is what this motion is about: Do you stand with Russia? Or do you stand with preventing U.S. businesses from doing business with a country that our intelligence community has said has tried to undermine our elections? Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Well, America, you just heard a ridiculous straw-man choice laid out in front of you. Mr. Speaker, this is not about anything other than selling and financing aircraft sales to Iran. That is what this bill is about. This is what this bill should be about. I will point out to my colleague that there are some pretty major kinetic activities--I believe they are called at this point, which means shooting war--happening in Mosul and other places where our troops are involved. But at the end of the day, Mr. Speaker, I want to encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this motion to recommit. I look forward to working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to address concerns that we may have with other foreign governments in the future, and I would request that they vote for the underlying bill, H.R. 5711. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the order of the House of today, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [House] [Pages H6255-H6265] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PROHIBITING THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY FROM AUTHORIZING CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS RELATING TO COMMERCIAL PASSENGER AIRCRAFT TO IRAN Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 921, I call up the bill (H.R. 5711) to prohibit the Secretary of the Treasury from authorizing certain transactions by a U.S. financial institution in connection with the export or re-export of a commercial passenger aircraft to the Islamic Republic of Iran, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 921, in lieu of the amendment recommended by the Committee on Financial Services printed in the bill, an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 114-66 is adopted, and the bill, as amended, is considered read. The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows: H.R. 5711 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, TITLE I--IRAN FINANCING PROHIBITION SECTION 101. PROHIBITION. The Secretary of the Treasury may not authorize a transaction by a U.S. financial institution (as defined under section 561.309 of title 31, Code of Federal Regulations) that is ordinarily incident to the export or re-export of a commercial passenger aircraft to the Islamic Republic of Iran. SEC. 102. REVOCATION OF PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS. If the Secretary of the Treasury authorized any transaction described under section 101 before the date of the enactment of this title, such authorization is hereby revoked. TITLE II--NO EX-IM ASSISTANCE FOR TERRORISM SEC. 201. SHORT TITLE. This title may be cited as the ``No Ex-Im Assistance for Terrorism Act''. [[Page H6256]] SEC. 202. PROHIBITION ON EXPORT-IMPORT BANK FINANCING THAT WOULD BENEFIT IRAN. Section 2(b) of the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 (12 U.S.C. 635(b)) is amended by adding at the end the following: ``(14) Prohibition on Financing That Would Benefit Iran.-- ``(A) Direct financing.--The Bank shall not guarantee, insure, or extend (or participate in an extension of) credit in connection with any transaction with respect to which credit assistance from the Bank is first sought after the effective date of this paragraph by-- ``(i) the Government of Iran or an entity owned or controlled by the Government of Iran; or ``(ii) an entity created under Iranian law, or a foreign subsidiary of such an entity. ``(B) Indirect financing.--The Bank shall not guarantee, insure, or extend (or participate in an extension of) credit in connection with any transaction with respect to which credit assistance from the Bank is first sought after the effective date of this paragraph involving-- ``(i) an entity for the purpose of a transaction involving the Government of Iran or an entity referred to in subparagraph (A); or ``(ii) a non-United States entity that, in the 5-year period ending with the date of the enactment of this paragraph, has leased or sold aircraft to the Government of Iran or an entity referred to in subparagraph (A) in contravention of United States law, or a subsidiary or controlling parent of such a non-United States entity. ``(C) Cancellation of approved financing.--The Bank shall cease the provision of financial assistance approved by the Bank in connection with a transaction with respect to which credit assistance from the Bank is approved after the effective date of this paragraph, on finding that the assistance has facilitated the export, sale, or lease of an aircraft to an entity referred to in subparagraph (A), and shall seek immediate recovery of any amount provided by the Bank in connection with the transaction.''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill shall be debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and the ranking minority member of the Committee on Financial Services. After 1 hour of debate, it shall be in order to consider the further amendment printed in part A of House Report 114-818, if offered by the Member designated in the report, which shall be considered read and shall be separately debatable for the time specified in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent. The gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine Waters) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. General Leave Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to submit extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. When our fellow Americans deposit their earnings in a U.S. bank or entrust the government with their tax dollars, they do so assuming that their money will not be used in ways which undermine the security of our very Nation and, frankly, of the world. The legislation we are debating tonight is a package of bills that is designed to prevent the Obama administration from further undermining the trust of the American people and the security of our Nation, as well as the security of our allies. Under President Obama's nuclear deal with Iran, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or the JCPOA, the administration agreed to authorize the export of civilian aircraft to Iran. What the JCPOA did not include was authorization for the U.S. financing of those sales. As Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said in April in a Council on Foreign Relations speech: ``Iran, complied with the nuclear agreement. Therefore, the nuclear sanctions are lifted. I think that that is a process that is becoming more and more clear. And we'll keep our part of the bargain there. But the U.S. financial system is not open to Iran and that is not something that is going to change.'' Again, that was Secretary Jack Lew in April of this past year. Mr. Speaker, something changed. In September, the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control issued licenses to Airbus and to Boeing that permitted the sale of up to 97 airplanes to Iran Air, the country's flagship, state-owned carrier. These licenses didn't stop there, however. By going beyond the scope of the JCPOA, they also authorized U.S. financial institutions to ``engage in all transactions necessary to provide financing or other financial services'' related to the Iran Air orders. My bill, H.R. 5711, would prohibit the Secretary of the Treasury from authorizing U.S. financing through American banks in connection with the export of commercial aircraft to Iran just as the administration claimed was U.S. policy to begin with. This bill would keep Americans' deposits away from a country that the President's own State Department calls ``the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism'' and which the Treasury has designated as ``a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern.'' Let me repeat that. The State Department, itself, says this is the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism, and the Treasury Department has designated a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern. How many more red flags need to go up? Under this bill, Americans would not have to fear that their savings are being channeled to Iran Air, which was sanctioned by the Treasury in 2011 for ferrying soldiers and weapons of war to Syria--the site of a 5-year conflict that has claimed a half a million lives and has displaced millions more. This is the same Iran Air that a U.N. report concluded had shared ballistic military technology with North Korea and is the same Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps whose deputy commander called for an end to Israel, making note of more than 100,000 missiles that were ready ``for the annihilation--the wiping out--and the collapse of the Zionist regime.'' Additionally, research by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies shows that Iran Air's support of the Assad regime continues to this very day. Why should U.S. banks and their customers be implicated in Iranian atrocities? I would submit that there is no reasonable answer to this, which is why this commonsense prohibition, when offered as an amendment to this year's Financial Services appropriations bill, was passed by this very body--the House of Representatives--by a voice vote. However, this bill goes even further, Mr. Speaker. Not only will H.R. 5711 protect Americans' bank accounts, it will prevent their tax dollars from being used through the Export-Import Bank to subsidize aircraft sales to Iran. It would be through direct transactions or third-party leasing, which is becoming more and more common. This codifies and strengthens an existing Ex-Im prohibition that is renewed in annual appropriations bills. For that reason, this measure enjoyed the support of Ex-Im supporters and critics alike when it came before the Financial Services Committee. H.R. 5711 combines the text of two bills that were reported by the Committee on Financial Services; one of them sponsored by me and the other by Congressman Roskam of Illinois. Both pieces of legislation were cosponsored by our Democrat colleague, Congressman Sherman of California, who has devoted years to Iran policy, both as a member of the Financial Services Committee and of the Foreign Affairs Committee. I thank Representative Sherman and Representative Roskam for working with me on this very important legislation package; and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this important bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am disappointed that we are here, yet again, debating another Republican bill to undermine the Iran nuclear deal--a deal that, so far, has delivered on its principal goal of blocking Iran's path to nuclear weapons for the foreseeable future. This is a dangerous move that, if enacted, would put U.S. and global security at risk. Specifically, H.R. 5711 would prohibit the Treasury Secretary from authorizing any transaction by a U.S. financial institution to support the export of commercial planes to Iran. Doing so would violate a key component of the agreement in which the U.S. has committed to allowing the sales of these planes and the associated financial [[Page H6257]] services that are necessary to support the sales. Earlier this year, the Treasury Department issued a license to Boeing for the sale of 80 passenger planes to Iran--valued at $17.6 billion-- and authorized U.S. financial institutions to engage in all transactions necessary to allow Boeing to receive payment for the sale. This legislation not only puts the Boeing deal in the crosshairs by prohibiting it from conducting a lawful sale under the agreement, but it also places the viability of the nuclear deal itself in question. Moreover, this legislation would breach the good faith provision in the agreement by which all parties agreed not to undermine its successful implementation. H.R. 5711 also includes language that prevents the Export-Import Bank from financing exports to Iran, which is a red herring because the Ex- Im Bank has not supported exports to Iran since the 1970s, and it is legally prohibited from doing so as long as Iran is a state sponsor of terror. Notably, the bill removes the President's national security waiver with regard to these restrictions--a move that denies the President the flexibility that is necessary to work with our allies to find the most effective ways of changing Iran's behavior. The fact is that all previous Iran sanctions bills that have passed the House and that have become law have included a Presidential waiver that gives the President the flexibility to act quickly and maneuver when doing so serves the U.S. national security interest. Mr. Speaker, I am particularly concerned that this bill comes at a time of deep global uncertainty about U.S. foreign policy. We have a President-elect whose talk on foreign policy has ranged from vague and contradictory in some areas to utterly incoherent elsewhere. He has inserted unpredictability into the international arena, has questioned the value of U.S. alliances, and has threatened the cornerstones of decades of American foreign policy leadership. Yet, instead of reassuring the world that the United States is committed to working with our global allies to promote our collective security, House Republicans have decided to push yet another piece of legislation through the House to destabilize the agreement that is central to preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. {time} 1800 I do wonder why their leadership decided to bring this bill to the floor now in the lameduck session when they know the President will veto it. Perhaps my colleagues on the other side of the aisle know that in two short months, they will no longer have the luxury of legislating without consequences. Come January, we will have a President who has called the Iran nuclear agreement the worst deal ever negotiated. Like most of his other nonsense policies, Mr. Trump has claimed he will either more strictly enforce the agreement or negotiate ``a much better deal'' or dismantle it altogether. We don't know, and he doesn't know. So I am going to bet that, under the Trump administration, Republicans will not be so eager to move legislation to unravel this agreement because, like the rest of us, they do not know how Mr. Trump will govern and because they know there is no other reasonable approach to curbing Iran's nuclear ambition, short of military intervention. I, therefore, urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this bill and sending a strong message to the President-elect and our allies around the world that Democrats remain committed to a strong U.S. engagement in the world and will not tolerate any attempt to undermine the Iran nuclear deal or any other international arrangements that keep us safe. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Roskam), a leader on this issue who is the author of H.R. 5715. Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga) and also Chairman Hensarling for their consistent and persistent work on this issue. My friend from California mentioned a minute ago her disappointment. Well, if you want to talk about disappointment and destabilizing of the deal, just look at what the Iranians have done since the JCPOA passed. By the way, a majority of the House of Representatives and a majority of the United States Senate, not on a partisan basis either, Mr. Speaker, voted against the JCPOA. So let's put that in context. But the President insisted, he moved along, and here we are. So let's see what we can do about it. Before we fix it, let's look at what the Iranians have done. They are the destabilizers. There have been Iranian-supplied rockets launched at a U.S. Naval ship. Iran has fired rockets within 1,500 feet in December of last year on U.S. ships numerous times. The IRGC patrol boats have aggressively harassed U.S. ships in the Strait of Hormuz. Iran has launched numerous ballistic missile tests in violation of the U.N. Security Council resolutions. They violated the JCPOA by producing excess heavy water. They continue to kidnap Americans and hold them for ransom. So let's put it where it lies. The destabilizing impact doesn't belong with the United States. It doesn't belong with any statement by an American policyholder. The destabilizing nature belongs, Mr. Speaker, to the Iranian regime, the mullahs themselves. So the gentlewoman from California said she is disappointed. Well, look, I mean, disappointment, get used to it. It is the nature of things. The nature of the disappointment is that we now have American companies that are saying: You know what? Let's go in and let's do business with a terrorist regime. How is that? Let's just go make a buck. That is the scandal of this. The scandal is that there are American companies, there are international companies--Boeing, Airbus--that are now making their own names inextricably linked with terror forever more. That is the scandal. So what are we trying to do? The gentlewoman said that the Ex-Im elements of this--I think she said--was a red herring. If not, it was words to that effect. No, it is not so. Because if you look carefully at what the Ex-Im prohibition actually prohibits, Mr. Speaker, it prohibits the direct financing to the Iranian regime. Fine, if that is all this did, well and good. There is no reason to oppose it, then. Of course, that is not where the Ex-Im is actually limited. Because here is what can happen: under current law, the Ex-Im Bank can do a deal with the Europeans, for example. What can happen, then? That can be leased under current law to the Iranians. This amendment, Mr. Huizenga's language, would prohibit that. That is what we are trying to do. Look, think about the irony of this. You have got an administration that currently is telling Americans it is a dangerous thing to go to Iran; that you are at risk of being kidnapped if you go to Iran. At the same time--picture this, Mr. Speaker--that that is being articulated, they are also saying: We are going to help you do some business over there. That is ridiculous. It is absurd, it is contradictory, and it is indefensible. So here is the good news: The good news is we can do something about it. The other good news is this Iran deal has a very short shelf life because the President-elect has said he doesn't like it. President Obama didn't do the hard work of developing a national consensus on it. If he had, it would have been a treaty and a treaty that would have bound the United States in permanency; but he didn't do that. Why? Because it was a bad idea and he couldn't sell it to Congress. So he went the easy way, did it basically by executive order. And what goes around comes around. So we can do some good work here today. We can move this out. Is President Obama going to sign it? Obviously not, but that is not to say that it is not what we should do. We know what we need to do. We need to make sure that the American financial system is not complicit in this deal. We need to make sure that American taxpayers are not subsidizing this deal. I urge the bill's passage. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Himes), a member of the Financial Services Committee and the House [[Page H6258]] Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, with all due respect to the gentleman from Michigan, once again, we find ourselves in this dreary and dangerous ritual of considering a bill which, without question, would cause us to violate our agreement under the JCPOA. We get the same arguments about how bad the Iranian regime is, and we get the same misstatements like: This is President Obama's deal. It is not President Obama's deal. It is a deal of the United Nations Security Council, of China, of Russia, of Great Britain, of France, of Germany, the U.K., and the rest of the world who combined working for a period of almost 15 years hammered out a deal--and I say this as a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence--which today has removed Iran as a nuclear threat. Yet, here again, we are offered a bill that would compromise our obligations and almost certainly result in centrifuges spinning once again in Tehran and then leading on to the very likely prospect of yet another Middle Eastern war. Yes, Iran is a sponsor of terrorism. Yes, it is a bad place. You will get no argument from this side of the aisle that this is a bad regime. Once again, I remind my Republican friends that their patron saint, Ronald Reagan, made a nuclear deal with the Soviet Union, also a sponsor of terrorism, an appalling regime; but Ronald Reagan was smart enough to know that you can make a deal that makes everybody safer even with some very bad people. Ronald Reagan. One thing I know as a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence is that what used to be a mortal national security threat to the United States--2 to 3 months from breakout time, 2 to 3 months over which would almost certainly be involved in yet another war in the Middle East--has been taken off the table. Now, the Republicans not only seek to scuttle that deal with all of the implications, but they do it by stopping an American company from selling a flagship American product around the world. If you use the Department of Commerce's multiplier, the bill they are pushing today would result in 100,000 American jobs not created so that they can continue with this fetish of eliminating a deal, which has made us safer. If there is any question about whether this has made us safer, let me again quote General Gadi Eizenkot, who is the chief of staff of the Israeli Defense Forces. He said the deal has actually removed the most serious danger to Israel's existence for the foreseeable future and greatly reduced the threat over the longer term. That is the chief of staff of the Israeli Defense Forces, but my friends in the Republican Party know better about what is good for Israel. These sad charades end pretty soon because the bluff has been called. President Trump has said he will tear up the Iran deal. When he does that--because this, of course, is not becoming law--the centrifuges will spin again. To my friends on the other side of the aisle, when the centrifuges are spinning, we and I will stand here and we will tell the American people why centrifuges are spinning again. And where we were 2 years ago when we thought we were going to war with Iran, if we go to Iran, when Israeli planes are bombing Iran, we will stand here and explain why we are now in another Middle Eastern war. We can avoid that by ending these charades and finally accepting this deal. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot), who is the chairman of the Small Business Committee, but also a previous chair of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5711. I want to the commend my colleagues, Congressmen Huizenga and Sherman, for authoring this bipartisan piece of legislation. It was once said that the West would sell its enemies the rope that would be used to hang itself with. Well, because of the disastrously flawed Iran deal, that is exactly what we are currently doing. That is why this legislation is so important. H.R. 5711 essentially prevents the export or reexport of commercial passenger aircraft to the Islamic Republic of Iran. This bill would cut off Iran's means of delivering weapons to terrorist organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah, and to Syrian dictator Bashir al-Assad, a war criminal who is responsible for the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War. The truth is we wouldn't even need to be here today if the Obama administration had just paid attention to the facts on the ground in the Middle East. When negotiating the disastrous Iran nuclear deal, despite knowing Iran was the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, President Obama and Secretary Kerry permitted the sale of commercial aircraft to Iran anyway. Incredibly, under current U.S. law, if we issued a license for Iran Air to purchase aircraft from an American manufacturer and then Iran walked away from its commitment, U.S. taxpayers would have to foot the bill for Iran. In this case, that could be up to $70 billion on the U.S. taxpayer. Given Iran Air's multiple unpaid commitments over the years, that outrageous outcome is entirely possible. So for all of the reasons that I have mentioned and for reasons that have been stated already by my colleagues, I would urge clear-minded people on both sides of the aisle to support this legislation. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Price), a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee. Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 5711. This legislation is only the latest misguided and politicized effort by the majority to undermine the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, a historic agreement negotiated by the world's major powers in order to keep Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. Simply put, enactment of H.R. 5711 would violate the United States Government's obligations under the JCPOA, opening the door for Iran to walk away from this agreement. It also threatens to undermine our credibility with our allies and negotiating partners. Now, we must be vigilant. No one disagrees that we must be vigilant in ensuring Iranian compliance with the terms of the JCPOA. We also should continue to hold Iran to account for its violations of human rights, for its sponsorship of terrorism, and for its nonnuclear weapons development. Last night, I supported, as did almost every Member of this body, a clean reauthorization of the Iran Sanctions Extension Act, which guarantees Congress' ability to snap back sanctions should Iran violate the JCPOA. The reauthorization also allows Congress to take positive action on transition day should it be verified that Iran has used its nuclear capacity only for peaceful purposes. So the continued authorization of sanctions will allow the United States to continue to exert pressure on the Iranian regime. The dangerous bill before us today will do just exactly the opposite. By directly blocking a specific provision of the JCPOA--namely, the permissible sale of commercial passenger aircraft--this legislation would send a clear message to the Iranian people that the United States does not negotiate in good faith; that we expect to have it both ways, with Iran dismantling its nuclear facilities and getting nothing in return. {time} 1815 We must also remember, my colleagues, that the Iran nuclear agreement is not just a bilateral agreement between Iran and the United States. It is the product of years and years of negotiations between Iran and the P5+1, which is the United Kingdom, China, France, Russia, Germany, and the United States. The bill before us today would break faith with those negotiating partners in a reckless and dangerous way. Because of this agreement, the breakout time for Iran to develop enough weapons-grade material for a nuclear weapon went from 2 to 3 months to a year or more. Because of this agreement, the international community has 24/7 access to Iran's nuclear sites. Because of this agreement, we possess the enforcement mechanisms necessary to verify Iran's compliance. [[Page H6259]] By all objective accounts, Iran has upheld its end of the bargain. Why would we give up these capabilities by failing to uphold ours? In light of the political transitions taking place in our country, now is especially the time when the United States must keep its word, its word to our allies and to the international community. Now, regardless of all this, it appears that our Republican colleagues are willing to jeopardize a major international agreement for political advantage. They are willing to undermine the credibility of the United States and our allies on the international stage. My colleagues, instead of scoring political points or seeking to undo the foreign policy legacy of the outgoing President, we should be working together in a bipartisan manner to ensure this agreement's success. For that reason, I urge colleagues to vote against this bill. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), a member of the House Committee on Financial Services. Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5711. Despite the President's assurances, Iran remains a menace to the stability of the Middle East and a threat to America and its allies. All of us, both Republicans and Democrats, need to take action to reduce the harm that this rogue state and its accomplices can do. H.R. 5711 takes some very important steps in that effort. By prohibiting the Secretary of the Treasury from green-lighting U.S. financing for the export of commercial aircraft to Iran, we are making it more difficult for Iranian airlines to acquire planes that we know are used to ferry soldiers and weapons. I need to ask my colleagues across the aisle: Is that such a bad idea? By blocking Ex-Im assistance to the Government of Iran, we are preventing the U.S. taxpayer from subsidizing efforts by the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism to acquire aircraft to support its deadly activities around the world. We can all agree that Ex-Im should never be used for this purpose. The Government of Iran continues to fund terrorist activities, and it is intimately involved in Syria's violent civil war. Let us not forget the recent hostile actions taken by Houthi rebels in Yemen. These rebels receive funds from Iran, and they fired missiles at U.S. Navy warships on patrol in the Red Sea. The American people cannot be complicit in these hostilities. We owe it to our constituents and our allies around the world to pass this commonsense legislation. I thank my colleagues from Michigan, Illinois, and California for introducing this bill. I urge its support. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett), a member of the Committee on Ways and Means. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, will this Congress ground Boeing or support this key manufacturer and the jobs that it creates, that have already helped make America great? Will we march to the tune of the pied pipers against peace who see war with Iran as the only way to restrain it from developing nuclear weapons? Part of what makes trade so important to us is that countries that trade together are less likely to go to war with one another. The House today is being asked to vote to block the sale of about 80 Boeing aircraft to update an aging and unsafe commercial airline in Iran. If this bill passes, that is bad news for a major American business, and it is also bad news to thousands of skilled workers across this country who won't see any part of what could be a $25 billion deal. It is great news for Boeing's major European competitor to get the work that these supporters would deny to Boeing. This is, of course, just the latest of one effort after another to undermine the only way forward, short of war, to limit Iran's ability to develop nuclear weapons. This realization is why this very week so many national security experts have urged Mr. Trump to reconsider, to reverse his threat to break the promises that our country made in an international agreement. This week also, the European Union affirmed its support for that international agreement. The six other countries that joined us in that international agreement are honoring their promises, and we should do the same thing. What will keep Boeing from flying high? It is the war hawks that fly high, so insistent on undermining this important pact that has made our family safer. If the hawks win, it is about more than losing a multibillion-dollar deal to one American manufacturer. It really means that nothing--nothing--but the threat of another American war, an American attack, will hold Iran back from developing nuclear weapons. This is about more than destabilizing the American workforce. Undermining this agreement will destabilize the Middle East. It will jeopardize our families and the families of our allies. Once again, this measure should be rejected. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Pittenger), a member of the Committee on Financial Services. Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to voice my support for H.R. 5711 and to thank Congressman Huizenga for his leadership on this very important issue. This bill prohibits the Secretary of the Treasury from authorizing certain transactions by U.S. financial institutions in connection with the export or reexport of a commercial passenger aircraft to the Islamic Republic of Iran. As the primary sponsor of terrorism throughout the world, it is imperative that we hold Iran accountable and do all we can to limit their abilities to promote this type of action and behavior. This bill confronts the same airline that has been sanctioned by the Treasury Department for transporting fighters and weapons on behalf of Iran's Revolutionary Guard. It is beyond me how the administration can be okay with allowing Iran access to airplanes which would only further their support of terrorism. I supported this commonsense legislation when it was marked up in the Committee on Financial Services, and I am proud to support it today. Thank you to my good friend, Congressman Huizenga, for sponsoring this legislation. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations on the Committee on the Judiciary. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California, Ranking Member Waters, for the leadership that she gave this issue in the Committee on Financial Services, and I rise today to offer my opposition to this bill for a number of reasons. I will say that it is interesting--I heard my colleague from North Carolina mention the Soviet Union and the interests and the efforts that President Reagan made to, in fact, make America safer in his time and in his context. Interestingly, in the backdrop of today, one could now argue that Russia has, in its portfolio, advocacy for terrorists as well as a large profile of cyberterrorism and hacking into the United States as well as a blatant interference in the most recent Presidential election. As I look to my colleagues speaking about what the President-elect will do, I would hope that he would not undermine the national security of this Nation. First of all, we know that this bill will be vetoed if it gets to the desk of President Obama. This bill would damage a hard-fought diplomatic solution that makes the world safer from nuclear war. The sanctions are working, including extensive monitoring of the nuclear capability of Iran. We also, in a bipartisan manner, supported the potential extinction of Iran sanctions yesterday, and that was the right thing to do, the opportunity or the possibility of doing that. But this bill, in particular, flies in the face of a realistic approach to how we do international engagement. The JCPOA has significantly constrained Iran's nuclear program. Key aspects of the program are dismantled under the JCPOA, and it subjects Iran's nuclear program to unprecedented verification and monitoring requirements. It is working. It is profoundly in the national security interests of the United States to continue to meet our commitments [[Page H6260]] under the JCPOA as long as Iran continues to meet its commitments. Our allies are depending on us. The word of the United States should mean something. We even know that Israel has seen a positive impact, some of its military persons have indicated, by way of the JCPOA. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman. Ms. JACKSON LEE. This bill prohibits the involvement of U.S. financial institutions in the sale of commercial passenger aircraft to Iran Air, civil end use that would put U.S. aircraft manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage with their foreign competitors whose access to financing would not be subject to the same constraints. This is not putting commercialism or jobs above national security. It is, in fact, allowing civil end use to continue as we are standing for our national security. The sweeping and vague nature of this provision would have a chilling effect on U.S. and non-U.S. entities seeking to engage in permissible business with Iran. The United States has a long tradition of remaining faithful to our commitments with our international partners, and a reversal of this principle undercuts our credibility, diminishes our ability to lead globally, and threatens the very alliances we rely upon in implementing the JCPOA. We can anticipate that should this bill become law, our closest allies would view this bill as a violation of the JCPOA commitments, and Iran would take the issue to the Joint Commission. The main thing of this bill is that it will douse the friendship and alliance that we are making with allies who want a peaceful nonproliferation of nuclear activity. This is a ``no'' vote in order to provide for the national security of this Nation. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Schweikert), a member of the House Committee on Financial Services. Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Huizenga for the couple minutes. This is one of those moments, has anyone actually read the four pages on the bill? Great. In that case, we should all know this isn't about selling jets. It is about using the American financial system to finance them. That is what the language of the bill is. Think about this. We have now spent the last 6 years around this body talking over and over and over how we are going to keep the American financial system safe, how we are going to not do things that concentrate debt within our capital markets. If Iran wants to buy jets, let them go find bilateral agreements in other countries. Let them show up with the cash. Let them go find someone else to put up the surety bonds. Let someone else go put up the coverage on the lost pieces on the ladder of the financing. This piece of legislation coming through the Committee on Financial Services is about protecting our financial system, first, from what many of us on the committee believe is going to turn into bad debt and functionally become toxic within our financial markets; but then, secondly, do you really want the United States financial system providing liquidity and financing for the leading state sponsor of terrorism in the world? That is a pretty powerful ethical question when you consider what we have been through in cleaning up our own financial system over the last few years. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am sorry that Mr. Pittenger left because I really did want to share this point with him. It is important to note that nothing in this legislation will keep new passenger aircraft out of the hands of Iran. The bill only prevents Boeing from selling civilian passenger aircraft to Iran, while foreign aircraft manufacturers, such as Airbus, will still be able to sell their passenger planes to Iran since they won't need U.S. financial institutions to help finance their deals. {time} 1830 What is this? Is this some kind of payback to Boeing? Is this some kind of---- Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Will the gentlewoman yield? Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I yield to the gentleman from Michigan. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. That is actually not true. Airbus is subject to this as well because of the significant number of parts and material in the jets that they produce. So they would be subject to this as well as Boeing. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Reclaiming my time, there is nothing in this legislation that will keep new passenger aircraft out of the hands of Iran. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Williams), who is also a member of the House Financial Services Committee. Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Huizenga for his leadership. Mr. Speaker, the Obama administration's State Department recognizes the Islamic Republic of Iran as one of three state sponsors of terrorism. But, ironically, the President calls his deal with Iran a foreign policy achievement. Our Commander in Chief is proud of his plan that puts Iran on the path to getting a nuclear weapon. He is proud of his plan that condones and facilitates U.S. business with Iran. In September, the Treasury Department authorized the sale of up to 97 Airbus and Boeing planes to Iran. Iran is more than just a labeled state sponsor of terrorism. Iran uses its financial sector for international money laundering. Iran has been a long-time supporter of the brutal Assad regime in Syria. It has supported a government that has killed hundreds of thousands of its own people. Iran's leader has pledged to wipe America and Israel off the map, but none of these facts matter to the Obama administration. They will do whatever they can just to make a deal and ensure a legacy. Mr. Speaker, why are we rewarding and aiding a nation that has contributed to so much disorder and destruction in the Middle East? To me, it is simply a no-brainer. We must not authorize U.S. aircraft sales to Iran. I urge my colleagues to pass H.R. 5711, which would prohibit the Treasury Secretary from authorizing U.S. financing in connection with commercial passenger aircraft to Iran. In God we trust. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I would like to share a portion of a letter from J Street: J Street Calls on Members of Congress to Oppose Anti-JCPOA Bill Restricting Commercial Aircraft Sales. The last paragraph says: ``Additionally, the bill would not even achieve its intended objective of preventing Iran from acquiring commercial aircraft--it would merely ensure that Iran purchases them from a foreign producer, pointlessly denying jobs and income to working Americans and communities across the country. Like so many of the legislative attempts by JCPOA opponents to undermine or kill the agreement, this bill is just another cynical messaging exercise that hurts rather than helps America's essential interests, security, and standing in the world. ``J Street therefore urges Members of Congress to oppose H.R. 5711 and reaffirm the United States' commitment to uphold its international obligations.'' Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Poliquin), a distinguished member of the House Financial Services Committee. Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Huizenga and also Chairman Hensarling for bringing this very important issue before the American people. Mr. Speaker, it is a horrible idea to allow the United States Government to help the Iranian Government support terrorism. This bill helps make sure that does not happen. Now, the world knows that the Iranian Government has a very long history of using their state-owned Iran Air to transport weapons and military personnel for the Revolutionary Guard, which, in turn, trains, arms, and funds [[Page H6261]] terrorist organizations around the world. The Revolutionary Guard and the Government of Iran has American blood on its hands. It should be very concerning to everybody in this Chamber, Republicans and Democrat, that the Iranian leaders for years have chanted, Death to America, and have vowed to wipe the State of Israel off the map. The Iranian Government cannot be trusted. Now, the United States financial institutions should not be allowed to help the Iranian Government purchase aircraft and other equipment proven to be used for military purposes. Mr. Speaker, this bill, H.R. 5711, is a good, commonsense bill. I implore everybody in this Chamber, Republicans and Democrats, to do what is right and to stand up and vote ``yes'' for H.R. 5711 to make sure we do not assist the chief sponsor of terrorism in this world to conduct its activities. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I like Mr. Poliquin. He is a nice man. He always has a nice smile. But I don't trust him more than I trust J Street. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I would like to inquire as to the balance of the time remaining on both sides. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Knight). The gentleman from Michigan has 10\1/2\ minutes remaining. The gentlewoman from California has 10\1/4\ minutes remaining. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill), who is a member of the Financial Services Committee and a former Treasury official. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Michigan for yielding. I rise in strong support of H.R. 5711. And I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman), who serves on our committee, for his leadership on this measure and consistently works on matters concerning Iran, as well as Mr. Roskam of Illinois. I was proud to be a member this past Congress on the Financial Services Committee Task Force to Investigate Terrorism Financing. During our hearings, Mr. Speaker, we heard numerous witnesses describe Iran's support for terrorism and other evil activities. It is really staggering, Mr. Speaker, that we sit here tonight and we have a Member of the other party suggest that Iran is a friend to the United States. There is no friendship between Iran and the United States or our allies. I think that is a stunning thing to say on the House floor. You have heard tonight about Iran's direct involvement in conflicts in Iraq, Syria, Yemen; their support of Hamas, Hezbollah. And one of the main methods they use to support their terrorist activities around the world is they are flying commercial aircraft by the Quds Force around this world supporting terrorism, supplying Assad in Syria, who is responsible for the deaths of hundreds. This deal is not about blocking airplane sales, Mr. Speaker. This deal is about protecting taxpayers on financing airplane sales, protecting our banks in the financing of airplane sales. In fact, Mr. Speaker, the Obama administration has already provided the Government of Iran, the mullahs in Iran over $100 billion in freed-up cash and has given them $1.7 billion in Euros in cash on pallets. Let them use that to buy an aircraft. Let's assume they cost $100 million, $150 million. They can buy several aircraft and pay cash, thanks to the failed diplomacy of the Obama administration. So, again, this legislation is about the belief that the United States should not directly support terrorism and the killing of innocent civilians. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I support this bill. It is the mission of Iran to use these aircraft for nefarious purposes. We already have that guilt on our hands by the release of $100 billion and $1.7 billion in cash. Let's not compound the errors of the past by opposing this bill, which will limit taxpayer risk and our financial sector risk at financing aircraft to Iran. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the balance of my time? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan has 8 minutes remaining. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Dold), a distinguished Member, friend, and former member of the House Financial Services Committee. Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend from Michigan for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I just find it fascinating that here we are again. Listen, we can talk about the JCPOA, this Iran nuclear deal, which I think is a historic mistake, which will haunt us for generations. There is no question about that. If anybody was unclear about where I stand or where I think many in this body stand, let me just simply say that I think this will be a historic mistake that will haunt us. Ultimately, when we are talking about the world's greatest state sponsor of terrorism, what is amazing to me is the fact that this is not even up for debate in the administration. The administration will tell you: Yes, Iran is the world's greatest state sponsor of terror. And you know what? With this agreement, if our destination was to say, You know what, we want to ensure that Iran is never able to get a nuclear weapon, this deal all but ensures it. Bob Menendez, a Democrat over in the Senate, said those very words. Prime Minister Netanyahu says this is a historic mistake. So, yes, we can talk about some of the others over there who believe this is a good thing, but ultimately we realize this is a bad thing. This is a bad thing because, frankly, as we talk about quoting J Street on the floor, I personally want to say that I will trust Bruce Poliquin from Maine, my colleague on the Financial Services Committee. When it comes to a financing bill, yes, I trust Bruce Poliquin a heck of a lot more than I trust J Street. J Street, frankly, is in the tank for the other side. They are not an objective body, I believe. Ultimately, as we look at this bill, Mr. Speaker, this bill doesn't prevent the sale of aircraft. As much as I would like to prevent the sale of aircraft to the world's greatest state sponsor of terror, which could use the aircraft to send supplies and soldiers--because we know that Iran is sending money and supplies to Hezbollah, Hamas, to Assad in Syria. Frankly, this administration will tell you the same thing. This is a bill that prevents the financing. Ultimately, as we look at, how do we protect taxpayer dollars, how do we protect the deposits of millions of Americans that go to Main Street and deposit in their local banks? We are just saying, you can't use financing to go finance the planes that are going over into Iran, the world's greatest state sponsor of terror. If they want to pay cash, it would be one thing to say, You know what? I don't think you have got any cash. Wait, we know they have got cash. Why? Because we just sent an unmarked plane with unmarked bills full of cash, ultimately, we know, for the release of hostages. We have got $1.7 billion that we know is there. We have got $100 billion worth of sanctions relief. You know what, I am counting on the fact that they have got the resources to spend. So what this is doing is this is trying to protect the American taxpayer. Ultimately, what we do know, the administration agrees to authorize the export of civilian aircraft to Iran. That still can happen. This bill does not change that one iota. What it does do is it says that you cannot use U.S. financing for those sales. Ultimately, I think that is a good thing because when we look and we want to go back and they want to talk about it, this is something about the JCPOA, the Iran deal. What is interesting to me, Mr. Speaker, is that the only thing that was bipartisan in the Iran deal was its opposition in this body to that deal. Frankly, I think we ought to be doing everything in our power to make sure that we keep and hold Iran accountable, and we should not be financing planes that go in there because, ultimately, we know they have already [[Page H6262]] fired missiles. Right? They have already broken their agreements. They have fired missiles. They have fired weapons over at U.S. ships. They have captured U.S. sailors. They are taking hostages. This is not a good actor. Frankly, we should be doing everything in our power to make sure that we are holding them accountable and ratcheting up sanctions. We should not make it easier for them to be able to purchase planes. Frankly, we have got all manufacturers that are out there that have parts in the United States that would be implicated with this. So this is not singling out a single U.S. carrier. We want to talk about pro-growth, but what we don't want to do is talk about pro-growth opportunities that are going to help the world's greatest state sponsor of terror. This is a mistake if we do not pass this piece of legislation. I am confident that this bipartisan piece of legislation is going to be able to pass this House. My hope is that the Senate will take it up. I don't believe that the President will sign it--and I think that will be a mistake--but that should not prevent this body from doing the right thing. So, Mr. Speaker, I am going to go right back to where we started at the beginning. The world's greatest state sponsor of terror should not be aided by the U.S. taxpayer, by our banking system, in order to finance planes that we really don't know what they are going to do with them. But what we do know is that Iran is a bad actor and they are going to continue to be the world's greatest state sponsor of terror. So I am going to urge my colleagues to support this bill. It is a commonsense piece of bipartisan legislation. I want to thank the chairman for his work on it, and I want to thank Chairman Hensarling as well. I want to thank Mr. Roskam, and I want to thank everybody here who is going to stand up united to say, this is going to something that we need to hold Iran accountable to. {time} 1845 Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I am prepared to close. I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I was surprised to hear the gentleman from Illinois just repeating some of the outrageous statements that Mr. Trump made during the campaign where he talked about the airplane carrying billions of dollars to Iran. I guess we are going to be hearing a lot of that around here. Mr. Speaker, next year, President-elect Trump will face a daunting array of international challenges. The most pressing of these will be curbing Islamic terrorism, reining in Russian corruption and hegemony, and dealing with the civil wars in Iraq and Syria. The self-proclaimed Islamic State, though it is in retreat in Iraq and Syria, has demonstrated its ability to operate beyond the confines of the Middle East and sponsor attacks in Asia, Europe, and the United States. Moreover, the nuclear threat posed by North Korea will require an immediate and coherent policy response from the Trump administration. So if ever there was a time when the U.S. should be affirming our commitment to the international agreements that promote our stability and security in such a volatile global environment, the time is now. We should be working to reassure our allies and the rest of the world that the U.S. is committed to internationalism and to shaping and preserving the world economic and political order. Yet, Republicans are intent on playing politics and continuing their futile attempts to undermine the Iran nuclear agreement and put the global community at risk of a nuclear Iran. Over the past few months, this House passed Republican bills to reinstate a program denying Iranian financial institutions access to U.S. dollars; to prohibit the U.S. from buying heavy water from Iran, a key component for some nuclear reactors; and most recently, to prohibit so-called ransom payments to Iran, which would, in fact, put the U.S. in violation of its international obligations under the Algiers Accords, which have been in effect since 1981, under both Republican and Democratic administrations. The White House has issued a statement of policy making it clear that the President would veto the bill before us today, stating: ``The United States has a long tradition of remaining faithful to our commitments and our international partners, and a reversal of this principle undercuts our credibility, diminishes our ability to lead globally, and threatens the very alliances we rely upon in implementing the JCPOA.'' We know that this bill would violate a key provision of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that specifically committed to the sale of commercial planes to Iran by prohibiting our financial institutions from facilitating those sales. It also would put U.S. aircraft manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage with their foreign competitors, whose access to financing would not be subject to the same constraints. The legislation is also concerning because it would remove the President's national security waiver with regard to restrictions on the Export-Import Bank's ability to finance exports to Iran. While the administration has never exercised this authority, I believe removing the President's discretion and leverage on critical national security matters would be a serious mistake. So I strongly oppose this bill that aims to undo the hard-fought progress to contain Iran's nuclear ambitions and undercuts our ability to exercise global leadership, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, to quote the great American President, Ronald Reagan: ``There you go again.'' Attack the President-elect, and try to throw out red herrings. The bill that we have before us has two simple titles, the Iran Financing Prohibition--and I will read section 101: ``The Secretary of the Treasury may not authorize a transaction by a U.S. financial institution.'' Section 102, Revocation of Prior Authorizations: ``If the Secretary of the Treasury authorized any transaction described under section 101 before the date of the enactment of this title, such authorization is hereby revoked.'' We are halfway through. Section 2, Title II, No Ex-Im Assistance for Terrorism. It simply says that there is a prohibition--on section 202: ``Prohibition on Export-Import Bank Financing that would Benefit Iran.'' That means direct financing. That would be subhead A. Indirect Financing, meaning you can't have a third party get that lending from the Export-Import Bank, by the way, a U.S. taxpayer-funded bank. So that is subhead B. And C is Cancellation of Approved Financing, if they have done that already. This bill is not that complicated, and this bill does not cite any particular company. It does not limit any company from selling aircraft to Iran, no matter how big of a mistake that might be. It simply says--as I might add, Secretary Jack Lew, Secretary of the Treasury, said in April of this year: There will be no U.S. financial institution financing this deal. And we have added that second section, that second title that says: There will be no use of the U.S. taxpayer- financed Export-Import Bank. That is all this bill says. So you have heard attacks on the President-elect. You have heard attacks on the Export-Import Bank and whether this is going to be good or bad for U.S. employers and employees. The simple fact is, Mr. Speaker, that this bill, H.R. 5711, says: We are not going to allow U.S. financial institutions, and U.S. financial institutions only, to be used to finance these deals; and we are not going to allow the Export-Import Bank of the United States to be used, either directly or indirectly, to finance that deal. Iran can go put this deal together with other banks in Asia, Europe, anywhere else in the world that they can find it, but not here in the United States and not using taxpayer dollars. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support [[Page H6263]] H.R. 5711, the No U.S. Financing for Iran Act, introduced by my good friend Bill Huizenga. This bill also includes the outstanding work of my good friend Peter Roskam, who introduced H.R. 5715, the No Ex-Im Assistance for Terrorism Act. Mr. Speaker, President Obama has made an endless stream of concessions to the Iranian government. Most recently, in September, the administration announced that it would issue special export licenses for Boeing and Airbus to sell dozens of commercial aircraft to Iran--a deal that together is valued at upwards of $50 billion. Yet the deal is not finalized because Iran is having difficulty financing it. The No U.S. Financing for Iran Act will guarantee that the U.S. plays no part in facilitating this financing: it blocks the Treasury Department from authorizing U.S. financial institutions from supporting such transactions and prevents the U.S. Export-Import Bank from extending direct or indirect credit to the Government of Iran. Although the Ex-Im Bank is prohibited from providing direct financing to Iran, it could do so through a third-party. For instance, Reuters last week reported that after months of negotiations, Iran secured financing possibly through an Emirati leasing company for the first 17 planes it plans to buy from Airbus. If the U.S. Ex-Im Bank were to provide financing to such a third-party company, it would in effect be facilitating Iran's purchase of the aircraft. It is important to recall why Iran should not be receiving these planes in the first place: until President Obama implemented his nuclear deal, Iran Air had for over four years been subject to U.S. sanctions due to the company's notorious working relationship with Iran's military and Revolutionary Guards Corps. For years, Iran Air has smuggled rockets, missiles, and other sensitive materiel aboard its passenger and cargo planes bound for regional hotspots, such as Syria, home to Iranian terrorist proxies and murderous regimes. The Obama Administration was absolutely wrong to drop these sanctions in connection with the nuclear deal because this support has little or nothing to do with Iran's nuclear program. On the contrary, much of this activity is related to Iran's sponsorship of terrorism--for which the United States still imposes sanctions on Iran. It is long past time for the Administration to stop accommodating this genocidal regime and rather hold it to account. Just last week the IAEA reported that Iran had for the second time this year exceeded its quota for heavy water as stipulated in the nuclear deal. But instead of calling this violation what it is, the Obama Administration chose to sweep it under the rug. Such passivity in the face of Iranian violations only emboldens the regime to see what more it can get away with. This is a dangerous game to play when the consequences are so grave for our national security and that of our close ally Israel. The Administration's nuclear deal with Iran itself contained far too many major concessions: it recognized Iran's right to enrichment, despite longstanding United States policy against such recognition, and settled for a weak inspections regime that is anything but ``anytime, anywhere.'' We must act again today to put a stop to the concessions. For that reason, I urge my colleagues to pass this urgent measure. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate on the bill has expired. Amendment No. 1 Printed in Part A of House Report 114-818 Offered by Mr. Huizenga of Michigan Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 1, before line 1, insert the following: SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``No U.S. Financing for Iran Act''. Page 1, line 7, strike ``that is ordinarily incident to'' and insert ``in connection with''. Page 4, after line 3, insert the following: TITLE III--SUNSET SEC. 301. SUNSET. This Act and the amendment made by this Act shall cease to be effective on the date that is 30 days after the date on which the President certifies to Congress that the Government of Iran has ceased providing support for acts of international terrorism. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 921, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, at this point my amendment adds a short title and clarifies the nature of prohibited Iranian transactions. The amendment also provides for a sunset of the bill's provision upon presidential certification that Iran has ceased support of international terrorism. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this amendment and the underlying bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. HECK of Washington. The key change made by this amendment is to strike the phrase ``ordinarily incident to'' and insert ``in connection with.'' One is a term of art commonly used by the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC. Companies doing business with an OFAC license know what that means. In connection with is a much broader term, not clearly defined, Mr. Speaker, and if this amendment were to pass, exactly how attenuated of a connection would be impermissible? Crickets, because we don't know. I believe the chilling effect of this language would go far beyond the purported intent of this legislation. And let there be no confusion what the intent is, which is to block a single legal, fully compliant, and scandal-free business transaction that supports both our national security and American manufacturing. If this bill became law, we would be less safe. The U.S. specifically committed in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or the Iran Deal, as we refer to it, to allow the sale of commercial aircraft to Iran, as well as the provision of associated services. Associated services is specifically defined in the relevant section of the agreement to include financial services of the kind U.S. banks would be specifically blocked from providing under this bill. Well, it is hard to think of anything that would be a clearer violation of our own commitments under the JCPOA, an action that would give Iran a meaningful reason to walk away from the whole thing, making us less safe. It is a clear, black-and-white violation of the JCPOA. And what is our plan B if Congress provokes the collapse of this agreement? Crickets. We don't have one. Think of how much went into the successful negotiation of the agreement. We had to convince a lot of countries, with whom we don't often always agree, to maintain a united front for U.N. sanctions to be effective. If we choose to burn down the JCPOA, which this will do, entirely of our own volition, are my colleagues under any illusion that we could simply go back to our partners, not to mention Iran, and say with a straight face: Well, let's start over. And why wouldn't Iran just happily revel in the unraveling of the mighty international coalition which brought them to the table and go back to building up its nuclear program again? Again, crickets, because they would be likely to. So let's be clear. Yes, we continue to have numerous and serious differences with Iran. But as we counter their destabilizing behavior in other parts of the Middle East, I know I sleep better at night knowing that the Iran deal prevents them from obtaining a nuclear bomb with which to set off either a regional arms race or threaten our allies with nuclear blackmail. And frankly, if Iran is going to get new planes--and nothing in this bill will stop them, the choice is really not whether it is going to be Boeing or Airbus--I sleep better at night knowing that you have got American eyes on that plane in the form of the after-sale services for parts repair and American hands doing the maintenance to guard against the diversion from legitimate civil aviation use. It keeps us more safe if these are American-made planes. But even if we ignore all the compelling evidence that this bill will make us less safe, this bill fails spectacularly at preventing Iran from buying airplanes. In fact, I am certain it would hurt our own aerospace industry way more than it would hurt Iran. It is easy for foreign companies to get around this bill. They easily go to non-U.S. banks for financing. But American companies don't have that option to cut out U.S. banks entirely, unless you prefer that the proceeds from a sale be kept offshore, that American workers and communities [[Page H6264]] never see a dime of reinvestment, and the more than 100,000 jobs this transaction could support go to other countries. This bill is also an attack on a key pillar of support for our exporters, including the aerospace exporters, namely, the Ex-Im Bank. Despite the fact that the Ex-Im Bank already has a policy against this, despite the fact that there is law against this, despite the fact that the Ex-Im has said they won't do this, and despite the fact that the seller, Boeing, has said in writing they won't do this. This isn't belts and suspenders. This is stapling your pants to your flesh. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this bill that undermines foundational elements of our national and economic security, and, in so doing, I too am reminded of what President Reagan once said: ``It's not what you don't know that bothers me, it's what you think you know that ain't so.'' Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Washington, who has been a big proponent of the Export-Import Bank and a particular company that he was alluding to and talking about, knows, though, that this bill would apply to any aircraft that the Treasury authorizes for Iran. That includes the 17 Airbus planes for Iran Air. And he brought up, actually, offshore profits. Well, according to Bloomberg, Boeing has $800 million--$800 million in profits stashed offshore; and the reports are that Boeing is pursuing these deals with the Japanese bank already, not a U.S. bank. And apparently the company is less worried about this bill and that financing than my friend from Washington is. {time} 1900 So this is simply about saying that Iran does not have direct access to the U.S. financial system. I don't understand why my friends and colleagues on the other side of the aisle are so freaked out by that. This is simply about making sure that our banking system is not going to finance this deal indirectly or directly and that the use of the Export-Import Bank would be prohibited. This amendment says it is a sunset to this bill upon Presidential certification that Iran has ceased support of international terrorism-- a goal we all have. So if the President can support that and certify that, then this falls away. So we do not say that this deal is not allowed. We simply say that U.S. financial institutions cannot be used for this and that we cannot and will not use the Export-Import Bank--a U.S. taxpayer-funded entity--to do this. At the end of the day, in April of this past year, Secretary Jack Lew told us that there will be no access; and either he misled the United States citizens and this body at that time or they changed their mind. They haven't told us which, but neither one is acceptable. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the previous question is ordered on the bill, as amended, and on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga). The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga). The amendment was agreed to. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. Motion to Recommit Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill? Mr. SWALWELL of California. I am opposed in its current form. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: Mr. Swalwell of California moves to recommit the bill H.R. 5711 to the Committee on Financial Services with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith with the following amendment: Page 2, after line 2, insert the following new section: SEC. 103. PROTECTING U.S. ELECTIONS. The Secretary of the Treasury may not authorize a transaction described under section 101 by a U.S. financial institution if such institution is engaged in business with a foreign entity that has been found by the Secretary, in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, to have engaged in or authorized cyber attacks targeting any election held in the United States. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion. Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended. Mr. Speaker, this final amendment says plainly that no U.S. business may do business with a country that has used cyber attacks to undermine a U.S. election. So if my colleagues are genuine in believing that Iran is a hopeless adversary, then surely they will join me in believing that Russia, in its efforts to undermine our recent November election, should also be treated as such. This motion is really about the future of two U.S. adversaries: Iran and Russia. Iran, surely a bad actor over the last few decades, has finally in the last couple of years come to the international table and struck an agreement with the United States and many of our allies to make sure that we take it from being a country that is 3 months away from having a nuclear weapon to 1 year away. They continue to sponsor terrorism across the world. But today, better than ever before, we have eyes, ears, and checks and balances on them that we have never had. By the way, we can address all of their bad behavior with them being much farther away from having a nuclear weapon than they were before the Iran nuclear agreement. Russia, however, continues to wreak chaos in the Middle East supporting Syria and its brutal dictator Assad. Russia brought down a commercial airliner over Ukraine and has further incurred into Ukraine taking over Crimea. Russia continues to attack and escalate hostilities with U.S. personnel at our embassy in Moscow. Now the standard bearer for the Republican Party, President-elect Trump, has chosen to embrace Russia and take the United States on a new tack. So the question today is: If you believe Iran is hopeless, then do you believe that we should also make sure no U.S. business does business with a country that is trying to undermine our elections? I want to go through some of that evidence. On October 7 of this year, Director of National Intelligence Clapper said that the intelligence community is confident that the Russian Government directed cyber attacks aimed at disrupting our November elections. Why would Russia do this? Russia clearly had a favored candidate in this race in President- elect Trump. Russia has been successful. This amendment says that you cannot do business with any country that is trying to influence our elections. This amendment says that if you think Iran is a bad actor, then you have to treat Iran the same way you treat Russia. This amendment says that if you think the U.S. should allow businesses to do business with a country trying to undermine our elections, to undermine the will of our constituents, then you should vote against this amendment. If you are with Russia, then you should be against this motion. However, if you believe that we are closer to preventing Iran from having a nuclear weapon than we were a year ago, and if you believe that it is better for a U.S. manufacturer to provide commercial airliners to Iran and create U.S. jobs and have eyes and ears on what is going on over there, then you should be for this motion. But if you want our elections to be free and fair from outside influence, then vote for this motion. If you want to stand with Russia, then you should vote against this motion. So I ask my colleagues on the other side: Are you going to embrace the new U.S. foreign policy that your standard bearer has proposed, that we are going to undermine and unravel the agreement that we have struck with Iran and march millions of young men and women back into the Middle East, an area where we have not had major combat operations finally for the first time [[Page H6265]] in 15 years? Or do you think that we should treat Iran the same way that we are treating Russia? So I submit that to my colleagues, and I invite them to maybe engage on that question because that is what this motion is about: Do you stand with Russia? Or do you stand with preventing U.S. businesses from doing business with a country that our intelligence community has said has tried to undermine our elections? Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Well, America, you just heard a ridiculous straw-man choice laid out in front of you. Mr. Speaker, this is not about anything other than selling and financing aircraft sales to Iran. That is what this bill is about. This is what this bill should be about. I will point out to my colleague that there are some pretty major kinetic activities--I believe they are called at this point, which means shooting war--happening in Mosul and other places where our troops are involved. But at the end of the day, Mr. Speaker, I want to encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this motion to recommit. I look forward to working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to address concerns that we may have with other foreign governments in the future, and I would request that they vote for the underlying bill, H.R. 5711. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the order of the House of today, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [House] [Pages H6255-H6265] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PROHIBITING THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY FROM AUTHORIZING CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS RELATING TO COMMERCIAL PASSENGER AIRCRAFT TO IRAN Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 921, I call up the bill (H.R. 5711) to prohibit the Secretary of the Treasury from authorizing certain transactions by a U.S. financial institution in connection with the export or re-export of a commercial passenger aircraft to the Islamic Republic of Iran, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 921, in lieu of the amendment recommended by the Committee on Financial Services printed in the bill, an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 114-66 is adopted, and the bill, as amended, is considered read. The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows: H.R. 5711 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, TITLE I--IRAN FINANCING PROHIBITION SECTION 101. PROHIBITION. The Secretary of the Treasury may not authorize a transaction by a U.S. financial institution (as defined under section 561.309 of title 31, Code of Federal Regulations) that is ordinarily incident to the export or re-export of a commercial passenger aircraft to the Islamic Republic of Iran. SEC. 102. REVOCATION OF PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS. If the Secretary of the Treasury authorized any transaction described under section 101 before the date of the enactment of this title, such authorization is hereby revoked. TITLE II--NO EX-IM ASSISTANCE FOR TERRORISM SEC. 201. SHORT TITLE. This title may be cited as the ``No Ex-Im Assistance for Terrorism Act''. [[Page H6256]] SEC. 202. PROHIBITION ON EXPORT-IMPORT BANK FINANCING THAT WOULD BENEFIT IRAN. Section 2(b) of the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 (12 U.S.C. 635(b)) is amended by adding at the end the following: ``(14) Prohibition on Financing That Would Benefit Iran.-- ``(A) Direct financing.--The Bank shall not guarantee, insure, or extend (or participate in an extension of) credit in connection with any transaction with respect to which credit assistance from the Bank is first sought after the effective date of this paragraph by-- ``(i) the Government of Iran or an entity owned or controlled by the Government of Iran; or ``(ii) an entity created under Iranian law, or a foreign subsidiary of such an entity. ``(B) Indirect financing.--The Bank shall not guarantee, insure, or extend (or participate in an extension of) credit in connection with any transaction with respect to which credit assistance from the Bank is first sought after the effective date of this paragraph involving-- ``(i) an entity for the purpose of a transaction involving the Government of Iran or an entity referred to in subparagraph (A); or ``(ii) a non-United States entity that, in the 5-year period ending with the date of the enactment of this paragraph, has leased or sold aircraft to the Government of Iran or an entity referred to in subparagraph (A) in contravention of United States law, or a subsidiary or controlling parent of such a non-United States entity. ``(C) Cancellation of approved financing.--The Bank shall cease the provision of financial assistance approved by the Bank in connection with a transaction with respect to which credit assistance from the Bank is approved after the effective date of this paragraph, on finding that the assistance has facilitated the export, sale, or lease of an aircraft to an entity referred to in subparagraph (A), and shall seek immediate recovery of any amount provided by the Bank in connection with the transaction.''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill shall be debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and the ranking minority member of the Committee on Financial Services. After 1 hour of debate, it shall be in order to consider the further amendment printed in part A of House Report 114-818, if offered by the Member designated in the report, which shall be considered read and shall be separately debatable for the time specified in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent. The gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine Waters) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. General Leave Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to submit extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. When our fellow Americans deposit their earnings in a U.S. bank or entrust the government with their tax dollars, they do so assuming that their money will not be used in ways which undermine the security of our very Nation and, frankly, of the world. The legislation we are debating tonight is a package of bills that is designed to prevent the Obama administration from further undermining the trust of the American people and the security of our Nation, as well as the security of our allies. Under President Obama's nuclear deal with Iran, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or the JCPOA, the administration agreed to authorize the export of civilian aircraft to Iran. What the JCPOA did not include was authorization for the U.S. financing of those sales. As Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said in April in a Council on Foreign Relations speech: ``Iran, complied with the nuclear agreement. Therefore, the nuclear sanctions are lifted. I think that that is a process that is becoming more and more clear. And we'll keep our part of the bargain there. But the U.S. financial system is not open to Iran and that is not something that is going to change.'' Again, that was Secretary Jack Lew in April of this past year. Mr. Speaker, something changed. In September, the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control issued licenses to Airbus and to Boeing that permitted the sale of up to 97 airplanes to Iran Air, the country's flagship, state-owned carrier. These licenses didn't stop there, however. By going beyond the scope of the JCPOA, they also authorized U.S. financial institutions to ``engage in all transactions necessary to provide financing or other financial services'' related to the Iran Air orders. My bill, H.R. 5711, would prohibit the Secretary of the Treasury from authorizing U.S. financing through American banks in connection with the export of commercial aircraft to Iran just as the administration claimed was U.S. policy to begin with. This bill would keep Americans' deposits away from a country that the President's own State Department calls ``the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism'' and which the Treasury has designated as ``a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern.'' Let me repeat that. The State Department, itself, says this is the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism, and the Treasury Department has designated a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern. How many more red flags need to go up? Under this bill, Americans would not have to fear that their savings are being channeled to Iran Air, which was sanctioned by the Treasury in 2011 for ferrying soldiers and weapons of war to Syria--the site of a 5-year conflict that has claimed a half a million lives and has displaced millions more. This is the same Iran Air that a U.N. report concluded had shared ballistic military technology with North Korea and is the same Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps whose deputy commander called for an end to Israel, making note of more than 100,000 missiles that were ready ``for the annihilation--the wiping out--and the collapse of the Zionist regime.'' Additionally, research by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies shows that Iran Air's support of the Assad regime continues to this very day. Why should U.S. banks and their customers be implicated in Iranian atrocities? I would submit that there is no reasonable answer to this, which is why this commonsense prohibition, when offered as an amendment to this year's Financial Services appropriations bill, was passed by this very body--the House of Representatives--by a voice vote. However, this bill goes even further, Mr. Speaker. Not only will H.R. 5711 protect Americans' bank accounts, it will prevent their tax dollars from being used through the Export-Import Bank to subsidize aircraft sales to Iran. It would be through direct transactions or third-party leasing, which is becoming more and more common. This codifies and strengthens an existing Ex-Im prohibition that is renewed in annual appropriations bills. For that reason, this measure enjoyed the support of Ex-Im supporters and critics alike when it came before the Financial Services Committee. H.R. 5711 combines the text of two bills that were reported by the Committee on Financial Services; one of them sponsored by me and the other by Congressman Roskam of Illinois. Both pieces of legislation were cosponsored by our Democrat colleague, Congressman Sherman of California, who has devoted years to Iran policy, both as a member of the Financial Services Committee and of the Foreign Affairs Committee. I thank Representative Sherman and Representative Roskam for working with me on this very important legislation package; and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this important bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am disappointed that we are here, yet again, debating another Republican bill to undermine the Iran nuclear deal--a deal that, so far, has delivered on its principal goal of blocking Iran's path to nuclear weapons for the foreseeable future. This is a dangerous move that, if enacted, would put U.S. and global security at risk. Specifically, H.R. 5711 would prohibit the Treasury Secretary from authorizing any transaction by a U.S. financial institution to support the export of commercial planes to Iran. Doing so would violate a key component of the agreement in which the U.S. has committed to allowing the sales of these planes and the associated financial [[Page H6257]] services that are necessary to support the sales. Earlier this year, the Treasury Department issued a license to Boeing for the sale of 80 passenger planes to Iran--valued at $17.6 billion-- and authorized U.S. financial institutions to engage in all transactions necessary to allow Boeing to receive payment for the sale. This legislation not only puts the Boeing deal in the crosshairs by prohibiting it from conducting a lawful sale under the agreement, but it also places the viability of the nuclear deal itself in question. Moreover, this legislation would breach the good faith provision in the agreement by which all parties agreed not to undermine its successful implementation. H.R. 5711 also includes language that prevents the Export-Import Bank from financing exports to Iran, which is a red herring because the Ex- Im Bank has not supported exports to Iran since the 1970s, and it is legally prohibited from doing so as long as Iran is a state sponsor of terror. Notably, the bill removes the President's national security waiver with regard to these restrictions--a move that denies the President the flexibility that is necessary to work with our allies to find the most effective ways of changing Iran's behavior. The fact is that all previous Iran sanctions bills that have passed the House and that have become law have included a Presidential waiver that gives the President the flexibility to act quickly and maneuver when doing so serves the U.S. national security interest. Mr. Speaker, I am particularly concerned that this bill comes at a time of deep global uncertainty about U.S. foreign policy. We have a President-elect whose talk on foreign policy has ranged from vague and contradictory in some areas to utterly incoherent elsewhere. He has inserted unpredictability into the international arena, has questioned the value of U.S. alliances, and has threatened the cornerstones of decades of American foreign policy leadership. Yet, instead of reassuring the world that the United States is committed to working with our global allies to promote our collective security, House Republicans have decided to push yet another piece of legislation through the House to destabilize the agreement that is central to preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. {time} 1800 I do wonder why their leadership decided to bring this bill to the floor now in the lameduck session when they know the President will veto it. Perhaps my colleagues on the other side of the aisle know that in two short months, they will no longer have the luxury of legislating without consequences. Come January, we will have a President who has called the Iran nuclear agreement the worst deal ever negotiated. Like most of his other nonsense policies, Mr. Trump has claimed he will either more strictly enforce the agreement or negotiate ``a much better deal'' or dismantle it altogether. We don't know, and he doesn't know. So I am going to bet that, under the Trump administration, Republicans will not be so eager to move legislation to unravel this agreement because, like the rest of us, they do not know how Mr. Trump will govern and because they know there is no other reasonable approach to curbing Iran's nuclear ambition, short of military intervention. I, therefore, urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this bill and sending a strong message to the President-elect and our allies around the world that Democrats remain committed to a strong U.S. engagement in the world and will not tolerate any attempt to undermine the Iran nuclear deal or any other international arrangements that keep us safe. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Roskam), a leader on this issue who is the author of H.R. 5715. Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga) and also Chairman Hensarling for their consistent and persistent work on this issue. My friend from California mentioned a minute ago her disappointment. Well, if you want to talk about disappointment and destabilizing of the deal, just look at what the Iranians have done since the JCPOA passed. By the way, a majority of the House of Representatives and a majority of the United States Senate, not on a partisan basis either, Mr. Speaker, voted against the JCPOA. So let's put that in context. But the President insisted, he moved along, and here we are. So let's see what we can do about it. Before we fix it, let's look at what the Iranians have done. They are the destabilizers. There have been Iranian-supplied rockets launched at a U.S. Naval ship. Iran has fired rockets within 1,500 feet in December of last year on U.S. ships numerous times. The IRGC patrol boats have aggressively harassed U.S. ships in the Strait of Hormuz. Iran has launched numerous ballistic missile tests in violation of the U.N. Security Council resolutions. They violated the JCPOA by producing excess heavy water. They continue to kidnap Americans and hold them for ransom. So let's put it where it lies. The destabilizing impact doesn't belong with the United States. It doesn't belong with any statement by an American policyholder. The destabilizing nature belongs, Mr. Speaker, to the Iranian regime, the mullahs themselves. So the gentlewoman from California said she is disappointed. Well, look, I mean, disappointment, get used to it. It is the nature of things. The nature of the disappointment is that we now have American companies that are saying: You know what? Let's go in and let's do business with a terrorist regime. How is that? Let's just go make a buck. That is the scandal of this. The scandal is that there are American companies, there are international companies--Boeing, Airbus--that are now making their own names inextricably linked with terror forever more. That is the scandal. So what are we trying to do? The gentlewoman said that the Ex-Im elements of this--I think she said--was a red herring. If not, it was words to that effect. No, it is not so. Because if you look carefully at what the Ex-Im prohibition actually prohibits, Mr. Speaker, it prohibits the direct financing to the Iranian regime. Fine, if that is all this did, well and good. There is no reason to oppose it, then. Of course, that is not where the Ex-Im is actually limited. Because here is what can happen: under current law, the Ex-Im Bank can do a deal with the Europeans, for example. What can happen, then? That can be leased under current law to the Iranians. This amendment, Mr. Huizenga's language, would prohibit that. That is what we are trying to do. Look, think about the irony of this. You have got an administration that currently is telling Americans it is a dangerous thing to go to Iran; that you are at risk of being kidnapped if you go to Iran. At the same time--picture this, Mr. Speaker--that that is being articulated, they are also saying: We are going to help you do some business over there. That is ridiculous. It is absurd, it is contradictory, and it is indefensible. So here is the good news: The good news is we can do something about it. The other good news is this Iran deal has a very short shelf life because the President-elect has said he doesn't like it. President Obama didn't do the hard work of developing a national consensus on it. If he had, it would have been a treaty and a treaty that would have bound the United States in permanency; but he didn't do that. Why? Because it was a bad idea and he couldn't sell it to Congress. So he went the easy way, did it basically by executive order. And what goes around comes around. So we can do some good work here today. We can move this out. Is President Obama going to sign it? Obviously not, but that is not to say that it is not what we should do. We know what we need to do. We need to make sure that the American financial system is not complicit in this deal. We need to make sure that American taxpayers are not subsidizing this deal. I urge the bill's passage. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Himes), a member of the Financial Services Committee and the House [[Page H6258]] Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, with all due respect to the gentleman from Michigan, once again, we find ourselves in this dreary and dangerous ritual of considering a bill which, without question, would cause us to violate our agreement under the JCPOA. We get the same arguments about how bad the Iranian regime is, and we get the same misstatements like: This is President Obama's deal. It is not President Obama's deal. It is a deal of the United Nations Security Council, of China, of Russia, of Great Britain, of France, of Germany, the U.K., and the rest of the world who combined working for a period of almost 15 years hammered out a deal--and I say this as a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence--which today has removed Iran as a nuclear threat. Yet, here again, we are offered a bill that would compromise our obligations and almost certainly result in centrifuges spinning once again in Tehran and then leading on to the very likely prospect of yet another Middle Eastern war. Yes, Iran is a sponsor of terrorism. Yes, it is a bad place. You will get no argument from this side of the aisle that this is a bad regime. Once again, I remind my Republican friends that their patron saint, Ronald Reagan, made a nuclear deal with the Soviet Union, also a sponsor of terrorism, an appalling regime; but Ronald Reagan was smart enough to know that you can make a deal that makes everybody safer even with some very bad people. Ronald Reagan. One thing I know as a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence is that what used to be a mortal national security threat to the United States--2 to 3 months from breakout time, 2 to 3 months over which would almost certainly be involved in yet another war in the Middle East--has been taken off the table. Now, the Republicans not only seek to scuttle that deal with all of the implications, but they do it by stopping an American company from selling a flagship American product around the world. If you use the Department of Commerce's multiplier, the bill they are pushing today would result in 100,000 American jobs not created so that they can continue with this fetish of eliminating a deal, which has made us safer. If there is any question about whether this has made us safer, let me again quote General Gadi Eizenkot, who is the chief of staff of the Israeli Defense Forces. He said the deal has actually removed the most serious danger to Israel's existence for the foreseeable future and greatly reduced the threat over the longer term. That is the chief of staff of the Israeli Defense Forces, but my friends in the Republican Party know better about what is good for Israel. These sad charades end pretty soon because the bluff has been called. President Trump has said he will tear up the Iran deal. When he does that--because this, of course, is not becoming law--the centrifuges will spin again. To my friends on the other side of the aisle, when the centrifuges are spinning, we and I will stand here and we will tell the American people why centrifuges are spinning again. And where we were 2 years ago when we thought we were going to war with Iran, if we go to Iran, when Israeli planes are bombing Iran, we will stand here and explain why we are now in another Middle Eastern war. We can avoid that by ending these charades and finally accepting this deal. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot), who is the chairman of the Small Business Committee, but also a previous chair of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5711. I want to the commend my colleagues, Congressmen Huizenga and Sherman, for authoring this bipartisan piece of legislation. It was once said that the West would sell its enemies the rope that would be used to hang itself with. Well, because of the disastrously flawed Iran deal, that is exactly what we are currently doing. That is why this legislation is so important. H.R. 5711 essentially prevents the export or reexport of commercial passenger aircraft to the Islamic Republic of Iran. This bill would cut off Iran's means of delivering weapons to terrorist organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah, and to Syrian dictator Bashir al-Assad, a war criminal who is responsible for the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War. The truth is we wouldn't even need to be here today if the Obama administration had just paid attention to the facts on the ground in the Middle East. When negotiating the disastrous Iran nuclear deal, despite knowing Iran was the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, President Obama and Secretary Kerry permitted the sale of commercial aircraft to Iran anyway. Incredibly, under current U.S. law, if we issued a license for Iran Air to purchase aircraft from an American manufacturer and then Iran walked away from its commitment, U.S. taxpayers would have to foot the bill for Iran. In this case, that could be up to $70 billion on the U.S. taxpayer. Given Iran Air's multiple unpaid commitments over the years, that outrageous outcome is entirely possible. So for all of the reasons that I have mentioned and for reasons that have been stated already by my colleagues, I would urge clear-minded people on both sides of the aisle to support this legislation. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Price), a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee. Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 5711. This legislation is only the latest misguided and politicized effort by the majority to undermine the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, a historic agreement negotiated by the world's major powers in order to keep Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. Simply put, enactment of H.R. 5711 would violate the United States Government's obligations under the JCPOA, opening the door for Iran to walk away from this agreement. It also threatens to undermine our credibility with our allies and negotiating partners. Now, we must be vigilant. No one disagrees that we must be vigilant in ensuring Iranian compliance with the terms of the JCPOA. We also should continue to hold Iran to account for its violations of human rights, for its sponsorship of terrorism, and for its nonnuclear weapons development. Last night, I supported, as did almost every Member of this body, a clean reauthorization of the Iran Sanctions Extension Act, which guarantees Congress' ability to snap back sanctions should Iran violate the JCPOA. The reauthorization also allows Congress to take positive action on transition day should it be verified that Iran has used its nuclear capacity only for peaceful purposes. So the continued authorization of sanctions will allow the United States to continue to exert pressure on the Iranian regime. The dangerous bill before us today will do just exactly the opposite. By directly blocking a specific provision of the JCPOA--namely, the permissible sale of commercial passenger aircraft--this legislation would send a clear message to the Iranian people that the United States does not negotiate in good faith; that we expect to have it both ways, with Iran dismantling its nuclear facilities and getting nothing in return. {time} 1815 We must also remember, my colleagues, that the Iran nuclear agreement is not just a bilateral agreement between Iran and the United States. It is the product of years and years of negotiations between Iran and the P5+1, which is the United Kingdom, China, France, Russia, Germany, and the United States. The bill before us today would break faith with those negotiating partners in a reckless and dangerous way. Because of this agreement, the breakout time for Iran to develop enough weapons-grade material for a nuclear weapon went from 2 to 3 months to a year or more. Because of this agreement, the international community has 24/7 access to Iran's nuclear sites. Because of this agreement, we possess the enforcement mechanisms necessary to verify Iran's compliance. [[Page H6259]] By all objective accounts, Iran has upheld its end of the bargain. Why would we give up these capabilities by failing to uphold ours? In light of the political transitions taking place in our country, now is especially the time when the United States must keep its word, its word to our allies and to the international community. Now, regardless of all this, it appears that our Republican colleagues are willing to jeopardize a major international agreement for political advantage. They are willing to undermine the credibility of the United States and our allies on the international stage. My colleagues, instead of scoring political points or seeking to undo the foreign policy legacy of the outgoing President, we should be working together in a bipartisan manner to ensure this agreement's success. For that reason, I urge colleagues to vote against this bill. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), a member of the House Committee on Financial Services. Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5711. Despite the President's assurances, Iran remains a menace to the stability of the Middle East and a threat to America and its allies. All of us, both Republicans and Democrats, need to take action to reduce the harm that this rogue state and its accomplices can do. H.R. 5711 takes some very important steps in that effort. By prohibiting the Secretary of the Treasury from green-lighting U.S. financing for the export of commercial aircraft to Iran, we are making it more difficult for Iranian airlines to acquire planes that we know are used to ferry soldiers and weapons. I need to ask my colleagues across the aisle: Is that such a bad idea? By blocking Ex-Im assistance to the Government of Iran, we are preventing the U.S. taxpayer from subsidizing efforts by the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism to acquire aircraft to support its deadly activities around the world. We can all agree that Ex-Im should never be used for this purpose. The Government of Iran continues to fund terrorist activities, and it is intimately involved in Syria's violent civil war. Let us not forget the recent hostile actions taken by Houthi rebels in Yemen. These rebels receive funds from Iran, and they fired missiles at U.S. Navy warships on patrol in the Red Sea. The American people cannot be complicit in these hostilities. We owe it to our constituents and our allies around the world to pass this commonsense legislation. I thank my colleagues from Michigan, Illinois, and California for introducing this bill. I urge its support. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett), a member of the Committee on Ways and Means. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, will this Congress ground Boeing or support this key manufacturer and the jobs that it creates, that have already helped make America great? Will we march to the tune of the pied pipers against peace who see war with Iran as the only way to restrain it from developing nuclear weapons? Part of what makes trade so important to us is that countries that trade together are less likely to go to war with one another. The House today is being asked to vote to block the sale of about 80 Boeing aircraft to update an aging and unsafe commercial airline in Iran. If this bill passes, that is bad news for a major American business, and it is also bad news to thousands of skilled workers across this country who won't see any part of what could be a $25 billion deal. It is great news for Boeing's major European competitor to get the work that these supporters would deny to Boeing. This is, of course, just the latest of one effort after another to undermine the only way forward, short of war, to limit Iran's ability to develop nuclear weapons. This realization is why this very week so many national security experts have urged Mr. Trump to reconsider, to reverse his threat to break the promises that our country made in an international agreement. This week also, the European Union affirmed its support for that international agreement. The six other countries that joined us in that international agreement are honoring their promises, and we should do the same thing. What will keep Boeing from flying high? It is the war hawks that fly high, so insistent on undermining this important pact that has made our family safer. If the hawks win, it is about more than losing a multibillion-dollar deal to one American manufacturer. It really means that nothing--nothing--but the threat of another American war, an American attack, will hold Iran back from developing nuclear weapons. This is about more than destabilizing the American workforce. Undermining this agreement will destabilize the Middle East. It will jeopardize our families and the families of our allies. Once again, this measure should be rejected. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Pittenger), a member of the Committee on Financial Services. Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to voice my support for H.R. 5711 and to thank Congressman Huizenga for his leadership on this very important issue. This bill prohibits the Secretary of the Treasury from authorizing certain transactions by U.S. financial institutions in connection with the export or reexport of a commercial passenger aircraft to the Islamic Republic of Iran. As the primary sponsor of terrorism throughout the world, it is imperative that we hold Iran accountable and do all we can to limit their abilities to promote this type of action and behavior. This bill confronts the same airline that has been sanctioned by the Treasury Department for transporting fighters and weapons on behalf of Iran's Revolutionary Guard. It is beyond me how the administration can be okay with allowing Iran access to airplanes which would only further their support of terrorism. I supported this commonsense legislation when it was marked up in the Committee on Financial Services, and I am proud to support it today. Thank you to my good friend, Congressman Huizenga, for sponsoring this legislation. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations on the Committee on the Judiciary. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California, Ranking Member Waters, for the leadership that she gave this issue in the Committee on Financial Services, and I rise today to offer my opposition to this bill for a number of reasons. I will say that it is interesting--I heard my colleague from North Carolina mention the Soviet Union and the interests and the efforts that President Reagan made to, in fact, make America safer in his time and in his context. Interestingly, in the backdrop of today, one could now argue that Russia has, in its portfolio, advocacy for terrorists as well as a large profile of cyberterrorism and hacking into the United States as well as a blatant interference in the most recent Presidential election. As I look to my colleagues speaking about what the President-elect will do, I would hope that he would not undermine the national security of this Nation. First of all, we know that this bill will be vetoed if it gets to the desk of President Obama. This bill would damage a hard-fought diplomatic solution that makes the world safer from nuclear war. The sanctions are working, including extensive monitoring of the nuclear capability of Iran. We also, in a bipartisan manner, supported the potential extinction of Iran sanctions yesterday, and that was the right thing to do, the opportunity or the possibility of doing that. But this bill, in particular, flies in the face of a realistic approach to how we do international engagement. The JCPOA has significantly constrained Iran's nuclear program. Key aspects of the program are dismantled under the JCPOA, and it subjects Iran's nuclear program to unprecedented verification and monitoring requirements. It is working. It is profoundly in the national security interests of the United States to continue to meet our commitments [[Page H6260]] under the JCPOA as long as Iran continues to meet its commitments. Our allies are depending on us. The word of the United States should mean something. We even know that Israel has seen a positive impact, some of its military persons have indicated, by way of the JCPOA. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman. Ms. JACKSON LEE. This bill prohibits the involvement of U.S. financial institutions in the sale of commercial passenger aircraft to Iran Air, civil end use that would put U.S. aircraft manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage with their foreign competitors whose access to financing would not be subject to the same constraints. This is not putting commercialism or jobs above national security. It is, in fact, allowing civil end use to continue as we are standing for our national security. The sweeping and vague nature of this provision would have a chilling effect on U.S. and non-U.S. entities seeking to engage in permissible business with Iran. The United States has a long tradition of remaining faithful to our commitments with our international partners, and a reversal of this principle undercuts our credibility, diminishes our ability to lead globally, and threatens the very alliances we rely upon in implementing the JCPOA. We can anticipate that should this bill become law, our closest allies would view this bill as a violation of the JCPOA commitments, and Iran would take the issue to the Joint Commission. The main thing of this bill is that it will douse the friendship and alliance that we are making with allies who want a peaceful nonproliferation of nuclear activity. This is a ``no'' vote in order to provide for the national security of this Nation. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Schweikert), a member of the House Committee on Financial Services. Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Huizenga for the couple minutes. This is one of those moments, has anyone actually read the four pages on the bill? Great. In that case, we should all know this isn't about selling jets. It is about using the American financial system to finance them. That is what the language of the bill is. Think about this. We have now spent the last 6 years around this body talking over and over and over how we are going to keep the American financial system safe, how we are going to not do things that concentrate debt within our capital markets. If Iran wants to buy jets, let them go find bilateral agreements in other countries. Let them show up with the cash. Let them go find someone else to put up the surety bonds. Let someone else go put up the coverage on the lost pieces on the ladder of the financing. This piece of legislation coming through the Committee on Financial Services is about protecting our financial system, first, from what many of us on the committee believe is going to turn into bad debt and functionally become toxic within our financial markets; but then, secondly, do you really want the United States financial system providing liquidity and financing for the leading state sponsor of terrorism in the world? That is a pretty powerful ethical question when you consider what we have been through in cleaning up our own financial system over the last few years. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am sorry that Mr. Pittenger left because I really did want to share this point with him. It is important to note that nothing in this legislation will keep new passenger aircraft out of the hands of Iran. The bill only prevents Boeing from selling civilian passenger aircraft to Iran, while foreign aircraft manufacturers, such as Airbus, will still be able to sell their passenger planes to Iran since they won't need U.S. financial institutions to help finance their deals. {time} 1830 What is this? Is this some kind of payback to Boeing? Is this some kind of---- Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Will the gentlewoman yield? Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I yield to the gentleman from Michigan. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. That is actually not true. Airbus is subject to this as well because of the significant number of parts and material in the jets that they produce. So they would be subject to this as well as Boeing. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Reclaiming my time, there is nothing in this legislation that will keep new passenger aircraft out of the hands of Iran. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Williams), who is also a member of the House Financial Services Committee. Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Huizenga for his leadership. Mr. Speaker, the Obama administration's State Department recognizes the Islamic Republic of Iran as one of three state sponsors of terrorism. But, ironically, the President calls his deal with Iran a foreign policy achievement. Our Commander in Chief is proud of his plan that puts Iran on the path to getting a nuclear weapon. He is proud of his plan that condones and facilitates U.S. business with Iran. In September, the Treasury Department authorized the sale of up to 97 Airbus and Boeing planes to Iran. Iran is more than just a labeled state sponsor of terrorism. Iran uses its financial sector for international money laundering. Iran has been a long-time supporter of the brutal Assad regime in Syria. It has supported a government that has killed hundreds of thousands of its own people. Iran's leader has pledged to wipe America and Israel off the map, but none of these facts matter to the Obama administration. They will do whatever they can just to make a deal and ensure a legacy. Mr. Speaker, why are we rewarding and aiding a nation that has contributed to so much disorder and destruction in the Middle East? To me, it is simply a no-brainer. We must not authorize U.S. aircraft sales to Iran. I urge my colleagues to pass H.R. 5711, which would prohibit the Treasury Secretary from authorizing U.S. financing in connection with commercial passenger aircraft to Iran. In God we trust. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I would like to share a portion of a letter from J Street: J Street Calls on Members of Congress to Oppose Anti-JCPOA Bill Restricting Commercial Aircraft Sales. The last paragraph says: ``Additionally, the bill would not even achieve its intended objective of preventing Iran from acquiring commercial aircraft--it would merely ensure that Iran purchases them from a foreign producer, pointlessly denying jobs and income to working Americans and communities across the country. Like so many of the legislative attempts by JCPOA opponents to undermine or kill the agreement, this bill is just another cynical messaging exercise that hurts rather than helps America's essential interests, security, and standing in the world. ``J Street therefore urges Members of Congress to oppose H.R. 5711 and reaffirm the United States' commitment to uphold its international obligations.'' Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Poliquin), a distinguished member of the House Financial Services Committee. Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Huizenga and also Chairman Hensarling for bringing this very important issue before the American people. Mr. Speaker, it is a horrible idea to allow the United States Government to help the Iranian Government support terrorism. This bill helps make sure that does not happen. Now, the world knows that the Iranian Government has a very long history of using their state-owned Iran Air to transport weapons and military personnel for the Revolutionary Guard, which, in turn, trains, arms, and funds [[Page H6261]] terrorist organizations around the world. The Revolutionary Guard and the Government of Iran has American blood on its hands. It should be very concerning to everybody in this Chamber, Republicans and Democrat, that the Iranian leaders for years have chanted, Death to America, and have vowed to wipe the State of Israel off the map. The Iranian Government cannot be trusted. Now, the United States financial institutions should not be allowed to help the Iranian Government purchase aircraft and other equipment proven to be used for military purposes. Mr. Speaker, this bill, H.R. 5711, is a good, commonsense bill. I implore everybody in this Chamber, Republicans and Democrats, to do what is right and to stand up and vote ``yes'' for H.R. 5711 to make sure we do not assist the chief sponsor of terrorism in this world to conduct its activities. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I like Mr. Poliquin. He is a nice man. He always has a nice smile. But I don't trust him more than I trust J Street. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I would like to inquire as to the balance of the time remaining on both sides. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Knight). The gentleman from Michigan has 10\1/2\ minutes remaining. The gentlewoman from California has 10\1/4\ minutes remaining. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill), who is a member of the Financial Services Committee and a former Treasury official. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Michigan for yielding. I rise in strong support of H.R. 5711. And I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman), who serves on our committee, for his leadership on this measure and consistently works on matters concerning Iran, as well as Mr. Roskam of Illinois. I was proud to be a member this past Congress on the Financial Services Committee Task Force to Investigate Terrorism Financing. During our hearings, Mr. Speaker, we heard numerous witnesses describe Iran's support for terrorism and other evil activities. It is really staggering, Mr. Speaker, that we sit here tonight and we have a Member of the other party suggest that Iran is a friend to the United States. There is no friendship between Iran and the United States or our allies. I think that is a stunning thing to say on the House floor. You have heard tonight about Iran's direct involvement in conflicts in Iraq, Syria, Yemen; their support of Hamas, Hezbollah. And one of the main methods they use to support their terrorist activities around the world is they are flying commercial aircraft by the Quds Force around this world supporting terrorism, supplying Assad in Syria, who is responsible for the deaths of hundreds. This deal is not about blocking airplane sales, Mr. Speaker. This deal is about protecting taxpayers on financing airplane sales, protecting our banks in the financing of airplane sales. In fact, Mr. Speaker, the Obama administration has already provided the Government of Iran, the mullahs in Iran over $100 billion in freed-up cash and has given them $1.7 billion in Euros in cash on pallets. Let them use that to buy an aircraft. Let's assume they cost $100 million, $150 million. They can buy several aircraft and pay cash, thanks to the failed diplomacy of the Obama administration. So, again, this legislation is about the belief that the United States should not directly support terrorism and the killing of innocent civilians. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I support this bill. It is the mission of Iran to use these aircraft for nefarious purposes. We already have that guilt on our hands by the release of $100 billion and $1.7 billion in cash. Let's not compound the errors of the past by opposing this bill, which will limit taxpayer risk and our financial sector risk at financing aircraft to Iran. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the balance of my time? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan has 8 minutes remaining. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Dold), a distinguished Member, friend, and former member of the House Financial Services Committee. Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend from Michigan for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I just find it fascinating that here we are again. Listen, we can talk about the JCPOA, this Iran nuclear deal, which I think is a historic mistake, which will haunt us for generations. There is no question about that. If anybody was unclear about where I stand or where I think many in this body stand, let me just simply say that I think this will be a historic mistake that will haunt us. Ultimately, when we are talking about the world's greatest state sponsor of terrorism, what is amazing to me is the fact that this is not even up for debate in the administration. The administration will tell you: Yes, Iran is the world's greatest state sponsor of terror. And you know what? With this agreement, if our destination was to say, You know what, we want to ensure that Iran is never able to get a nuclear weapon, this deal all but ensures it. Bob Menendez, a Democrat over in the Senate, said those very words. Prime Minister Netanyahu says this is a historic mistake. So, yes, we can talk about some of the others over there who believe this is a good thing, but ultimately we realize this is a bad thing. This is a bad thing because, frankly, as we talk about quoting J Street on the floor, I personally want to say that I will trust Bruce Poliquin from Maine, my colleague on the Financial Services Committee. When it comes to a financing bill, yes, I trust Bruce Poliquin a heck of a lot more than I trust J Street. J Street, frankly, is in the tank for the other side. They are not an objective body, I believe. Ultimately, as we look at this bill, Mr. Speaker, this bill doesn't prevent the sale of aircraft. As much as I would like to prevent the sale of aircraft to the world's greatest state sponsor of terror, which could use the aircraft to send supplies and soldiers--because we know that Iran is sending money and supplies to Hezbollah, Hamas, to Assad in Syria. Frankly, this administration will tell you the same thing. This is a bill that prevents the financing. Ultimately, as we look at, how do we protect taxpayer dollars, how do we protect the deposits of millions of Americans that go to Main Street and deposit in their local banks? We are just saying, you can't use financing to go finance the planes that are going over into Iran, the world's greatest state sponsor of terror. If they want to pay cash, it would be one thing to say, You know what? I don't think you have got any cash. Wait, we know they have got cash. Why? Because we just sent an unmarked plane with unmarked bills full of cash, ultimately, we know, for the release of hostages. We have got $1.7 billion that we know is there. We have got $100 billion worth of sanctions relief. You know what, I am counting on the fact that they have got the resources to spend. So what this is doing is this is trying to protect the American taxpayer. Ultimately, what we do know, the administration agrees to authorize the export of civilian aircraft to Iran. That still can happen. This bill does not change that one iota. What it does do is it says that you cannot use U.S. financing for those sales. Ultimately, I think that is a good thing because when we look and we want to go back and they want to talk about it, this is something about the JCPOA, the Iran deal. What is interesting to me, Mr. Speaker, is that the only thing that was bipartisan in the Iran deal was its opposition in this body to that deal. Frankly, I think we ought to be doing everything in our power to make sure that we keep and hold Iran accountable, and we should not be financing planes that go in there because, ultimately, we know they have already [[Page H6262]] fired missiles. Right? They have already broken their agreements. They have fired missiles. They have fired weapons over at U.S. ships. They have captured U.S. sailors. They are taking hostages. This is not a good actor. Frankly, we should be doing everything in our power to make sure that we are holding them accountable and ratcheting up sanctions. We should not make it easier for them to be able to purchase planes. Frankly, we have got all manufacturers that are out there that have parts in the United States that would be implicated with this. So this is not singling out a single U.S. carrier. We want to talk about pro-growth, but what we don't want to do is talk about pro-growth opportunities that are going to help the world's greatest state sponsor of terror. This is a mistake if we do not pass this piece of legislation. I am confident that this bipartisan piece of legislation is going to be able to pass this House. My hope is that the Senate will take it up. I don't believe that the President will sign it--and I think that will be a mistake--but that should not prevent this body from doing the right thing. So, Mr. Speaker, I am going to go right back to where we started at the beginning. The world's greatest state sponsor of terror should not be aided by the U.S. taxpayer, by our banking system, in order to finance planes that we really don't know what they are going to do with them. But what we do know is that Iran is a bad actor and they are going to continue to be the world's greatest state sponsor of terror. So I am going to urge my colleagues to support this bill. It is a commonsense piece of bipartisan legislation. I want to thank the chairman for his work on it, and I want to thank Chairman Hensarling as well. I want to thank Mr. Roskam, and I want to thank everybody here who is going to stand up united to say, this is going to something that we need to hold Iran accountable to. {time} 1845 Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I am prepared to close. I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I was surprised to hear the gentleman from Illinois just repeating some of the outrageous statements that Mr. Trump made during the campaign where he talked about the airplane carrying billions of dollars to Iran. I guess we are going to be hearing a lot of that around here. Mr. Speaker, next year, President-elect Trump will face a daunting array of international challenges. The most pressing of these will be curbing Islamic terrorism, reining in Russian corruption and hegemony, and dealing with the civil wars in Iraq and Syria. The self-proclaimed Islamic State, though it is in retreat in Iraq and Syria, has demonstrated its ability to operate beyond the confines of the Middle East and sponsor attacks in Asia, Europe, and the United States. Moreover, the nuclear threat posed by North Korea will require an immediate and coherent policy response from the Trump administration. So if ever there was a time when the U.S. should be affirming our commitment to the international agreements that promote our stability and security in such a volatile global environment, the time is now. We should be working to reassure our allies and the rest of the world that the U.S. is committed to internationalism and to shaping and preserving the world economic and political order. Yet, Republicans are intent on playing politics and continuing their futile attempts to undermine the Iran nuclear agreement and put the global community at risk of a nuclear Iran. Over the past few months, this House passed Republican bills to reinstate a program denying Iranian financial institutions access to U.S. dollars; to prohibit the U.S. from buying heavy water from Iran, a key component for some nuclear reactors; and most recently, to prohibit so-called ransom payments to Iran, which would, in fact, put the U.S. in violation of its international obligations under the Algiers Accords, which have been in effect since 1981, under both Republican and Democratic administrations. The White House has issued a statement of policy making it clear that the President would veto the bill before us today, stating: ``The United States has a long tradition of remaining faithful to our commitments and our international partners, and a reversal of this principle undercuts our credibility, diminishes our ability to lead globally, and threatens the very alliances we rely upon in implementing the JCPOA.'' We know that this bill would violate a key provision of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that specifically committed to the sale of commercial planes to Iran by prohibiting our financial institutions from facilitating those sales. It also would put U.S. aircraft manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage with their foreign competitors, whose access to financing would not be subject to the same constraints. The legislation is also concerning because it would remove the President's national security waiver with regard to restrictions on the Export-Import Bank's ability to finance exports to Iran. While the administration has never exercised this authority, I believe removing the President's discretion and leverage on critical national security matters would be a serious mistake. So I strongly oppose this bill that aims to undo the hard-fought progress to contain Iran's nuclear ambitions and undercuts our ability to exercise global leadership, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, to quote the great American President, Ronald Reagan: ``There you go again.'' Attack the President-elect, and try to throw out red herrings. The bill that we have before us has two simple titles, the Iran Financing Prohibition--and I will read section 101: ``The Secretary of the Treasury may not authorize a transaction by a U.S. financial institution.'' Section 102, Revocation of Prior Authorizations: ``If the Secretary of the Treasury authorized any transaction described under section 101 before the date of the enactment of this title, such authorization is hereby revoked.'' We are halfway through. Section 2, Title II, No Ex-Im Assistance for Terrorism. It simply says that there is a prohibition--on section 202: ``Prohibition on Export-Import Bank Financing that would Benefit Iran.'' That means direct financing. That would be subhead A. Indirect Financing, meaning you can't have a third party get that lending from the Export-Import Bank, by the way, a U.S. taxpayer-funded bank. So that is subhead B. And C is Cancellation of Approved Financing, if they have done that already. This bill is not that complicated, and this bill does not cite any particular company. It does not limit any company from selling aircraft to Iran, no matter how big of a mistake that might be. It simply says--as I might add, Secretary Jack Lew, Secretary of the Treasury, said in April of this year: There will be no U.S. financial institution financing this deal. And we have added that second section, that second title that says: There will be no use of the U.S. taxpayer- financed Export-Import Bank. That is all this bill says. So you have heard attacks on the President-elect. You have heard attacks on the Export-Import Bank and whether this is going to be good or bad for U.S. employers and employees. The simple fact is, Mr. Speaker, that this bill, H.R. 5711, says: We are not going to allow U.S. financial institutions, and U.S. financial institutions only, to be used to finance these deals; and we are not going to allow the Export-Import Bank of the United States to be used, either directly or indirectly, to finance that deal. Iran can go put this deal together with other banks in Asia, Europe, anywhere else in the world that they can find it, but not here in the United States and not using taxpayer dollars. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support [[Page H6263]] H.R. 5711, the No U.S. Financing for Iran Act, introduced by my good friend Bill Huizenga. This bill also includes the outstanding work of my good friend Peter Roskam, who introduced H.R. 5715, the No Ex-Im Assistance for Terrorism Act. Mr. Speaker, President Obama has made an endless stream of concessions to the Iranian government. Most recently, in September, the administration announced that it would issue special export licenses for Boeing and Airbus to sell dozens of commercial aircraft to Iran--a deal that together is valued at upwards of $50 billion. Yet the deal is not finalized because Iran is having difficulty financing it. The No U.S. Financing for Iran Act will guarantee that the U.S. plays no part in facilitating this financing: it blocks the Treasury Department from authorizing U.S. financial institutions from supporting such transactions and prevents the U.S. Export-Import Bank from extending direct or indirect credit to the Government of Iran. Although the Ex-Im Bank is prohibited from providing direct financing to Iran, it could do so through a third-party. For instance, Reuters last week reported that after months of negotiations, Iran secured financing possibly through an Emirati leasing company for the first 17 planes it plans to buy from Airbus. If the U.S. Ex-Im Bank were to provide financing to such a third-party company, it would in effect be facilitating Iran's purchase of the aircraft. It is important to recall why Iran should not be receiving these planes in the first place: until President Obama implemented his nuclear deal, Iran Air had for over four years been subject to U.S. sanctions due to the company's notorious working relationship with Iran's military and Revolutionary Guards Corps. For years, Iran Air has smuggled rockets, missiles, and other sensitive materiel aboard its passenger and cargo planes bound for regional hotspots, such as Syria, home to Iranian terrorist proxies and murderous regimes. The Obama Administration was absolutely wrong to drop these sanctions in connection with the nuclear deal because this support has little or nothing to do with Iran's nuclear program. On the contrary, much of this activity is related to Iran's sponsorship of terrorism--for which the United States still imposes sanctions on Iran. It is long past time for the Administration to stop accommodating this genocidal regime and rather hold it to account. Just last week the IAEA reported that Iran had for the second time this year exceeded its quota for heavy water as stipulated in the nuclear deal. But instead of calling this violation what it is, the Obama Administration chose to sweep it under the rug. Such passivity in the face of Iranian violations only emboldens the regime to see what more it can get away with. This is a dangerous game to play when the consequences are so grave for our national security and that of our close ally Israel. The Administration's nuclear deal with Iran itself contained far too many major concessions: it recognized Iran's right to enrichment, despite longstanding United States policy against such recognition, and settled for a weak inspections regime that is anything but ``anytime, anywhere.'' We must act again today to put a stop to the concessions. For that reason, I urge my colleagues to pass this urgent measure. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate on the bill has expired. Amendment No. 1 Printed in Part A of House Report 114-818 Offered by Mr. Huizenga of Michigan Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 1, before line 1, insert the following: SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``No U.S. Financing for Iran Act''. Page 1, line 7, strike ``that is ordinarily incident to'' and insert ``in connection with''. Page 4, after line 3, insert the following: TITLE III--SUNSET SEC. 301. SUNSET. This Act and the amendment made by this Act shall cease to be effective on the date that is 30 days after the date on which the President certifies to Congress that the Government of Iran has ceased providing support for acts of international terrorism. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 921, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, at this point my amendment adds a short title and clarifies the nature of prohibited Iranian transactions. The amendment also provides for a sunset of the bill's provision upon presidential certification that Iran has ceased support of international terrorism. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this amendment and the underlying bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. HECK of Washington. The key change made by this amendment is to strike the phrase ``ordinarily incident to'' and insert ``in connection with.'' One is a term of art commonly used by the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC. Companies doing business with an OFAC license know what that means. In connection with is a much broader term, not clearly defined, Mr. Speaker, and if this amendment were to pass, exactly how attenuated of a connection would be impermissible? Crickets, because we don't know. I believe the chilling effect of this language would go far beyond the purported intent of this legislation. And let there be no confusion what the intent is, which is to block a single legal, fully compliant, and scandal-free business transaction that supports both our national security and American manufacturing. If this bill became law, we would be less safe. The U.S. specifically committed in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or the Iran Deal, as we refer to it, to allow the sale of commercial aircraft to Iran, as well as the provision of associated services. Associated services is specifically defined in the relevant section of the agreement to include financial services of the kind U.S. banks would be specifically blocked from providing under this bill. Well, it is hard to think of anything that would be a clearer violation of our own commitments under the JCPOA, an action that would give Iran a meaningful reason to walk away from the whole thing, making us less safe. It is a clear, black-and-white violation of the JCPOA. And what is our plan B if Congress provokes the collapse of this agreement? Crickets. We don't have one. Think of how much went into the successful negotiation of the agreement. We had to convince a lot of countries, with whom we don't often always agree, to maintain a united front for U.N. sanctions to be effective. If we choose to burn down the JCPOA, which this will do, entirely of our own volition, are my colleagues under any illusion that we could simply go back to our partners, not to mention Iran, and say with a straight face: Well, let's start over. And why wouldn't Iran just happily revel in the unraveling of the mighty international coalition which brought them to the table and go back to building up its nuclear program again? Again, crickets, because they would be likely to. So let's be clear. Yes, we continue to have numerous and serious differences with Iran. But as we counter their destabilizing behavior in other parts of the Middle East, I know I sleep better at night knowing that the Iran deal prevents them from obtaining a nuclear bomb with which to set off either a regional arms race or threaten our allies with nuclear blackmail. And frankly, if Iran is going to get new planes--and nothing in this bill will stop them, the choice is really not whether it is going to be Boeing or Airbus--I sleep better at night knowing that you have got American eyes on that plane in the form of the after-sale services for parts repair and American hands doing the maintenance to guard against the diversion from legitimate civil aviation use. It keeps us more safe if these are American-made planes. But even if we ignore all the compelling evidence that this bill will make us less safe, this bill fails spectacularly at preventing Iran from buying airplanes. In fact, I am certain it would hurt our own aerospace industry way more than it would hurt Iran. It is easy for foreign companies to get around this bill. They easily go to non-U.S. banks for financing. But American companies don't have that option to cut out U.S. banks entirely, unless you prefer that the proceeds from a sale be kept offshore, that American workers and communities [[Page H6264]] never see a dime of reinvestment, and the more than 100,000 jobs this transaction could support go to other countries. This bill is also an attack on a key pillar of support for our exporters, including the aerospace exporters, namely, the Ex-Im Bank. Despite the fact that the Ex-Im Bank already has a policy against this, despite the fact that there is law against this, despite the fact that the Ex-Im has said they won't do this, and despite the fact that the seller, Boeing, has said in writing they won't do this. This isn't belts and suspenders. This is stapling your pants to your flesh. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this bill that undermines foundational elements of our national and economic security, and, in so doing, I too am reminded of what President Reagan once said: ``It's not what you don't know that bothers me, it's what you think you know that ain't so.'' Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Washington, who has been a big proponent of the Export-Import Bank and a particular company that he was alluding to and talking about, knows, though, that this bill would apply to any aircraft that the Treasury authorizes for Iran. That includes the 17 Airbus planes for Iran Air. And he brought up, actually, offshore profits. Well, according to Bloomberg, Boeing has $800 million--$800 million in profits stashed offshore; and the reports are that Boeing is pursuing these deals with the Japanese bank already, not a U.S. bank. And apparently the company is less worried about this bill and that financing than my friend from Washington is. {time} 1900 So this is simply about saying that Iran does not have direct access to the U.S. financial system. I don't understand why my friends and colleagues on the other side of the aisle are so freaked out by that. This is simply about making sure that our banking system is not going to finance this deal indirectly or directly and that the use of the Export-Import Bank would be prohibited. This amendment says it is a sunset to this bill upon Presidential certification that Iran has ceased support of international terrorism-- a goal we all have. So if the President can support that and certify that, then this falls away. So we do not say that this deal is not allowed. We simply say that U.S. financial institutions cannot be used for this and that we cannot and will not use the Export-Import Bank--a U.S. taxpayer-funded entity--to do this. At the end of the day, in April of this past year, Secretary Jack Lew told us that there will be no access; and either he misled the United States citizens and this body at that time or they changed their mind. They haven't told us which, but neither one is acceptable. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the previous question is ordered on the bill, as amended, and on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga). The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga). The amendment was agreed to. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. Motion to Recommit Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill? Mr. SWALWELL of California. I am opposed in its current form. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: Mr. Swalwell of California moves to recommit the bill H.R. 5711 to the Committee on Financial Services with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith with the following amendment: Page 2, after line 2, insert the following new section: SEC. 103. PROTECTING U.S. ELECTIONS. The Secretary of the Treasury may not authorize a transaction described under section 101 by a U.S. financial institution if such institution is engaged in business with a foreign entity that has been found by the Secretary, in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, to have engaged in or authorized cyber attacks targeting any election held in the United States. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion. Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended. Mr. Speaker, this final amendment says plainly that no U.S. business may do business with a country that has used cyber attacks to undermine a U.S. election. So if my colleagues are genuine in believing that Iran is a hopeless adversary, then surely they will join me in believing that Russia, in its efforts to undermine our recent November election, should also be treated as such. This motion is really about the future of two U.S. adversaries: Iran and Russia. Iran, surely a bad actor over the last few decades, has finally in the last couple of years come to the international table and struck an agreement with the United States and many of our allies to make sure that we take it from being a country that is 3 months away from having a nuclear weapon to 1 year away. They continue to sponsor terrorism across the world. But today, better than ever before, we have eyes, ears, and checks and balances on them that we have never had. By the way, we can address all of their bad behavior with them being much farther away from having a nuclear weapon than they were before the Iran nuclear agreement. Russia, however, continues to wreak chaos in the Middle East supporting Syria and its brutal dictator Assad. Russia brought down a commercial airliner over Ukraine and has further incurred into Ukraine taking over Crimea. Russia continues to attack and escalate hostilities with U.S. personnel at our embassy in Moscow. Now the standard bearer for the Republican Party, President-elect Trump, has chosen to embrace Russia and take the United States on a new tack. So the question today is: If you believe Iran is hopeless, then do you believe that we should also make sure no U.S. business does business with a country that is trying to undermine our elections? I want to go through some of that evidence. On October 7 of this year, Director of National Intelligence Clapper said that the intelligence community is confident that the Russian Government directed cyber attacks aimed at disrupting our November elections. Why would Russia do this? Russia clearly had a favored candidate in this race in President- elect Trump. Russia has been successful. This amendment says that you cannot do business with any country that is trying to influence our elections. This amendment says that if you think Iran is a bad actor, then you have to treat Iran the same way you treat Russia. This amendment says that if you think the U.S. should allow businesses to do business with a country trying to undermine our elections, to undermine the will of our constituents, then you should vote against this amendment. If you are with Russia, then you should be against this motion. However, if you believe that we are closer to preventing Iran from having a nuclear weapon than we were a year ago, and if you believe that it is better for a U.S. manufacturer to provide commercial airliners to Iran and create U.S. jobs and have eyes and ears on what is going on over there, then you should be for this motion. But if you want our elections to be free and fair from outside influence, then vote for this motion. If you want to stand with Russia, then you should vote against this motion. So I ask my colleagues on the other side: Are you going to embrace the new U.S. foreign policy that your standard bearer has proposed, that we are going to undermine and unravel the agreement that we have struck with Iran and march millions of young men and women back into the Middle East, an area where we have not had major combat operations finally for the first time [[Page H6265]] in 15 years? Or do you think that we should treat Iran the same way that we are treating Russia? So I submit that to my colleagues, and I invite them to maybe engage on that question because that is what this motion is about: Do you stand with Russia? Or do you stand with preventing U.S. businesses from doing business with a country that our intelligence community has said has tried to undermine our elections? Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Well, America, you just heard a ridiculous straw-man choice laid out in front of you. Mr. Speaker, this is not about anything other than selling and financing aircraft sales to Iran. That is what this bill is about. This is what this bill should be about. I will point out to my colleague that there are some pretty major kinetic activities--I believe they are called at this point, which means shooting war--happening in Mosul and other places where our troops are involved. But at the end of the day, Mr. Speaker, I want to encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this motion to recommit. I look forward to working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to address concerns that we may have with other foreign governments in the future, and I would request that they vote for the underlying bill, H.R. 5711. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the order of the House of today, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. ____________________",package_114_207.csv,78723,78723,78797,"[congressional record volume 162, number 164 (wednesday, november 16, 2016)] [house] [pages h6255-h6265] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] prohibiting the secretary of the treasury from authorizing certain transactions relating to commercial passenger aircraft to iran mr. huizenga of michigan. mr. speaker, pursuant to house resolution 921, i call up the bill (h.r. 5711) to prohibit the secretary of the treasury from authorizing certain transactions by a u.s. financial institution in connection with the export or re-export of a commercial passenger aircraft to the islamic republic of iran, and ask for its immediate consideration in the house. the clerk read the title of the bill. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to house resolution 921, in lieu of the amendment recommended by the committee on financial services printed in the bill, an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of rules committee print 114-66 is adopted, and the bill, as amended, is considered read. the text of the bill, as amended, is as follows: h.r. 5711 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, title i--iran financing prohibition section 101. prohibition. the secretary of the treasury may not authorize a transaction by a u.s. financial institution (as defined under section 561.309 of title 31, code of federal regulations) that is ordinarily incident to the export or re-export of a commercial passenger aircraft to the islamic republic of iran. sec. 102. revocation of prior authorizations. if the secretary of the treasury authorized any transaction described under section 101 before the date of the enactment of this title, such authorization is hereby revoked. title ii--no ex-im assistance for terrorism sec. 201. short title. this title may be cited as the ``no ex-im assistance for terrorism act''.

following: ``(14) prohibition on financing that would benefit iran.-- ``(a) direct financing.--the bank shall not guarantee, insure, or extend (or participate in an extension of) credit in connection with any transaction with respect to which credit assistance from the bank is first sought after the effective date of this paragraph by-- ``(i) the government of iran or an entity owned or controlled

maxine waters) each will control 30 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from michigan. general leave mr. huizenga of michigan. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to submit extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from michigan? there was no objection. mr. huizenga of michigan. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. when our fellow americans deposit their earnings in a u.s. bank or entrust the government with their tax dollars, they do so assuming that their money will not be used in ways which undermine the security of our very nation and, frankly, of the world. the legislation we are debating tonight is a package of bills that is designed to prevent the obama administration from further undermining the trust of the american people and the security of our nation, as well as the security of our allies. under president obama's nuclear deal with iran, formally known as the joint comprehensive plan of action, or the jcpoa, the administration agreed to authorize the export of civilian aircraft to iran. what the jcpoa did not include was authorization for the u.s. financing of those sales. as treasury secretary jack lew said in april in a council on foreign relations speech: ``iran, complied with the nuclear agreement. therefore, the nuclear sanctions are lifted. i think that that is a process that is becoming more and more clear. and we'll keep our part of the bargain there. but the u.s. financial system is not open to iran and that is not something that is going to change.'' again, that was secretary jack lew in april of this past year. mr. speaker, something changed. in september, the treasury's office of foreign assets control issued licenses to airbus and to boeing that permitted the sale of up to 97 airplanes to iran air, the country's flagship, state-owned carrier. these licenses didn't stop there, however. by going beyond the scope of the jcpoa, they also authorized u.s. financial institutions to ``engage in all transactions necessary to provide financing or other financial services'' related to the iran air orders. my bill, h.r. 5711, would prohibit the secretary of the treasury from authorizing u.s. financing through american banks in connection with the export of commercial aircraft to iran just as the administration claimed was u.s. policy to begin with. this bill would keep americans' deposits away from a country that the president's own state department calls ``the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism'' and which the treasury has designated as ``a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern.'' let me repeat that. the state department, itself, says this is the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism, and the treasury department has designated a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern. how many more red flags need to go up? under this bill, americans would not have to fear that their savings are being channeled to iran air, which was sanctioned by the treasury in 2011 for ferrying soldiers and weapons of war to syria--the site of a 5-year conflict that has claimed a half a million lives and has displaced millions more. this is the same iran air that a u.n. report concluded had shared ballistic military technology with north korea and is the same iranian revolutionary guard corps whose deputy commander called for an end to israel, making note of more than 100,000 missiles that were ready ``for the annihilation--the wiping out--and the collapse of the zionist regime.'' additionally, research by the foundation for defense of democracies shows that iran air's support of the assad regime continues to this very day. why should u.s. banks and their customers be implicated in iranian atrocities? i would submit that there is no reasonable answer to this, which is why this commonsense prohibition, when offered as an amendment to this year's financial services appropriations bill, was passed by this very body--the house of representatives--by a voice vote. however, this bill goes even further, mr. speaker. not only will h.r. 5711 protect americans' bank accounts, it will prevent their tax dollars from being used through the export-import bank to subsidize aircraft sales to iran. it would be through direct transactions or third-party leasing, which is becoming more and more common. this codifies and strengthens an existing ex-im prohibition that is renewed in annual appropriations bills. for that reason, this measure enjoyed the support of ex-im supporters and critics alike when it came before the financial services committee. h.r. 5711 combines the text of two bills that were reported by the committee on financial services; one of them sponsored by me and the other by congressman roskam of illinois. both pieces of legislation were cosponsored by our democrat colleague, congressman sherman of california, who has devoted years to iran policy, both as a member of the financial services committee and of the foreign affairs committee. i thank representative sherman and representative roskam for working with me on this very important legislation package; and i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this important bill. i reserve the balance of my time. ms. maxine waters of california. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i am disappointed that we are here, yet again, debating another republican bill to undermine the iran nuclear deal--a deal that, so far, has delivered on its principal goal of blocking iran's path to nuclear weapons for the foreseeable future. this is a dangerous move that, if enacted, would put u.s. and global security at risk. specifically, h.r. 5711 would prohibit the treasury secretary from authorizing any transaction by a u.s. financial institution to support the export of commercial planes to iran. doing so would violate a key component of the agreement in which the u.s. has committed to allowing the sales of these planes and the associated financial [[page h6257]] services that are necessary to support the sales. earlier this year, the treasury department issued a license to boeing for the sale of 80 passenger planes to iran--valued at $17.6 billion-- and authorized u.s. financial institutions to engage in all transactions necessary to allow boeing to receive payment for the sale. this legislation not only puts the boeing deal in the crosshairs by prohibiting it from conducting a lawful sale under the agreement, but it also places the viability of the nuclear deal itself in question. moreover, this legislation would breach the good faith provision in the agreement by which all parties agreed not to undermine its successful implementation. h.r. 5711 also includes language that prevents the export-import bank from financing exports to iran, which is a red herring because the ex- im bank has not supported exports to iran since the 1970s, and it is legally prohibited from doing so as long as iran is a state sponsor of terror. notably, the bill removes the president's national security waiver with regard to these restrictions--a move that denies the president the flexibility that is necessary to work with our allies to find the most effective ways of changing iran's behavior. the fact is that all previous iran sanctions bills that have passed the house and that have become law have included a presidential waiver that gives the president the flexibility to act quickly and maneuver when doing so serves the u.s. national security interest. mr. speaker, i am particularly concerned that this bill comes at a time of deep global uncertainty about u.s. foreign policy. we have a president-elect whose talk on foreign policy has ranged from vague and contradictory in some areas to utterly incoherent elsewhere. he has inserted unpredictability into the international arena, has questioned the value of u.s. alliances, and has threatened the cornerstones of decades of american foreign policy leadership. yet, instead of reassuring the world that the united states is committed to working with our global allies to promote our collective security, house republicans have decided to push yet another piece of legislation through the house to destabilize the agreement that is central to preventing iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. {time} 1800 i do wonder why their leadership decided to bring this bill to the floor now in the lameduck session when they know the president will veto it. perhaps my colleagues on the other side of the aisle know that in two short months, they will no longer have the luxury of legislating without consequences. come january, we will have a president who has called the iran nuclear agreement the worst deal ever negotiated. like most of his other nonsense policies, mr. trump has claimed he will either more strictly enforce the agreement or negotiate ``a much better deal'' or dismantle it altogether. we don't know, and he doesn't know. so i am going to bet that, under the trump administration, republicans will not be so eager to move legislation to unravel this agreement because, like the rest of us, they do not know how mr. trump will govern and because they know there is no other reasonable approach to curbing iran's nuclear ambition, short of military intervention. i, therefore, urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this bill and sending a strong message to the president-elect and our allies around the world that democrats remain committed to a strong u.s. engagement in the world and will not tolerate any attempt to undermine the iran nuclear deal or any other international arrangements that keep us safe. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. huizenga of michigan. mr. speaker, i yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from illinois (mr. roskam), a leader on this issue who is the author of h.r. 5715. mr. roskam. mr. speaker, i thank the gentleman from michigan (mr. huizenga) and also chairman hensarling for their consistent and persistent work on this issue. my friend from california mentioned a minute ago her disappointment. well, if you want to talk about disappointment and destabilizing of the deal, just look at what the iranians have done since the jcpoa passed. by the way, a majority of the house of representatives and a majority of the united states senate, not on a partisan basis either, mr. speaker, voted against the jcpoa. so let's put that in context. but the president insisted, he moved along, and here we are. so let's see what we can do about it. before we fix it, let's look at what the iranians have done. they are the destabilizers. there have been iranian-supplied rockets launched at a u.s. naval ship. iran has fired rockets within 1,500 feet in december of last year on u.s. ships numerous times. the irgc patrol boats have aggressively harassed u.s. ships in the strait of hormuz. iran has launched numerous ballistic missile tests in violation of the u.n. security council resolutions. they violated the jcpoa by producing excess heavy water. they continue to kidnap americans and hold them for ransom. so let's put it where it lies. the destabilizing impact doesn't belong with the united states. it doesn't belong with any statement by an american policyholder. the destabilizing nature belongs, mr. speaker, to the iranian regime, the mullahs themselves. so the gentlewoman from california said she is disappointed. well, look, i mean, disappointment, get used to it. it is the nature of things. the nature of the disappointment is that we now have american companies that are saying: you know what? let's go in and let's do business with a terrorist regime. how is that? let's just go make a buck. that is the scandal of this. the scandal is that there are american companies, there are international companies--boeing, airbus--that are now making their own names inextricably linked with terror forever more. that is the scandal. so what are we trying to do? the gentlewoman said that the ex-im elements of this--i think she said--was a red herring. if not, it was words to that effect. no, it is not so. because if you look carefully at what the ex-im prohibition actually prohibits, mr. speaker, it prohibits the direct financing to the iranian regime. fine, if that is all this did, well and good. there is no reason to oppose it, then. of course, that is not where the ex-im is actually limited. because here is what can happen: under current law, the ex-im bank can do a deal with the europeans, for example. what can happen, then? that can be leased under current law to the iranians. this amendment, mr. huizenga's language, would prohibit that. that is what we are trying to do. look, think about the irony of this. you have got an administration that currently is telling americans it is a dangerous thing to go to iran; that you are at risk of being kidnapped if you go to iran. at the same time--picture this, mr. speaker--that that is being articulated, they are also saying: we are going to help you do some business over there. that is ridiculous. it is absurd, it is contradictory, and it is indefensible. so here is the good news: the good news is we can do something about it. the other good news is this iran deal has a very short shelf life because the president-elect has said he doesn't like it. president obama didn't do the hard work of developing a national consensus on it. if he had, it would have been a treaty and a treaty that would have bound the united states in permanency; but he didn't do that. why? because it was a bad idea and he couldn't sell it to congress. so he went the easy way, did it basically by executive order. and what goes around comes around. so we can do some good work here today. we can move this out. is president obama going to sign it? obviously not, but that is not to say that it is not what we should do. we know what we need to do. we need to make sure that the american financial system is not complicit in this deal. we need to make sure that american taxpayers are not subsidizing this deal. i urge the bill's passage. ms. maxine waters of california. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from connecticut (mr. himes), a member of the financial services committee and the house [[page h6258]] permanent select committee on intelligence. mr. himes. mr. speaker, with all due respect to the gentleman from michigan, once again, we find ourselves in this dreary and dangerous ritual of considering a bill which, without question, would cause us to violate our agreement under the jcpoa. we get the same arguments about how bad the iranian regime is, and we get the same misstatements like: this is president obama's deal. it is not president obama's deal. it is a deal of the united nations security council, of china, of russia, of great britain, of france, of germany, the u.k., and the rest of the world who combined working for a period of almost 15 years hammered out a deal--and i say this as a member of the house permanent select committee on intelligence--which today has removed iran as a nuclear threat. yet, here again, we are offered a bill that would compromise our obligations and almost certainly result in centrifuges spinning once again in tehran and then leading on to the very likely prospect of yet another middle eastern war. yes, iran is a sponsor of terrorism. yes, it is a bad place. you will get no argument from this side of the aisle that this is a bad regime. once again, i remind my republican friends that their patron saint, ronald reagan, made a nuclear deal with the soviet union, also a sponsor of terrorism, an appalling regime; but ronald reagan was smart enough to know that you can make a deal that makes everybody safer even with some very bad people. ronald reagan. one thing i know as a member of the house permanent select committee on intelligence is that what used to be a mortal national security threat to the united states--2 to 3 months from breakout time, 2 to 3 months over which would almost certainly be involved in yet another war in the middle east--has been taken off the table. now, the republicans not only seek to scuttle that deal with all of the implications, but they do it by stopping an american company from selling a flagship american product around the world. if you use the department of commerce's multiplier, the bill they are pushing today would result in 100,000 american jobs not created so that they can continue with this fetish of eliminating a deal, which has made us safer. if there is any question about whether this has made us safer, let me again quote general gadi eizenkot, who is the chief of staff of the israeli defense forces. he said the deal has actually removed the most serious danger to israel's existence for the foreseeable future and greatly reduced the threat over the longer term. that is the chief of staff of the israeli defense forces, but my friends in the republican party know better about what is good for israel. these sad charades end pretty soon because the bluff has been called. president trump has said he will tear up the iran deal. when he does that--because this, of course, is not becoming law--the centrifuges will spin again. to my friends on the other side of the aisle, when the centrifuges are spinning, we and i will stand here and we will tell the american people why centrifuges are spinning again. and where we were 2 years ago when we thought we were going to war with iran, if we go to iran, when israeli planes are bombing iran, we will stand here and explain why we are now in another middle eastern war. we can avoid that by ending these charades and finally accepting this deal. mr. huizenga of michigan. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from ohio (mr. chabot), who is the chairman of the small business committee, but also a previous chair of the foreign affairs subcommittee on the middle east and north africa. mr. chabot. mr. speaker, i rise in strong support of h.r. 5711. i want to the commend my colleagues, congressmen huizenga and sherman, for authoring this bipartisan piece of legislation. it was once said that the west would sell its enemies the rope that would be used to hang itself with. well, because of the disastrously flawed iran deal, that is exactly what we are currently doing. that is why this legislation is so important. h.r. 5711 essentially prevents the export or reexport of commercial passenger aircraft to the islamic republic of iran. this bill would cut off iran's means of delivering weapons to terrorist organizations like hamas and hezbollah, and to syrian dictator bashir al-assad, a war criminal who is responsible for the worst refugee crisis since the second world war. the truth is we wouldn't even need to be here today if the obama administration had just paid attention to the facts on the ground in the middle east. when negotiating the disastrous iran nuclear deal, despite knowing iran was the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, president obama and secretary kerry permitted the sale of commercial aircraft to iran anyway. incredibly, under current u.s. law, if we issued a license for iran air to purchase aircraft from an american manufacturer and then iran walked away from its commitment, u.s. taxpayers would have to foot the bill for iran. in this case, that could be up to $70 billion on the u.s. taxpayer. given iran air's multiple unpaid commitments over the years, that outrageous outcome is entirely possible. so for all of the reasons that i have mentioned and for reasons that have been stated already by my colleagues, i would urge clear-minded people on both sides of the aisle to support this legislation. ms. maxine waters of california. mr. speaker, i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from north carolina (mr. price), a senior member of the house appropriations committee. mr. price of north carolina. mr. chairman, i rise in strong opposition to h.r. 5711. this legislation is only the latest misguided and politicized effort by the majority to undermine the joint comprehensive plan of action, a historic agreement negotiated by the world's major powers in order to keep iran from developing a nuclear weapon. simply put, enactment of h.r. 5711 would violate the united states government's obligations under the jcpoa, opening the door for iran to walk away from this agreement. it also threatens to undermine our credibility with our allies and negotiating partners. now, we must be vigilant. no one disagrees that we must be vigilant in ensuring iranian compliance with the terms of the jcpoa. we also should continue to hold iran to account for its violations of human rights, for its sponsorship of terrorism, and for its nonnuclear weapons development. last night, i supported, as did almost every member of this body, a clean reauthorization of the iran sanctions extension act, which guarantees congress' ability to snap back sanctions should iran violate the jcpoa. the reauthorization also allows congress to take positive action on transition day should it be verified that iran has used its nuclear capacity only for peaceful purposes. so the continued authorization of sanctions will allow the united states to continue to exert pressure on the iranian regime. the dangerous bill before us today will do just exactly the opposite. by directly blocking a specific provision of the jcpoa--namely, the permissible sale of commercial passenger aircraft--this legislation would send a clear message to the iranian people that the united states does not negotiate in good faith; that we expect to have it both ways, with iran dismantling its nuclear facilities and getting nothing in return. {time} 1815 we must also remember, my colleagues, that the iran nuclear agreement is not just a bilateral agreement between iran and the united states. it is the product of years and years of negotiations between iran and the p5+1, which is the united kingdom, china, france, russia, germany, and the united states. the bill before us today would break faith with those negotiating partners in a reckless and dangerous way. because of this agreement, the breakout time for iran to develop enough weapons-grade material for a nuclear weapon went from 2 to 3 months to a year or more. because of this agreement, the international community has 24/7 access to iran's nuclear sites. because of this agreement, we possess the enforcement mechanisms necessary to verify iran's compliance. [[page h6259]] by all objective accounts, iran has upheld its end of the bargain. why would we give up these capabilities by failing to uphold ours? in light of the political transitions taking place in our country, now is especially the time when the united states must keep its word, its word to our allies and to the international community. now, regardless of all this, it appears that our republican colleagues are willing to jeopardize a major international agreement for political advantage. they are willing to undermine the credibility of the united states and our allies on the international stage. my colleagues, instead of scoring political points or seeking to undo the foreign policy legacy of the outgoing president, we should be working together in a bipartisan manner to ensure this agreement's success. for that reason, i urge colleagues to vote against this bill. mr. huizenga of michigan. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. rothfus), a member of the house committee on financial services. mr. rothfus. mr. speaker, i rise today in strong support of h.r. 5711. despite the president's assurances, iran remains a menace to the stability of the middle east and a threat to america and its allies. all of us, both republicans and democrats, need to take action to reduce the harm that this rogue state and its accomplices can do. h.r. 5711 takes some very important steps in that effort. by prohibiting the secretary of the treasury from green-lighting u.s. financing for the export of commercial aircraft to iran, we are making it more difficult for iranian airlines to acquire planes that we know are used to ferry soldiers and weapons. i need to ask my colleagues across the aisle: is that such a bad idea? by blocking ex-im assistance to the government of iran, we are preventing the u.s. taxpayer from subsidizing efforts by the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism to acquire aircraft to support its deadly activities around the world. we can all agree that ex-im should never be used for this purpose. the government of iran continues to fund terrorist activities, and it is intimately involved in syria's violent civil war. let us not forget the recent hostile actions taken by houthi rebels in yemen. these rebels receive funds from iran, and they fired missiles at u.s. navy warships on patrol in the red sea. the american people cannot be complicit in these hostilities. we owe it to our constituents and our allies around the world to pass this commonsense legislation. i thank my colleagues from michigan, illinois, and california for introducing this bill. i urge its support. ms. maxine waters of california. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from texas (mr. doggett), a member of the committee on ways and means. mr. doggett. mr. speaker, will this congress ground boeing or support this key manufacturer and the jobs that it creates, that have already helped make america great? will we march to the tune of the pied pipers against peace who see war with iran as the only way to restrain it from developing nuclear weapons? part of what makes trade so important to us is that countries that trade together are less likely to go to war with one another. the house today is being asked to vote to block the sale of about 80 boeing aircraft to update an aging and unsafe commercial airline in iran. if this bill passes, that is bad news for a major american business, and it is also bad news to thousands of skilled workers across this country who won't see any part of what could be a $25 billion deal. it is great news for boeing's major european competitor to get the work that these supporters would deny to boeing. this is, of course, just the latest of one effort after another to undermine the only way forward, short of war, to limit iran's ability to develop nuclear weapons. this realization is why this very week so many national security experts have urged mr. trump to reconsider, to reverse his threat to break the promises that our country made in an international agreement. this week also, the european union affirmed its support for that international agreement. the six other countries that joined us in that international agreement are honoring their promises, and we should do the same thing. what will keep boeing from flying high? it is the war hawks that fly high, so insistent on undermining this important pact that has made our family safer. if the hawks win, it is about more than losing a multibillion-dollar deal to one american manufacturer. it really means that nothing--nothing--but the threat of another american war, an american attack, will hold iran back from developing nuclear weapons. this is about more than destabilizing the american workforce. undermining this agreement will destabilize the middle east. it will jeopardize our families and the families of our allies. once again, this measure should be rejected. mr. huizenga of michigan. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from north carolina (mr. pittenger), a member of the committee on financial services. mr. pittenger. mr. speaker, today i rise to voice my support for h.r. 5711 and to thank congressman huizenga for his leadership on this very important issue. this bill prohibits the secretary of the treasury from authorizing certain transactions by u.s. financial institutions in connection with the export or reexport of a commercial passenger aircraft to the islamic republic of iran. as the primary sponsor of terrorism throughout the world, it is imperative that we hold iran accountable and do all we can to limit their abilities to promote this type of action and behavior. this bill confronts the same airline that has been sanctioned by the treasury department for transporting fighters and weapons on behalf of iran's revolutionary guard. it is beyond me how the administration can be okay with allowing iran access to airplanes which would only further their support of terrorism. i supported this commonsense legislation when it was marked up in the committee on financial services, and i am proud to support it today. thank you to my good friend, congressman huizenga, for sponsoring this legislation. ms. maxine waters of california. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from texas (ms. jackson lee), the ranking member of the subcommittee on crime, terrorism, homeland security, and investigations on the committee on the judiciary. ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, i thank the gentlewoman from california, ranking member waters, for the leadership that she gave this issue in the committee on financial services, and i rise today to offer my opposition to this bill for a number of reasons. i will say that it is interesting--i heard my colleague from north carolina mention the soviet union and the interests and the efforts that president reagan made to, in fact, make america safer in his time and in his context. interestingly, in the backdrop of today, one could now argue that russia has, in its portfolio, advocacy for terrorists as well as a large profile of cyberterrorism and hacking into the united states as well as a blatant interference in the most recent presidential election. as i look to my colleagues speaking about what the president-elect will do, i would hope that he would not undermine the national security of this nation. first of all, we know that this bill will be vetoed if it gets to the desk of president obama. this bill would damage a hard-fought diplomatic solution that makes the world safer from nuclear war. the sanctions are working, including extensive monitoring of the nuclear capability of iran. we also, in a bipartisan manner, supported the potential extinction of iran sanctions yesterday, and that was the right thing to do, the opportunity or the possibility of doing that. but this bill, in particular, flies in the face of a realistic approach to how we do international engagement. the jcpoa has significantly constrained iran's nuclear program. key aspects of the program are dismantled under the jcpoa, and it subjects iran's nuclear program to unprecedented verification and monitoring requirements. it is working. it is profoundly in the national security interests of the united states to continue to meet our commitments [[page h6260]] under the jcpoa as long as iran continues to meet its commitments. our allies are depending on us. the word of the united states should mean something. we even know that israel has seen a positive impact, some of its military persons have indicated, by way of the jcpoa. the speaker pro tempore. the time of the gentlewoman has expired. ms. maxine waters of california. mr. speaker, i yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman. ms. jackson lee. this bill prohibits the involvement of u.s. financial institutions in the sale of commercial passenger aircraft to iran air, civil end use that would put u.s. aircraft manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage with their foreign competitors whose access to financing would not be subject to the same constraints. this is not putting commercialism or jobs above national security. it is, in fact, allowing civil end use to continue as we are standing for our national security. the sweeping and vague nature of this provision would have a chilling effect on u.s. and non-u.s. entities seeking to engage in permissible business with iran. the united states has a long tradition of remaining faithful to our commitments with our international partners, and a reversal of this principle undercuts our credibility, diminishes our ability to lead globally, and threatens the very alliances we rely upon in implementing the jcpoa. we can anticipate that should this bill become law, our closest allies would view this bill as a violation of the jcpoa commitments, and iran would take the issue to the joint commission. the main thing of this bill is that it will douse the friendship and alliance that we are making with allies who want a peaceful nonproliferation of nuclear activity. this is a ``no'' vote in order to provide for the national security of this nation. mr. huizenga of michigan. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from arizona (mr. schweikert), a member of the house committee on financial services. mr. schweikert. mr. speaker, i thank chairman huizenga for the couple minutes. this is one of those moments, has anyone actually read the four pages on the bill? great. in that case, we should all know this isn't about selling jets. it is about using the american financial system to finance them. that is what the language of the bill is. think about this. we have now spent the last 6 years around this body talking over and over and over how we are going to keep the american financial system safe, how we are going to not do things that concentrate debt within our capital markets. if iran wants to buy jets, let them go find bilateral agreements in other countries. let them show up with the cash. let them go find someone else to put up the surety bonds. let someone else go put up the coverage on the lost pieces on the ladder of the financing. this piece of legislation coming through the committee on financial services is about protecting our financial system, first, from what many of us on the committee believe is going to turn into bad debt and functionally become toxic within our financial markets; but then, secondly, do you really want the united states financial system providing liquidity and financing for the leading state sponsor of terrorism in the world? that is a pretty powerful ethical question when you consider what we have been through in cleaning up our own financial system over the last few years. ms. maxine waters of california. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i am sorry that mr. pittenger left because i really did want to share this point with him. it is important to note that nothing in this legislation will keep new passenger aircraft out of the hands of iran. the bill only prevents boeing from selling civilian passenger aircraft to iran, while foreign aircraft manufacturers, such as airbus, will still be able to sell their passenger planes to iran since they won't need u.s. financial institutions to help finance their deals. {time} 1830 what is this? is this some kind of payback to boeing? is this some kind of---- mr. huizenga of michigan. will the gentlewoman yield? ms. maxine waters of california. i yield to the gentleman from michigan. mr. huizenga of michigan. that is actually not true. airbus is subject to this as well because of the significant number of parts and material in the jets that they produce. so they would be subject to this as well as boeing. ms. maxine waters of california. reclaiming my time, there is nothing in this legislation that will keep new passenger aircraft out of the hands of iran. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. huizenga of michigan. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from texas (mr. williams), who is also a member of the house financial services committee. mr. williams. mr. speaker, i thank congressman huizenga for his leadership. mr. speaker, the obama administration's state department recognizes the islamic republic of iran as one of three state sponsors of terrorism. but, ironically, the president calls his deal with iran a foreign policy achievement. our commander in chief is proud of his plan that puts iran on the path to getting a nuclear weapon. he is proud of his plan that condones and facilitates u.s. business with iran. in september, the treasury department authorized the sale of up to 97 airbus and boeing planes to iran. iran is more than just a labeled state sponsor of terrorism. iran uses its financial sector for international money laundering. iran has been a long-time supporter of the brutal assad regime in syria. it has supported a government that has killed hundreds of thousands of its own people. iran's leader has pledged to wipe america and israel off the map, but none of these facts matter to the obama administration. they will do whatever they can just to make a deal and ensure a legacy. mr. speaker, why are we rewarding and aiding a nation that has contributed to so much disorder and destruction in the middle east? to me, it is simply a no-brainer. we must not authorize u.s. aircraft sales to iran. i urge my colleagues to pass h.r. 5711, which would prohibit the treasury secretary from authorizing u.s. financing in connection with commercial passenger aircraft to iran. in god we trust. ms. maxine waters of california. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i would like to share a portion of a letter from j street: j street calls on members of congress to oppose anti-jcpoa bill restricting commercial aircraft sales. the last paragraph says: ``additionally, the bill would not even achieve its intended objective of preventing iran from acquiring commercial aircraft--it would merely ensure that iran purchases them from a foreign producer, pointlessly denying jobs and income to working americans and communities across the country. like so many of the legislative attempts by jcpoa opponents to undermine or kill the agreement, this bill is just another cynical messaging exercise that hurts rather than helps america's essential interests, security, and standing in the world. ``j street therefore urges members of congress to oppose h.r. 5711 and reaffirm the united states' commitment to uphold its international obligations.'' mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. huizenga of michigan. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from maine (mr. poliquin), a distinguished member of the house financial services committee. mr. poliquin. mr. speaker, i thank chairman huizenga and also chairman hensarling for bringing this very important issue before the american people. mr. speaker, it is a horrible idea to allow the united states government to help the iranian government support terrorism. this bill helps make sure that does not happen. now, the world knows that the iranian government has a very long history of using their state-owned iran air to transport weapons and military personnel for the revolutionary guard, which, in turn, trains, arms, and funds [[page h6261]] terrorist organizations around the world. the revolutionary guard and the government of iran has american blood on its hands. it should be very concerning to everybody in this chamber, republicans and democrat, that the iranian leaders for years have chanted, death to america, and have vowed to wipe the state of israel off the map. the iranian government cannot be trusted. now, the united states financial institutions should not be allowed to help the iranian government purchase aircraft and other equipment proven to be used for military purposes. mr. speaker, this bill, h.r. 5711, is a good, commonsense bill. i implore everybody in this chamber, republicans and democrats, to do what is right and to stand up and vote ``yes'' for h.r. 5711 to make sure we do not assist the chief sponsor of terrorism in this world to conduct its activities. ms. maxine waters of california. mr. speaker, i like mr. poliquin. he is a nice man. he always has a nice smile. but i don't trust him more than i trust j street. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. huizenga of michigan. mr. speaker, i would like to inquire as to the balance of the time remaining on both sides. the speaker pro tempore (mr. knight). the gentleman from michigan has 10\1/2\ minutes remaining. the gentlewoman from california has 10\1/4\ minutes remaining. mr. huizenga of michigan. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from arkansas (mr. hill), who is a member of the financial services committee and a former treasury official. mr. hill. mr. speaker, i thank my friend from michigan for yielding. i rise in strong support of h.r. 5711. and i thank the gentleman from california (mr. sherman), who serves on our committee, for his leadership on this measure and consistently works on matters concerning iran, as well as mr. roskam of illinois. i was proud to be a member this past congress on the financial services committee task force to investigate terrorism financing. during our hearings, mr. speaker, we heard numerous witnesses describe iran's support for terrorism and other evil activities. it is really staggering, mr. speaker, that we sit here tonight and we have a member of the other party suggest that iran is a friend to the united states. there is no friendship between iran and the united states or our allies. i think that is a stunning thing to say on the house floor. you have heard tonight about iran's direct involvement in conflicts in iraq, syria, yemen; their support of hamas, hezbollah. and one of the main methods they use to support their terrorist activities around the world is they are flying commercial aircraft by the quds force around this world supporting terrorism, supplying assad in syria, who is responsible for the deaths of hundreds. this deal is not about blocking airplane sales, mr. speaker. this deal is about protecting taxpayers on financing airplane sales, protecting our banks in the financing of airplane sales. in fact, mr. speaker, the obama administration has already provided the government of iran, the mullahs in iran over $100 billion in freed-up cash and has given them $1.7 billion in euros in cash on pallets. let them use that to buy an aircraft. let's assume they cost $100 million, $150 million. they can buy several aircraft and pay cash, thanks to the failed diplomacy of the obama administration. so, again, this legislation is about the belief that the united states should not directly support terrorism and the killing of innocent civilians. the speaker pro tempore. the time of the gentleman has expired. mr. huizenga of michigan. mr. speaker, i yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. mr. hill. mr. speaker, i support this bill. it is the mission of iran to use these aircraft for nefarious purposes. we already have that guilt on our hands by the release of $100 billion and $1.7 billion in cash. let's not compound the errors of the past by opposing this bill, which will limit taxpayer risk and our financial sector risk at financing aircraft to iran. ms. maxine waters of california. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. huizenga of michigan. mr. speaker, may i inquire as to the balance of my time? the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman from michigan has 8 minutes remaining. mr. huizenga of michigan. mr. speaker, i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from illinois (mr. dold), a distinguished member, friend, and former member of the house financial services committee. mr. dold. mr. speaker, i want to thank my good friend from michigan for yielding. mr. speaker, i just find it fascinating that here we are again. listen, we can talk about the jcpoa, this iran nuclear deal, which i think is a historic mistake, which will haunt us for generations. there is no question about that. if anybody was unclear about where i stand or where i think many in this body stand, let me just simply say that i think this will be a historic mistake that will haunt us. ultimately, when we are talking about the world's greatest state sponsor of terrorism, what is amazing to me is the fact that this is not even up for debate in the administration. the administration will tell you: yes, iran is the world's greatest state sponsor of terror. and you know what? with this agreement, if our destination was to say, you know what, we want to ensure that iran is never able to get a nuclear weapon, this deal all but ensures it. bob menendez, a democrat over in the senate, said those very words. prime minister netanyahu says this is a historic mistake. so, yes, we can talk about some of the others over there who believe this is a good thing, but ultimately we realize this is a bad thing. this is a bad thing because, frankly, as we talk about quoting j street on the floor, i personally want to say that i will trust bruce poliquin from maine, my colleague on the financial services committee. when it comes to a financing bill, yes, i trust bruce poliquin a heck of a lot more than i trust j street. j street, frankly, is in the tank for the other side. they are not an objective body, i believe. ultimately, as we look at this bill, mr. speaker, this bill doesn't prevent the sale of aircraft. as much as i would like to prevent the sale of aircraft to the world's greatest state sponsor of terror, which could use the aircraft to send supplies and soldiers--because we know that iran is sending money and supplies to hezbollah, hamas, to assad in syria. frankly, this administration will tell you the same thing. this is a bill that prevents the financing. ultimately, as we look at, how do we protect taxpayer dollars, how do we protect the deposits of millions of americans that go to main street and deposit in their local banks? we are just saying, you can't use financing to go finance the planes that are going over into iran, the world's greatest state sponsor of terror. if they want to pay cash, it would be one thing to say, you know what? i don't think you have got any cash. wait, we know they have got cash. why? because we just sent an unmarked plane with unmarked bills full of cash, ultimately, we know, for the release of hostages. we have got $1.7 billion that we know is there. we have got $100 billion worth of sanctions relief. you know what, i am counting on the fact that they have got the resources to spend. so what this is doing is this is trying to protect the american taxpayer. ultimately, what we do know, the administration agrees to authorize the export of civilian aircraft to iran. that still can happen. this bill does not change that one iota. what it does do is it says that you cannot use u.s. financing for those sales. ultimately, i think that is a good thing because when we look and we want to go back and they want to talk about it, this is something about the jcpoa, the iran deal. what is interesting to me, mr. speaker, is that the only thing that was bipartisan in the iran deal was its opposition in this body to that deal. frankly, i think we ought to be doing everything in our power to make sure that we keep and hold iran accountable, and we should not be financing planes that go in there because, ultimately, we know they have already [[page h6262]] fired missiles. right? they have already broken their agreements. they have fired missiles. they have fired weapons over at u.s. ships. they have captured u.s. sailors. they are taking hostages. this is not a good actor. frankly, we should be doing everything in our power to make sure that we are holding them accountable and ratcheting up sanctions. we should not make it easier for them to be able to purchase planes. frankly, we have got all manufacturers that are out there that have parts in the united states that would be implicated with this. so this is not singling out a single u.s. carrier. we want to talk about pro-growth, but what we don't want to do is talk about pro-growth opportunities that are going to help the world's greatest state sponsor of terror. this is a mistake if we do not pass this piece of legislation. i am confident that this bipartisan piece of legislation is going to be able to pass this house. my hope is that the senate will take it up. i don't believe that the president will sign it--and i think that will be a mistake--but that should not prevent this body from doing the right thing. so, mr. speaker, i am going to go right back to where we started at the beginning. the world's greatest state sponsor of terror should not be aided by the u.s. taxpayer, by our banking system, in order to finance planes that we really don't know what they are going to do with them. but what we do know is that iran is a bad actor and they are going to continue to be the world's greatest state sponsor of terror. so i am going to urge my colleagues to support this bill. it is a commonsense piece of bipartisan legislation. i want to thank the chairman for his work on it, and i want to thank chairman hensarling as well. i want to thank mr. roskam, and i want to thank everybody here who is going to stand up united to say, this is going to something that we need to hold iran accountable to. {time} 1845 ms. maxine waters of california. mr. speaker, i have no further requests for time, and i am prepared to close. i yield myself the balance of my time. mr. speaker, i was surprised to hear the gentleman from illinois just repeating some of the outrageous statements that mr. trump made during the campaign where he talked about the airplane carrying billions of dollars to iran. i guess we are going to be hearing a lot of that around here. mr. speaker, next year, president-elect trump will face a daunting array of international challenges. the most pressing of these will be curbing islamic terrorism, reining in russian corruption and hegemony, and dealing with the civil wars in iraq and syria. the self-proclaimed islamic state, though it is in retreat in iraq and syria, has demonstrated its ability to operate beyond the confines of the middle east and sponsor attacks in asia, europe, and the united states. moreover, the nuclear threat posed by north korea will require an immediate and coherent policy response from the trump administration. so if ever there was a time when the u.s. should be affirming our commitment to the international agreements that promote our stability and security in such a volatile global environment, the time is now. we should be working to reassure our allies and the rest of the world that the u.s. is committed to internationalism and to shaping and preserving the world economic and political order. yet, republicans are intent on playing politics and continuing their futile attempts to undermine the iran nuclear agreement and put the global community at risk of a nuclear iran. over the past few months, this house passed republican bills to reinstate a program denying iranian financial institutions access to u.s. dollars; to prohibit the u.s. from buying heavy water from iran, a key component for some nuclear reactors; and most recently, to prohibit so-called ransom payments to iran, which would, in fact, put the u.s. in violation of its international obligations under the algiers accords, which have been in effect since 1981, under both republican and democratic administrations. the white house has issued a statement of policy making it clear that the president would veto the bill before us today, stating: ``the united states has a long tradition of remaining faithful to our commitments and our international partners, and a reversal of this principle undercuts our credibility, diminishes our ability to lead globally, and threatens the very alliances we rely upon in implementing the jcpoa.'' we know that this bill would violate a key provision of the joint comprehensive plan of action that specifically committed to the sale of commercial planes to iran by prohibiting our financial institutions from facilitating those sales. it also would put u.s. aircraft manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage with their foreign competitors, whose access to financing would not be subject to the same constraints. the legislation is also concerning because it would remove the president's national security waiver with regard to restrictions on the export-import bank's ability to finance exports to iran. while the administration has never exercised this authority, i believe removing the president's discretion and leverage on critical national security matters would be a serious mistake. so i strongly oppose this bill that aims to undo the hard-fought progress to contain iran's nuclear ambitions and undercuts our ability to exercise global leadership, and i urge my colleagues to do the same. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. huizenga of michigan. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, to quote the great american president, ronald reagan: ``there you go again.'' attack the president-elect, and try to throw out red herrings. the bill that we have before us has two simple titles, the iran financing prohibition--and i will read section 101: ``the secretary of the treasury may not authorize a transaction by a u.s. financial institution.'' section 102, revocation of prior authorizations: ``if the secretary of the treasury authorized any transaction described under section 101 before the date of the enactment of this title, such authorization is hereby revoked.'' we are halfway through. section 2, title ii, no ex-im assistance for terrorism. it simply says that there is a prohibition--on section 202: ``prohibition on export-import bank financing that would benefit iran.'' that means direct financing. that would be subhead a. indirect financing, meaning you can't have a third party get that lending from the export-import bank, by the way, a u.s. taxpayer-funded bank. so that is subhead b. and c is cancellation of approved financing, if they have done that already. this bill is not that complicated, and this bill does not cite any particular company. it does not limit any company from selling aircraft to iran, no matter how big of a mistake that might be. it simply says--as i might add, secretary jack lew, secretary of the treasury, said in april of this year: there will be no u.s. financial institution financing this deal. and we have added that second section, that second title that says: there will be no use of the u.s. taxpayer- financed export-import bank. that is all this bill says. so you have heard attacks on the president-elect. you have heard attacks on the export-import bank and whether this is going to be good or bad for u.s. employers and employees. the simple fact is, mr. speaker, that this bill, h.r. 5711, says: we are not going to allow u.s. financial institutions, and u.s. financial institutions only, to be used to finance these deals; and we are not going to allow the export-import bank of the united states to be used, either directly or indirectly, to finance that deal. iran can go put this deal together with other banks in asia, europe, anywhere else in the world that they can find it, but not here in the united states and not using taxpayer dollars. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. smith of new jersey. mr. speaker, i rise today to urge my colleagues to support [[page h6263]] h.r. 5711, the no u.s. financing for iran act, introduced by my good friend bill huizenga. this bill also includes the outstanding work of my good friend peter roskam, who introduced h.r. 5715, the no ex-im assistance for terrorism act. mr. speaker, president obama has made an endless stream of concessions to the iranian government. most recently, in september, the administration announced that it would issue special export licenses for boeing and airbus to sell dozens of commercial aircraft to iran--a deal that together is valued at upwards of $50 billion. yet the deal is not finalized because iran is having difficulty financing it. the no u.s. financing for iran act will guarantee that the u.s. plays no part in facilitating this financing: it blocks the treasury department from authorizing u.s. financial institutions from supporting such transactions and prevents the u.s. export-import bank from extending direct or indirect credit to the government of iran. although the ex-im bank is prohibited from providing direct financing to iran, it could do so through a third-party. for instance, reuters last week reported that after months of negotiations, iran secured financing possibly through an emirati leasing company for the first 17 planes it plans to buy from airbus. if the u.s. ex-im bank were to provide financing to such a third-party company, it would in effect be facilitating iran's purchase of the aircraft. it is important to recall why iran should not be receiving these planes in the first place: until president obama implemented his nuclear deal, iran air had for over four years been subject to u.s. sanctions due to the company's notorious working relationship with iran's military and revolutionary guards corps. for years, iran air has smuggled rockets, missiles, and other sensitive materiel aboard its passenger and cargo planes bound for regional hotspots, such as syria, home to iranian terrorist proxies and murderous regimes. the obama administration was absolutely wrong to drop these sanctions in connection with the nuclear deal because this support has little or nothing to do with iran's nuclear program. on the contrary, much of this activity is related to iran's sponsorship of terrorism--for which the united states still imposes sanctions on iran. it is long past time for the administration to stop accommodating this genocidal regime and rather hold it to account. just last week the iaea reported that iran had for the second time this year exceeded its quota for heavy water as stipulated in the nuclear deal. but instead of calling this violation what it is, the obama administration chose to sweep it under the rug. such passivity in the face of iranian violations only emboldens the regime to see what more it can get away with. this is a dangerous game to play when the consequences are so grave for our national security and that of our close ally israel. the administration's nuclear deal with iran itself contained far too many major concessions: it recognized iran's right to enrichment, despite longstanding united states policy against such recognition, and settled for a weak inspections regime that is anything but ``anytime, anywhere.'' we must act again today to put a stop to the concessions. for that reason, i urge my colleagues to pass this urgent measure. the speaker pro tempore. all time for debate on the bill has expired. amendment no. 1 printed in part a of house report 114-818 offered by mr. huizenga of michigan mr. huizenga of michigan. mr. speaker, i have an amendment at the desk. the speaker pro tempore. the clerk will designate the amendment. the text of the amendment is as follows: page 1, before line 1, insert the following: section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``no u.s. financing for iran act''. page 1, line 7, strike ``that is ordinarily incident to'' and insert ``in connection with''. page 4, after line 3, insert the following: title iii--sunset sec. 301. sunset. this act and the amendment made by this act shall cease to be effective on the date that is 30 days after the date on which the president certifies to congress that the government of iran has ceased providing support for acts of international terrorism. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to house resolution 921, the gentleman from michigan (mr. huizenga) and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from michigan. mr. huizenga of michigan. mr. speaker, at this point my amendment adds a short title and clarifies the nature of prohibited iranian transactions. the amendment also provides for a sunset of the bill's provision upon presidential certification that iran has ceased support of international terrorism. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. heck of washington. mr. speaker, i rise in opposition to this amendment and the underlying bill. the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. mr. heck of washington. the key change made by this amendment is to strike the phrase ``ordinarily incident to'' and insert ``in connection with.'' one is a term of art commonly used by the treasury's office of foreign assets control, or ofac. companies doing business with an ofac license know what that means. in connection with is a much broader term, not clearly defined, mr. speaker, and if this amendment were to pass, exactly how attenuated of a connection would be impermissible? crickets, because we don't know. i believe the chilling effect of this language would go far beyond the purported intent of this legislation. and let there be no confusion what the intent is, which is to block a single legal, fully compliant, and scandal-free business transaction that supports both our national security and american manufacturing. if this bill became law, we would be less safe. the u.s. specifically committed in the joint comprehensive plan of action, or the iran deal, as we refer to it, to allow the sale of commercial aircraft to iran, as well as the provision of associated services. associated services is specifically defined in the relevant section of the agreement to include financial services of the kind u.s. banks would be specifically blocked from providing under this bill. well, it is hard to think of anything that would be a clearer violation of our own commitments under the jcpoa, an action that would give iran a meaningful reason to walk away from the whole thing, making us less safe. it is a clear, black-and-white violation of the jcpoa. and what is our plan b if congress provokes the collapse of this agreement? crickets. we don't have one. think of how much went into the successful negotiation of the agreement. we had to convince a lot of countries, with whom we don't often always agree, to maintain a united front for u.n. sanctions to be effective. if we choose to burn down the jcpoa, which this will do, entirely of our own volition, are my colleagues under any illusion that we could simply go back to our partners, not to mention iran, and say with a straight face: well, let's start over. and why wouldn't iran just happily revel in the unraveling of the mighty international coalition which brought them to the table and go back to building up its nuclear program again? again, crickets, because they would be likely to. so let's be clear. yes, we continue to have numerous and serious differences with iran. but as we counter their destabilizing behavior in other parts of the middle east, i know i sleep better at night knowing that the iran deal prevents them from obtaining a nuclear bomb with which to set off either a regional arms race or threaten our allies with nuclear blackmail. and frankly, if iran is going to get new planes--and nothing in this bill will stop them, the choice is really not whether it is going to be boeing or airbus--i sleep better at night knowing that you have got american eyes on that plane in the form of the after-sale services for parts repair and american hands doing the maintenance to guard against the diversion from legitimate civil aviation use. it keeps us more safe if these are american-made planes. but even if we ignore all the compelling evidence that this bill will make us less safe, this bill fails spectacularly at preventing iran from buying airplanes. in fact, i am certain it would hurt our own aerospace industry way more than it would hurt iran. it is easy for foreign companies to get around this bill. they easily go to non-u.s. banks for financing. but american companies don't have that option to cut out u.s. banks entirely, unless you prefer that the proceeds from a sale be kept offshore, that american workers and communities [[page h6264]] never see a dime of reinvestment, and the more than 100,000 jobs this transaction could support go to other countries. this bill is also an attack on a key pillar of support for our exporters, including the aerospace exporters, namely, the ex-im bank. despite the fact that the ex-im bank already has a policy against this, despite the fact that there is law against this, despite the fact that the ex-im has said they won't do this, and despite the fact that the seller, boeing, has said in writing they won't do this. this isn't belts and suspenders. this is stapling your pants to your flesh. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to reject this bill that undermines foundational elements of our national and economic security, and, in so doing, i too am reminded of what president reagan once said: ``it's not what you don't know that bothers me, it's what you think you know that ain't so.'' mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. huizenga of michigan. mr. speaker, my colleague from washington, who has been a big proponent of the export-import bank and a particular company that he was alluding to and talking about, knows, though, that this bill would apply to any aircraft that the treasury authorizes for iran. that includes the 17 airbus planes for iran air. and he brought up, actually, offshore profits. well, according to bloomberg, boeing has $800 million--$800 million in profits stashed offshore; and the reports are that boeing is pursuing these deals with the japanese bank already, not a u.s. bank. and apparently the company is less worried about this bill and that financing than my friend from washington is. {time} 1900 so this is simply about saying that iran does not have direct access to the u.s. financial system. i don't understand why my friends and colleagues on the other side of the aisle are so freaked out by that. this is simply about making sure that our banking system is not going to finance this deal indirectly or directly and that the use of the export-import bank would be prohibited. this amendment says it is a sunset to this bill upon presidential certification that iran has ceased support of international terrorism-- a goal we all have. so if the president can support that and certify that, then this falls away. so we do not say that this deal is not allowed. we simply say that u.s. financial institutions cannot be used for this and that we cannot and will not use the export-import bank--a u.s. taxpayer-funded entity--to do this. at the end of the day, in april of this past year, secretary jack lew told us that there will be no access; and either he misled the united states citizens and this body at that time or they changed their mind. they haven't told us which, but neither one is acceptable. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to the rule, the previous question is ordered on the bill, as amended, and on the amendment offered by the gentleman from michigan (mr. huizenga). the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from michigan (mr. huizenga). the amendment was agreed to. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. the bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. motion to recommit mr. swalwell of california. mr. speaker, i have a motion to recommit at the desk. the speaker pro tempore. is the gentleman opposed to the bill? mr. swalwell of california. i am opposed in its current form. the speaker pro tempore. the clerk will report the motion to recommit. the clerk read as follows: mr. swalwell of california moves to recommit the bill h.r. 5711 to the committee on financial services with instructions to report the same back to the house forthwith with the following amendment: page 2, after line 2, insert the following new section: sec. 103. protecting u.s. elections. the secretary of the treasury may not authorize a transaction described under section 101 by a u.s. financial institution if such institution is engaged in business with a foreign entity that has been found by the secretary, in consultation with the director of national intelligence, to have engaged in or authorized cyber attacks targeting any election held in the united states. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from california is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion. mr. swalwell of california. mr. speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. if adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended. mr. speaker, this final amendment says plainly that no u.s. business may do business with a country that has used cyber attacks to undermine a u.s. election. so if my colleagues are genuine in believing that iran is a hopeless adversary, then surely they will join me in believing that russia, in its efforts to undermine our recent november election, should also be treated as such. this motion is really about the future of two u.s. adversaries: iran and russia. iran, surely a bad actor over the last few decades, has finally in the last couple of years come to the international table and struck an agreement with the united states and many of our allies to make sure that we take it from being a country that is 3 months away from having a nuclear weapon to 1 year away. they continue to sponsor terrorism across the world. but today, better than ever before, we have eyes, ears, and checks and balances on them that we have never had. by the way, we can address all of their bad behavior with them being much farther away from having a nuclear weapon than they were before the iran nuclear agreement. russia, however, continues to wreak chaos in the middle east supporting syria and its brutal dictator assad. russia brought down a commercial airliner over ukraine and has further incurred into ukraine taking over crimea. russia continues to attack and escalate hostilities with u.s. personnel at our embassy in moscow. now the standard bearer for the republican party, president-elect trump, has chosen to embrace russia and take the united states on a new tack. so the question today is: if you believe iran is hopeless, then do you believe that we should also make sure no u.s. business does business with a country that is trying to undermine our elections? i want to go through some of that evidence. on october 7 of this year, director of national intelligence clapper said that the intelligence community is confident that the russian government directed cyber attacks aimed at disrupting our november elections. why would russia do this? russia clearly had a favored candidate in this race in president- elect trump. russia has been successful. this amendment says that you cannot do business with any country that is trying to influence our elections. this amendment says that if you think iran is a bad actor, then you have to treat iran the same way you treat russia. this amendment says that if you think the u.s. should allow businesses to do business with a country trying to undermine our elections, to undermine the will of our constituents, then you should vote against this amendment. if you are with russia, then you should be against this motion. however, if you believe that we are closer to preventing iran from having a nuclear weapon than we were a year ago, and if you believe that it is better for a u.s. manufacturer to provide commercial airliners to iran and create u.s. jobs and have eyes and ears on what is going on over there, then you should be for this motion. but if you want our elections to be free and fair from outside influence, then vote for this motion. if you want to stand with russia, then you should vote against this motion. so i ask my colleagues on the other side: are you going to embrace the new u.s. foreign policy that your standard bearer has proposed, that we are going to undermine and unravel the agreement that we have struck with iran and march millions of young men and women back into the middle east, an area where we have not had major combat operations finally for the first time [[page h6265]] in 15 years? or do you think that we should treat iran the same way that we are treating russia? so i submit that to my colleagues, and i invite them to maybe engage on that question because that is what this motion is about: do you stand with russia? or do you stand with preventing u.s. businesses from doing business with a country that our intelligence community has said has tried to undermine our elections? mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. huizenga of michigan. mr. speaker, i rise in opposition to the amendment. the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. mr. huizenga of michigan. well, america, you just heard a ridiculous straw-man choice laid out in front of you. mr. speaker, this is not about anything other than selling and financing aircraft sales to iran. that is what this bill is about. this is what this bill should be about. i will point out to my colleague that there are some pretty major kinetic activities--i believe they are called at this point, which means shooting war--happening in mosul and other places where our troops are involved. but at the end of the day, mr. speaker, i want to encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this motion to recommit. i look forward to working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to address concerns that we may have with other foreign governments in the future, and i would request that they vote for the underlying bill, h.r. 5711. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. there was no objection. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion to recommit. the question was taken; and the speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. mr. swalwell of california. mr. speaker, on that i demand the yeas and nays. the yeas and nays were ordered. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to the order of the house of today, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. ____________________",78723

CREC-2016-11-16-pt1-PgH6267,CREC-2016-11-16,114,A PERILOUS MOMENT,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [House] [Pages H6267-H6268] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] A PERILOUS MOMENT The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. Comstock). Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gallego) for 30 minutes. Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, our country is facing a perilous moment. In my district, parents are reassuring frightened children that everything will be all right. That is what parents do. Our job as Members of Congress is to do the best we can to make sure that those reassurances come true. Madam Speaker, I was born and raised in Chicago. In 2000, I voted for the first time in my life. I voted for Barack Obama to serve in this Chamber. While he did not win that election, I was inspired by his message of reform, change, and hope. Throughout his life and career, Barack Obama has always tried to bring people together. [[Page H6268]] Even in a highly polarized and tumultuous time, he has always tried to rise above and bridge those divisions and to be a unifying force for good. This is who Barack Obama is. This is who he was at Harvard Law School. This is who he was as a community organizer in Chicago. This is who he was as a State senator, and as our President. Right now, President Obama is discharging his constitutional obligation to orchestrate an orderly transition of power to a new President. I understand and I respect why, under those circumstances, he has chosen to emphasize a message of national unity. I understand and respect why Hillary Clinton, who, despite the painful knowledge that she received more votes than her opponent, is doing the same. But I feel that I have an obligation at this moment, as do many of my colleagues in this House--I have a duty--to tell the truth about Donald Trump. We cannot treat him like any other politician or like any other Republican because he is not. Trump represents something much more dangerous; and while none of us want this to be the case, we have a duty to treat him like the threat that he is--a threat to our values, a threat to our people, and a threat to our national identity. Donald Trump is 70 years old, and it is unrealistic to expect him to change at this moment in time. Donald Trump is a sexual predator who brags about grabbing women without their consent. To date, he has been accused of sexual assault by nearly a dozen women. Donald Trump is a demagogue. His political mentor was Roy Cohn, Senator Joseph McCarthy's right-hand man. No surprise that Donald Trump burst onto the national conservative scene by peddling a racist birther conspiracy, questioning whether President Obama was even an American. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will remind Members to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President-elect. Mr. GALLEGO. Duly noted. Donald Trump is a bigot. Even Paul Ryan called Donald Trump's words, when attacking a Federal judge of Mexican descent, the ``textbook definition of racism.'' Donald Trump is a liar. Senator Ted Cruz called him a pathological liar who is completely amoral to boot. Most of all, Donald Trump is a con artist. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is again reminded to observe the decorum of the House and reminds Members to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President-elect. Mr. GALLEGO. Duly noted. Next month, Donald Trump is going on trial for fraud related to the fake university that bore his name. A series of exposes in The Washington Post have revealed the systematic misuse of funds at the fake charity he established. In Atlantic City, he enriched himself at the expense of creditors, investors, workers, and suppliers while running multiple casinos into bankruptcy. Every one of us in Congress--every single one of us in Congress-- knows who Donald Trump is. It does not matter what he says today or what he does tomorrow. His whole life and his whole campaign speak to who he is and to what kind of President he will be for our country. We should be horrified because it is horrifying. The man who boasted, I alone will fix this, will fix nothing. He has broken us apart. Millions of Americans are living in fear because he has threatened them--Muslims, Latinos, African Americans, women, the disabled, the LGBT community, and more. Donald Trump will be our next President. We here in Congress must oppose his agenda. We must oppose his efforts to increase his power. Anything that makes Donald Trump more powerful makes him more dangerous. Look at who Donald Trump is. Look at the life he has led. Look at the campaign he ran. No one should be under any illusions. Never more in my lifetime have we needed strong, aggressive, innovative, strategic leadership from the Democratic Party and the progressive movement that fuels it. Donald Trump will not be an ordinary President. Rather than helping him protect the country, we must protect the country from the new President. Madam Speaker, this is unchartered territory. In the days since his election, Trump has attacked the right to protest. He has attacked The New York Times for its critical coverage. He announced that Steve Bannon, a White nationalist racist, will serve as his senior adviser in his White House. He has committed to deporting 2 to 3 million immigrants immediately. His team has threatened legal action against a Senator who criticized him; and on the campaign trail, he threatened to use the regulatory powers of the Federal Government to retaliate against his critics. Despite his promise to drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, he is stacking his transition team with corporate lobbyists. Trump is preparing to install foxes to watch the people's henhouse. Last but by no means least, he has refused to engage in any meaningful financial disclosures or to take any steps to effectively mitigate the conflicts of interest inherent in the President of the United States and also being the head of an opaque network of privately held companies. We don't know who he owes money to, and we don't know who is paying him. He has installed his children and heirs to manage his company even while they serve as top advisers to his transition. Given everything we know about Donald Trump and everything we don't know, I was alarmed by the words of senior leaders from both the progressive and centrist wings of the Democratic Party regarding their openness to working with Donald Trump on infrastructure. Under ordinary circumstances, we would welcome a plan to invest in America's infrastructure even if that plan came from the other side of the aisle--especially if it came from the other side of the aisle. But Donald Trump is not an ordinary politician. He is a con artist. He has refused to give the American people reason to believe that he is not in this to enrich himself. In fact, he has bucked tradition by maintaining his family's interest in a private corporation. Unfortunately, his infrastructure plan is really a privatization scheme. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair again reminds the gentleman to observe the decorum of the House. Members are to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President-elect. Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, duly noted. He is not reaching out. He is reaching his hand into America's pockets, and we must not let him do it. When President Obama took office, even Americans who didn't support him celebrated his election and what he said about our country, and we united in wishing him well. Here in Congress, however, Republicans announced that they would not lift a finger to help him lead our country. As Donald Trump takes office, even Americans who did reluctantly cast their votes for him worry about what his election says about our country. And if we are united, it is our fervent hope that he does not govern the way he has campaigned. Here in Congress, however, we cannot afford to give him the benefit of the doubt. We must not lift a finger to help him scam our country. We must, instead, put every effort into stopping him. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [House] [Pages H6267-H6268] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] A PERILOUS MOMENT The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. Comstock).

and on the campaign trail, he threatened to use the regulatory powers of the federal government to retaliate against his critics. despite his promise to drain the swamp of corruption in washington, he is stacking his transition team with corporate lobbyists. trump is preparing to install foxes to watch the people's henhouse. last but by no means least, he has refused to engage in any meaningful financial disclosures or to take any steps to effectively mitigate the conflicts of interest inherent in the president of the united states and also being the head of an opaque network of privately held companies. we don't know who he owes money to, and we don't know who is paying him. he has installed his children and heirs to manage his company even while they serve as top advisers to his transition. given everything we know about donald trump and everything we don't know, i was alarmed by the words of senior leaders from both the progressive and centrist wings of the democratic party regarding their openness to working with donald trump on infrastructure. under ordinary circumstances, we would welcome a plan to invest in america's infrastructure even if that plan came from the other side of the aisle--especially if it came from the other side of the aisle. but donald trump is not an ordinary politician. he is a con artist. he has refused to give the american people reason to believe that he is not in this to enrich himself. in fact, he has bucked tradition by maintaining his family's interest in a private corporation. unfortunately, his infrastructure plan is really a privatization scheme. the speaker pro tempore. the chair again reminds the gentleman to observe the decorum of the house. members are to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the president-elect. mr. gallego. madam speaker, duly noted. he is not reaching out. he is reaching his hand into america's pockets, and we must not let him do it. when president obama took office, even americans who didn't support him celebrated his election and what he said about our country, and we united in wishing him well. here in congress, however, republicans announced that they would not lift a finger to help him lead our country. as donald trump takes office, even americans who did reluctantly cast their votes for him worry about what his election says about our country. and if we are united, it is our fervent hope that he does not govern the way he has campaigned. here in congress, however, we cannot afford to give him the benefit of the doubt. we must not lift a finger to help him scam our country. we must, instead, put every effort into stopping him. madam speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",8195
CREC-2016-11-16-pt1-PgH6265-3,CREC-2016-11-16,114,"""NONE OF THE ABOVE""--THE CURE FOR WHAT AILS US","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [House] [Pages H6265-H6267] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ""NONE OF THE ABOVE''--THE CURE FOR WHAT AILS US The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Grayson) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Speaker, we have gone through a terrible and traumatic experience in the last year called a U.S. Presidential election. I don't know how many countless people were utterly mortified by this whether or not their chosen candidate won. As it happened, the candidate whom I voted for lost last Tuesday, but I would be foolish if I ignored the fact that people all across America had a miserable, terrible experience with this Presidential election whether or not their candidate won or lost. You ask yourself: How could that be? Why don't we cherish the opportunity to choose our national leader? How is it that we have been sucked into this negative vortex of hatred and vilification called choosing a President of the United States? It seems utterly imponderable. I was watching Saturday Night Live just a couple days before the election, and the not-Hillary actor and the not-Donald actor could agree on only one thing. This is what they said: ``This whole election has been mean. Don't you guys feel gross all the time about this?'' They were speaking to us, not to each other. They were speaking to us, the American people. They are right. It is gross. But the question for us is very simple: Does it really have to be that way? Or could we somehow transform this into what it is supposed to be, an exhilarating jubilee revolving around choosing a leader who will make America a better place? {time} 1915 But you have to understand that we are in a deep, deep hole here. Both major Presidential candidates entered this campaign with deeply negative favorability ratings, so negative they [[Page H6266]] were in double digits. For the past 6 months, it has been a commonplace observation that both candidates were the most unpopular candidates in the history of Presidential polling--about as popular as getting a root canal on your birthday. It has been 13 long years since the Gallup Poll indicated that most people in this country thought that the country was heading in the right direction, 13 years; some Republican leadership, some Democratic leadership, and it all ends up the same way. Most people think the country is heading in the wrong direction. And it has been 13 years, not coincidentally, since the majority of Americans thought that Congress was doing a good job and approved of it. In fact, we reached a nadir during the government shutdown: only 16 percent of the country thought we were heading in the right direction, and only 9 percent of the country thought that Congress was doing a good job. I pointed out at the time, standing exactly where I am standing right now, that, according to recent polling, Congress was literally less popular than dog poop. In one election after another, the voters feel completely ignored. Little or no effort is made to explain to them how their lives might be improved by any candidates running for office. It is all just an ad hominem personality-driven crap-storm. People feel that they are left to choose between the lesser of two evils. Well, take it from me, the choice between two evils is evil. One sort of commonsense observation when you are left with two major candidates, both of whom are overwhelmingly unpopular, is that part of the problem we face is that almost 80 percent of the people who are in America and eligible to vote had no part in choosing the candidates. So maybe it should come as no surprise that we end up in a situation like this. I did an interesting poll just 3 days before the election, a national poll, and let me show you what I found regarding how these candidates, the nominees of their parties, stacked up against other alternative opponents. Let me show you. Let's play fantasy politics for a few minutes. If the matchup had been President Obama versus Donald Trump, President Obama would have won by 2 percent of the vote. If the matchup had been Bill Clinton versus Donald Trump, Bill Clinton would have won with 4 percent of the vote. If the matchup had been Joe Biden, the Vice President, versus Donald Trump, Biden would have won by 8 percent of the vote. And if the matchup had been Bernie Sanders versus Donald Trump, as reported in the Huffington Post recently, Bernie Sanders would have won by 12 percent of the vote. Note one thing: every single alternative candidate performed better than the actual candidate who was the nominee of my party in these matchups. Also note that you can't possibly attribute that only to the negativity of the campaign because, frankly, there have been a few hard knocks over the years against Barack Obama and against Bill Clinton and against Joe Biden and against Bernie Sanders. Let's play some more fantasy politics. Let's look at alternative opponents against Hillary Clinton. Now, bear in mind that, according to the current results, although Hillary Clinton lost the Presidential election, she nevertheless won the popular vote by around 1 percent of the vote, as I speak to you tonight. Let's take a look at what would have happened if she had been pitted against alternative Republican candidates. Hillary Clinton would have lost to Ted Cruz in the popular vote by 4 percent. Hillary Clinton would have lost to George W. Bush by 8 percent. She would have lost to Marco Rubio by 10 percent, Mitt Romney by 12 percent, and she would have lost to the Speaker of this House, Paul Ryan, by 14 percent. Again, note one thing that draws all of these matchups together: the fact that the candidate who actually was the nominee of his party would have done worse against any alternative opponent, and the candidate who would have been the nominee of her party would have done worse against any alternative opponent that was tested here. Let's continue, just for those who are curious. If neither of the candidates had been nominated by their parties, we would have had some interesting matchups. I will just give you three examples here. I told you already that Senator Sanders would have defeated Donald Trump by 12 points. He would have defeated Ted Cruz by 10 points, and he would have defeated Marco Rubio by 4 points. Interesting matchups all. But here is the thing. The fact is that the great majority of Americans had no choice at all in selecting the candidates who we ended up voting for. We might consider it somehow a good thing that 58 million Americans actually voted in the Presidential primaries, until we consider that 191 million Americans did not. Our grievances as a country and our divisions are massive, deep, intractable, and widely shared. That makes me wonder whether we can declare our independence from a system that constantly and perpetually generates unappealing and, frankly, sometimes appalling alternatives. We can't go on like this. You know what I am talking about. As Leonard Cohen said, we all feel like our dog just died. We have to change the way that we do politics in America. Now, I am not suggesting that we choose our leaders like the Athenians did. They chose their leaders by lottery. I am not suggesting that we adopt Jonathan Swift's suggestions, but I agree with him that people are the riches of a nation. And I am not going to suggest sitting it out. I realize the temptation. I have heard so many people say over the years, ``Don't vote; it only encourages them,'' but I think that is wrong. What we need is a better political system that actually manifests itself in a positive way and leads to a choice between candidates whom--imagine--we respect, we admire, we look up to as they engage in a battle of ideas and principles, not a battle of personalities and personal attacks. I am also not going to suggest that the answer would be a third party. If there is one thing that is clear, the two parties we have aren't functioning that well. I am not sure that a third party is likely to make much of a difference. And I don't think that we are likely to see a messiah running for the third party as a Presidential candidate when one we had this year couldn't even tell us what ``a leppo'' was. It is a good thing nobody asked him, ``What's a henway?'' The answer is 4 to 6 pounds. I think what is missing, after giving this a great deal of thought for the past week, is something very simple. We Americans desperately need and deserve the right to reject all of the candidates on the ballot. Now, I realize that that is an unusual notion, but I want you to think about it because I am introducing a bill called the None of the Above Act, whereby, if the last line on the ballot, ``none of the above,'' gets more votes than any candidate does, then ``none of the above'' actually wins. I am not talking about the Nevada version that we already have where the ``none of the above'' vote gets ignored. I am talking about ``none of the above'' winning and forcing a mulligan, a do-over. We make them do it over until they get it right and give us candidates whom we want to vote for, someone who we feel will actually do a good job in leadership and make the country a better place. Now, I want you to know that this is not unprecedented. I want you to know that in Communist Poland, ``none of the above,'' actually crossing the candidate's name off the ballot, which is a version of ``none of the above,'' defeated the Prime Minister in 1989. In 1991, 200 candidates for the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies were defeated the same way. If the end of communism isn't enough to motivate you for favoring this reform, here are some more benefits: First and most importantly, we eliminate the need, the terrible need, to try to choose between the lesser of two evils. Remember the Louisiana Governor's race 25 years ago when we were forced to choose in Louisiana between corrupt Edwin Edwards and racist David Duke? Do you remember the bumper stickers that said, ``Vote for the crook. It's important''? According to a poll at that time, two-thirds of Louisiana voters wished they could have voted for neither, for ``none [[Page H6267]] of the above.'' And they were right. They were right. If primary voters haven't identified the best candidates for the job--not just decent candidates, but actually the best candidates for the job--the general election voters should be able to wave their fingers and say: Uh-uh, no way. I am not going for that until you convince we, the people, that you are the best candidate for the job, and we are going to insist on other choices until we find somebody who is. Now, this will have a wonderful effect, a very important effect, on what we saw drenching us, the tsunami of negative advertising and negative campaigning that we saw on our TV screens and now on our computer screens and even our phones, this incessant drumbeat of negative campaigning. Why? Because both sides will understand that, if you indulge yourself that way, all you are doing is driving down votes below ``none of the above'' and elevating ``none of the above'' above your candidate. Let's replace this terrible malignant notion of vote against him/vote against her with something called vote for me--and here is why. Here is what I will do to improve your life. What am I going to do for you, not what am I going to do to you. Now, in addition to that, I see a big boost in turnout. Last time I checked, which was a few days ago, the total number of votes in the 2016 Presidential election was lower than the total number of votes in the 2012 Presidential election and the 2008 Presidential election and the 2004 Presidential election. As of a few days ago, you had to go all the way back to 2000 to find any national Presidential election where fewer people voted. And here is the really strange thing: back in 2000, we had 40 million fewer Americans. I think there are a lot of people who will show up for the specific purpose of voting for ``none of the above.'' I think we will see a massive increase in turnout if we simply convey to people the right to reject all the candidates, which is exactly how they feel. In addition to that, we will be keeping elected officials on their toes. Ninety percent of the elected officials in this body, the House of Representatives, face uncompetitive races time after time after time. Two-thirds of all the races down the hall in the Senate are uncompetitive. When Members of Congress represent deep red or deep blue districts, they often run unopposed and they win with 100 percent of the so-called vote, which isn't really a vote at all. So knowing that, no matter what kind of district they are--red, blue, purple--no matter whom they represent, they will be facing ``none of the above'' on that ballot will put the fear of God in them. We need to do that. We need to make sure that the comfortable here in this room and down the hall aren't too comfortable, and that even pampered incumbents in gerrymandered districts would have to work diligently to defeat the specter of ``none of the above.'' {time} 1930 Also, we clearly need to defeat the dictatorship of the primary voters. As I indicated before, 58 million American adults voted in the primary elections, and 191 million did not. What was the result of that? People who were deeply dissatisfied with the choices that they had. Let me show you what I mean. Two days before the Presidential election, I asked in a national poll: How do you feel about those Presidential primary elections? How do you feel about them? Almost 52 percent said they were disappointed. Only 48 percent said that they were pleased. Interestingly enough, that sentiment of disappointment was widely shared. Among Democrats, 38 percent said that they were disappointed. Among Republicans, 53 percent said that they were disappointed. Among Independents, who, in many States, didn't even have the legal right to vote to choose a Presidential candidate in either party, 69 percent said that they were disappointed. That explains, in part, why we end up with a terrible Hobson's choice on the ballot. Above all, though, to be able to choose ``none of the above'' on each Federal ballot would show respect for the voters. In my State--the State of Florida--the Constitution of the State begins with these words: ``All political power is inherent with the people.'' If you really believe that in your heart--if you believe that the sovereign in this country, the royalty in this country are the people of the United States, the voters--then how can you possibly explain to them why we wouldn't allow them to reject all of the candidates? This is a practical proposal. I don't know how many people have noticed this, but we have more than 2 months between the election and when the President is sworn in under the 20th Amendment. We have almost 2 months between the election and when the House of Representatives and the Senate are sworn in here in this building. It is not that difficult to put on a new election within 2 months. I know a lot of people who would favor having elections that take place in less than 2 months instead of approaching 2 years. In fact, it would be a blessed relief. Now, I understand that most people who are elected officials would want to fight against this for their own selfish purposes. In fact, one of the liberating elements is the fact that I will be leaving this body in a couple of months. I will be leaving because I was defeated. I will be leaving this body, and that gives me the freedom to be able to do and say what is right and not what is for my own personal benefit. I will point out that many, many, many people across the country believe that term limits are a good thing and that, somehow or another, term limits have been maneuvered through the Florida legislature and the legislatures of many other States. And, of course, term limits limit the terms of elected officials. In the same sense, if term limits can ever be enacted anywhere, that shows that it is possible to actually put a choice on the ballot like ``none of the above'' that doesn't favor any elected official anywhere--ever--but favors, instead, the voters and gives them a right that they should have but that they don't have. In case you are curious, you may wonder what would have happened a week ago last Tuesday if we had had that choice on the ballot. I know, and I would like to show you. According to my poll, 40 percent of the American people would have voted a week ago last Tuesday for ``none of the above.'' If you were to delve further into it, you would see, of those 60 percent, 28 percent would have voted for Hillary Clinton; 27 percent would have voted for Donald Trump; 4 percent would have voted for the third-party candidate put up by the Libertarians; and 1 percent would have voted for the third-party candidate put up by the Green Party. In short, think about what this really means. ``None of the above'' would have won, and we would have had the choice that human dignity suggests we should have--a choice involving new candidates to decide who rules over this Nation of 300 million-plus people and becomes the leader of the free world--a new set of choices, a better set of candidates, and a brighter future. If we simply can't stand the candidates we have got, we need new ones. Isn't that obvious? Think of it as voting with your middle finger. We deserve this choice. As human beings, as Americans--as people who deserve to have full control over our own sovereign fate--we deserve the choice of ``none of the above.'' Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [House] [Pages H6265-H6267] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ""NONE OF THE ABOVE''--THE CURE FOR WHAT AILS US The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Because both sides will understand that, if you indulge yourself that way, all you are doing is driving down votes below ``none of the above'' and elevating ``none of the above'' above your candidate. Let's replace this terrible malignant notion of vote against him/vote against her with something called vote for me--and here is why. Here is what I will do to improve your life. What am I going to do for you, not what am I going to do to you. Now, in addition to that, I see a big boost in turnout. Last time I checked, which was a few days ago, the total number of votes in the 2016 Presidential election was lower than the total number of votes in the 2012 Presidential election and the 2008 Presidential election and the 2004 Presidential election. As of a few days ago, you had to go all the way back to 2000 to find any national Presidential election where fewer people voted. And here is the really strange thing: back in 2000, we had 40 million fewer Americans. I think there are a lot of people who will show up for the specific purpose of voting for ``none of the above.'' I think we will see a massive increase in turnout if we simply convey to people the right to reject all the candidates, which is exactly how they feel. In addition to that, we will be keeping elected officials on their toes. Ninety percent of the elected officials in this body, the House of Representatives, face uncompetitive races time after time after time. Two-thirds of all the races down the hall in the Senate are uncompetitive. When Members of Congress represent deep red or deep blue districts, they often run unopposed and they win with 100 percent of the so-called vote, which isn't really a vote at all. So knowing that, no matter what kind of district they are--red, blue, purple--no matter whom they represent, they will be facing ``none of the above'' on that ballot will put the fear of God in them. We need to do that. We need to make sure that the comfortable here in this room and down the hall aren't too comfortable, and that even pampered incumbents in gerrymandered districts would have to work diligently to defeat the specter of ``none of the above.'' {time} 1930 Also, we clearly need to defeat the dictatorship of the primary voters. As I indicated before, 58 million American adults voted in the primary elections, and 191 million did not. What was the result of that? People who were deeply dissatisfied with the choices that they had. Let me show you what I mean. Two days before the Presidential election, I asked in a national poll: How do you feel about those Presidential primary elections? How do you feel about them? Almost 52 percent said they were disappointed. Only 48 percent said that they were pleased. Interestingly enough, that sentiment of disappointment was widely shared. Among Democrats, 38 percent said that they were disappointed. Among Republicans, 53 percent said that they were disappointed. Among Independents, who, in many States, didn't even have the legal right to vote to choose a Presidential candidate in either party, 69 percent said that they were disappointed. That explains, in part, why we end up with a terrible Hobson's choice on the ballot. Above all, though, to be able to choose ``none of the above'' on each Federal ballot would show respect for the voters. In my State--the State of Florida--the Constitution of the State begins with these words: ``All political power is inherent with the people.'' If you really believe that in your heart--if you believe that the sovereign in this country, the royalty in this country are the people of the United States, the voters--then how can you possibly explain to them why we wouldn't allow them to reject all of the candidates? This is a practical proposal. I don't know how many people have noticed this, but we have more than 2 months between the election and when the President is sworn in under the 20th Amendment. We have almost 2 months between the election and when the House of Representatives and the Senate are sworn in here in this building. It is not that difficult to put on a new election within 2 months. I know a lot of people who would favor having elections that take place in less than 2 months instead of approaching 2 years. In fact, it would be a blessed relief. Now, I understand that most people who are elected officials would want to fight against this for their own selfish purposes. In fact, one of the liberating elements is the fact that I will be leaving this body in a couple of months. I will be leaving because I was defeated. I will be leaving this body, and that gives me the freedom to be able to do and say what is right and not what is for my own personal benefit. I will point out that many, many, many people across the country believe that term limits are a good thing and that, somehow or another, term limits have been maneuvered through the Florida legislature and the legislatures of many other States. And, of course, term limits limit the terms of elected officials. In the same sense, if term limits can ever be enacted anywhere, that shows that it is possible to actually put a choice on the ballot like ``none of the above'' that doesn't favor any elected official anywhere--ever--but favors, instead, the voters and gives them a right that they should have but that they don't have. In case you are curious, you may wonder what would have happened a week ago last Tuesday if we had had that choice on the ballot. I know, and I would like to show you. According to my poll, 40 percent of the American people would have voted a week ago last Tuesday for ``none of the above.'' If you were to delve further into it, you would see, of those 60 percent, 28 percent would have voted for Hillary Clinton; 27 percent would have voted for Donald Trump; 4 percent would have voted for the third-party candidate put up by the Libertarians; and 1 percent would have voted for the third-party candidate put up by the Green Party. In short, think about what this really means. ``None of the above'' would have won, and we would have had the choice that human dignity suggests we should have--a choice involving new candidates to decide who rules over this Nation of 300 million-plus people and becomes the leader of the free world--a new set of choices, a better set of candidates, and a brighter future. If we simply can't stand the candidates we have got, we need new ones. Isn't that obvious? Think of it as voting with your middle finger. We deserve this choice. As human beings, as Americans--as people who deserve to have full control over our own sovereign fate--we deserve the choice of ``none of the above.'' Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [House] [Pages H6265-H6267] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ""NONE OF THE ABOVE''--THE CURE FOR WHAT AILS US The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Grayson) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Speaker, we have gone through a terrible and traumatic experience in the last year called a U.S. Presidential election. I don't know how many countless people were utterly mortified by this whether or not their chosen candidate won. As it happened, the candidate whom I voted for lost last Tuesday, but I would be foolish if I ignored the fact that people all across America had a miserable, terrible experience with this Presidential election whether or not their candidate won or lost. You ask yourself: How could that be? Why don't we cherish the opportunity to choose our national leader? How is it that we have been sucked into this negative vortex of hatred and vilification called choosing a President of the United States? It seems utterly imponderable. I was watching Saturday Night Live just a couple days before the election, and the not-Hillary actor and the not-Donald actor could agree on only one thing. This is what they said: ``This whole election has been mean. Don't you guys feel gross all the time about this?'' They were speaking to us, not to each other. They were speaking to us, the American people. They are right. It is gross. But the question for us is very simple: Does it really have to be that way? Or could we somehow transform this into what it is supposed to be, an exhilarating jubilee revolving around choosing a leader who will make America a better place? {time} 1915 But you have to understand that we are in a deep, deep hole here. Both major Presidential candidates entered this campaign with deeply negative favorability ratings, so negative they [[Page H6266]] were in double digits. For the past 6 months, it has been a commonplace observation that both candidates were the most unpopular candidates in the history of Presidential polling--about as popular as getting a root canal on your birthday. It has been 13 long years since the Gallup Poll indicated that most people in this country thought that the country was heading in the right direction, 13 years; some Republican leadership, some Democratic leadership, and it all ends up the same way. Most people think the country is heading in the wrong direction. And it has been 13 years, not coincidentally, since the majority of Americans thought that Congress was doing a good job and approved of it. In fact, we reached a nadir during the government shutdown: only 16 percent of the country thought we were heading in the right direction, and only 9 percent of the country thought that Congress was doing a good job. I pointed out at the time, standing exactly where I am standing right now, that, according to recent polling, Congress was literally less popular than dog poop. In one election after another, the voters feel completely ignored. Little or no effort is made to explain to them how their lives might be improved by any candidates running for office. It is all just an ad hominem personality-driven crap-storm. People feel that they are left to choose between the lesser of two evils. Well, take it from me, the choice between two evils is evil. One sort of commonsense observation when you are left with two major candidates, both of whom are overwhelmingly unpopular, is that part of the problem we face is that almost 80 percent of the people who are in America and eligible to vote had no part in choosing the candidates. So maybe it should come as no surprise that we end up in a situation like this. I did an interesting poll just 3 days before the election, a national poll, and let me show you what I found regarding how these candidates, the nominees of their parties, stacked up against other alternative opponents. Let me show you. Let's play fantasy politics for a few minutes. If the matchup had been President Obama versus Donald Trump, President Obama would have won by 2 percent of the vote. If the matchup had been Bill Clinton versus Donald Trump, Bill Clinton would have won with 4 percent of the vote. If the matchup had been Joe Biden, the Vice President, versus Donald Trump, Biden would have won by 8 percent of the vote. And if the matchup had been Bernie Sanders versus Donald Trump, as reported in the Huffington Post recently, Bernie Sanders would have won by 12 percent of the vote. Note one thing: every single alternative candidate performed better than the actual candidate who was the nominee of my party in these matchups. Also note that you can't possibly attribute that only to the negativity of the campaign because, frankly, there have been a few hard knocks over the years against Barack Obama and against Bill Clinton and against Joe Biden and against Bernie Sanders. Let's play some more fantasy politics. Let's look at alternative opponents against Hillary Clinton. Now, bear in mind that, according to the current results, although Hillary Clinton lost the Presidential election, she nevertheless won the popular vote by around 1 percent of the vote, as I speak to you tonight. Let's take a look at what would have happened if she had been pitted against alternative Republican candidates. Hillary Clinton would have lost to Ted Cruz in the popular vote by 4 percent. Hillary Clinton would have lost to George W. Bush by 8 percent. She would have lost to Marco Rubio by 10 percent, Mitt Romney by 12 percent, and she would have lost to the Speaker of this House, Paul Ryan, by 14 percent. Again, note one thing that draws all of these matchups together: the fact that the candidate who actually was the nominee of his party would have done worse against any alternative opponent, and the candidate who would have been the nominee of her party would have done worse against any alternative opponent that was tested here. Let's continue, just for those who are curious. If neither of the candidates had been nominated by their parties, we would have had some interesting matchups. I will just give you three examples here. I told you already that Senator Sanders would have defeated Donald Trump by 12 points. He would have defeated Ted Cruz by 10 points, and he would have defeated Marco Rubio by 4 points. Interesting matchups all. But here is the thing. The fact is that the great majority of Americans had no choice at all in selecting the candidates who we ended up voting for. We might consider it somehow a good thing that 58 million Americans actually voted in the Presidential primaries, until we consider that 191 million Americans did not. Our grievances as a country and our divisions are massive, deep, intractable, and widely shared. That makes me wonder whether we can declare our independence from a system that constantly and perpetually generates unappealing and, frankly, sometimes appalling alternatives. We can't go on like this. You know what I am talking about. As Leonard Cohen said, we all feel like our dog just died. We have to change the way that we do politics in America. Now, I am not suggesting that we choose our leaders like the Athenians did. They chose their leaders by lottery. I am not suggesting that we adopt Jonathan Swift's suggestions, but I agree with him that people are the riches of a nation. And I am not going to suggest sitting it out. I realize the temptation. I have heard so many people say over the years, ``Don't vote; it only encourages them,'' but I think that is wrong. What we need is a better political system that actually manifests itself in a positive way and leads to a choice between candidates whom--imagine--we respect, we admire, we look up to as they engage in a battle of ideas and principles, not a battle of personalities and personal attacks. I am also not going to suggest that the answer would be a third party. If there is one thing that is clear, the two parties we have aren't functioning that well. I am not sure that a third party is likely to make much of a difference. And I don't think that we are likely to see a messiah running for the third party as a Presidential candidate when one we had this year couldn't even tell us what ``a leppo'' was. It is a good thing nobody asked him, ``What's a henway?'' The answer is 4 to 6 pounds. I think what is missing, after giving this a great deal of thought for the past week, is something very simple. We Americans desperately need and deserve the right to reject all of the candidates on the ballot. Now, I realize that that is an unusual notion, but I want you to think about it because I am introducing a bill called the None of the Above Act, whereby, if the last line on the ballot, ``none of the above,'' gets more votes than any candidate does, then ``none of the above'' actually wins. I am not talking about the Nevada version that we already have where the ``none of the above'' vote gets ignored. I am talking about ``none of the above'' winning and forcing a mulligan, a do-over. We make them do it over until they get it right and give us candidates whom we want to vote for, someone who we feel will actually do a good job in leadership and make the country a better place. Now, I want you to know that this is not unprecedented. I want you to know that in Communist Poland, ``none of the above,'' actually crossing the candidate's name off the ballot, which is a version of ``none of the above,'' defeated the Prime Minister in 1989. In 1991, 200 candidates for the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies were defeated the same way. If the end of communism isn't enough to motivate you for favoring this reform, here are some more benefits: First and most importantly, we eliminate the need, the terrible need, to try to choose between the lesser of two evils. Remember the Louisiana Governor's race 25 years ago when we were forced to choose in Louisiana between corrupt Edwin Edwards and racist David Duke? Do you remember the bumper stickers that said, ``Vote for the crook. It's important''? According to a poll at that time, two-thirds of Louisiana voters wished they could have voted for neither, for ``none [[Page H6267]] of the above.'' And they were right. They were right. If primary voters haven't identified the best candidates for the job--not just decent candidates, but actually the best candidates for the job--the general election voters should be able to wave their fingers and say: Uh-uh, no way. I am not going for that until you convince we, the people, that you are the best candidate for the job, and we are going to insist on other choices until we find somebody who is. Now, this will have a wonderful effect, a very important effect, on what we saw drenching us, the tsunami of negative advertising and negative campaigning that we saw on our TV screens and now on our computer screens and even our phones, this incessant drumbeat of negative campaigning. Why? Because both sides will understand that, if you indulge yourself that way, all you are doing is driving down votes below ``none of the above'' and elevating ``none of the above'' above your candidate.

said, ``vote for the crook. it's important''? according to a poll at that time, two-thirds of louisiana voters wished they could have voted for neither, for ``none [[page h6267]] of the above.'' and they were right. they were right. if primary voters haven't identified the best candidates for the job--not just decent candidates, but actually the best candidates for the job--the general election voters should be able to wave their fingers and say: uh-uh, no way. i am not going for that until you convince we, the people, that you are the best candidate for the job, and we are going to insist on other choices until we find somebody who is. now, this will have a wonderful effect, a very important effect, on what we saw drenching us, the tsunami of negative advertising and negative campaigning that we saw on our tv screens and now on our computer screens and even our phones, this incessant drumbeat of negative campaigning. why? because both sides will understand that, if you indulge yourself that way, all you are doing is driving down votes below ``none of the above'' and elevating ``none of the above'' above your candidate. let's replace this terrible malignant notion of vote against him/vote against her with something called vote for me--and here is why. here is what i will do to improve your life. what am i going to do for you, not what am i going to do to you. now, in addition to that, i see a big boost in turnout. last time i checked, which was a few days ago, the total number of votes in the 2016 presidential election was lower than the total number of votes in the 2012 presidential election and the 2008 presidential election and the 2004 presidential election. as of a few days ago, you had to go all the way back to 2000 to find any national presidential election where fewer people voted. and here is the really strange thing: back in 2000, we had 40 million fewer americans. i think there are a lot of people who will show up for the specific purpose of voting for ``none of the above.'' i think we will see a massive increase in turnout if we simply convey to people the right to reject all the candidates, which is exactly how they feel. in addition to that, we will be keeping elected officials on their toes. ninety percent of the elected officials in this body, the house of representatives, face uncompetitive races time after time after time. two-thirds of all the races down the hall in the senate are uncompetitive. when members of congress represent deep red or deep blue districts, they often run unopposed and they win with 100 percent of the so-called vote, which isn't really a vote at all. so knowing that, no matter what kind of district they are--red, blue, purple--no matter whom they represent, they will be facing ``none of the above'' on that ballot will put the fear of god in them. we need to do that. we need to make sure that the comfortable here in this room and down the hall aren't too comfortable, and that even pampered incumbents in gerrymandered districts would have to work diligently to defeat the specter of ``none of the above.'' {time} 1930 also, we clearly need to defeat the dictatorship of the primary voters. as i indicated before, 58 million american adults voted in the primary elections, and 191 million did not. what was the result of that? people who were deeply dissatisfied with the choices that they had. let me show you what i mean. two days before the presidential election, i asked in a national poll: how do you feel about those presidential primary elections? how do you feel about them? almost 52 percent said they were disappointed. only 48 percent said that they were pleased. interestingly enough, that sentiment of disappointment was widely shared. among democrats, 38 percent said that they were disappointed. among republicans, 53 percent said that they were disappointed. among independents, who, in many states, didn't even have the legal right to vote to choose a presidential candidate in either party, 69 percent said that they were disappointed. that explains, in part, why we end up with a terrible hobson's choice on the ballot. above all, though, to be able to choose ``none of the above'' on each federal ballot would show respect for the voters. in my state--the state of florida--the constitution of the state begins with these words: ``all political power is inherent with the people.'' if you really believe that in your heart--if you believe that the sovereign in this country, the royalty in this country are the people of the united states, the voters--then how can you possibly explain to them why we wouldn't allow them to reject all of the candidates? this is a practical proposal. i don't know how many people have noticed this, but we have more than 2 months between the election and when the president is sworn in under the 20th amendment. we have almost 2 months between the election and when the house of representatives and the senate are sworn in here in this building. it is not that difficult to put on a new election within 2 months. i know a lot of people who would favor having elections that take place in less than 2 months instead of approaching 2 years. in fact, it would be a blessed relief. now, i understand that most people who are elected officials would want to fight against this for their own selfish purposes. in fact, one of the liberating elements is the fact that i will be leaving this body in a couple of months. i will be leaving because i was defeated. i will be leaving this body, and that gives me the freedom to be able to do and say what is right and not what is for my own personal benefit. i will point out that many, many, many people across the country believe that term limits are a good thing and that, somehow or another, term limits have been maneuvered through the florida legislature and the legislatures of many other states. and, of course, term limits limit the terms of elected officials. in the same sense, if term limits can ever be enacted anywhere, that shows that it is possible to actually put a choice on the ballot like ``none of the above'' that doesn't favor any elected official anywhere--ever--but favors, instead, the voters and gives them a right that they should have but that they don't have. in case you are curious, you may wonder what would have happened a week ago last tuesday if we had had that choice on the ballot. i know, and i would like to show you. according to my poll, 40 percent of the american people would have voted a week ago last tuesday for ``none of the above.'' if you were to delve further into it, you would see, of those 60 percent, 28 percent would have voted for hillary clinton; 27 percent would have voted for donald trump; 4 percent would have voted for the third-party candidate put up by the libertarians; and 1 percent would have voted for the third-party candidate put up by the green party. in short, think about what this really means. ``none of the above'' would have won, and we would have had the choice that human dignity suggests we should have--a choice involving new candidates to decide who rules over this nation of 300 million-plus people and becomes the leader of the free world--a new set of choices, a better set of candidates, and a brighter future. if we simply can't stand the candidates we have got, we need new ones. isn't that obvious? think of it as voting with your middle finger. we deserve this choice. as human beings, as americans--as people who deserve to have full control over our own sovereign fate--we deserve the choice of ``none of the above.'' madam speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",17866

It should be an issue that committees of jurisdiction in this body take a look at. Let's listen to some experts talk about it and find out if the system is working very well. It was set up a long time ago, and maybe it should be changed. So, I think it is something we need to take a look at. It is interesting that just in the last few years--in this century-- we have had two winners of elections that got less votes than the losers. I am sorry. We have two elections this century where the losers got more votes than the winners. So we need to take a look at that, and so I hope something is done on a bipartisan basis because no one knows what is going to happen 4 years from now, 8 years from now, 12 years from now.

Mr. President, there were a number of bright spots on election day, but I have to say, without any question, that the one for us was in Nevada. We scored victories everyplace. The Koch brothers came to the State and publicly said: Reid has been hard on us, and we are going to teach him a lesson. I wasn't born yesterday. I knew. They really didn't frighten me. In spite of all their untold wealth, they could not affect what we had built up over the years in Nevada. We carried the State by about 30,000 votes for Hillary Clinton, which maybe in California it doesn't sound like a lot, but in South Carolina and Nevada it is a lot of votes--30,000 votes. [[Page S6388]] In the Senate seat to replace me, we won by a large margin. We picked up two Democratic House seats. Out of the six Democratic House seats that were picked up in this past election, a third of them came from Nevada. We turned the assembly to a big, big majority. The State senate now has 21 members. It was 11-to-10 Republican. It is now 11-10 Democratic. To make it even better, the day after the election a Republican State senator switched to become an Independent, like Bernie Sanders and Angus King. So there is a two-vote majority there. It was really a good day for Nevada. We rejected the divisive vision of America that some had, but we also enacted some important reforms. In Nevada--the Wild West, NRA members galore--we voted to have background checks. When I went to the State legislature a long time ago, in 1969, as a young assemblyman, I introduced legislation to have a 3-day waiting period before you can buy a gun. That has been longstanding in most of rural Nevada. They eliminated that. But I started being concerned about this a long time ago, and now in Nevada we are going to have background checks for people purchasing guns. That is good. The National Rifle Association spent millions of dollars trying to stop that, but we cared more about keeping guns out of the hands of dangerous people than catering to people with special interests. I mention the NRA. Listen, the National Rifle Association used to be a different organization. After the Columbine horror in Colorado, they came out saying that we should do something for background checks. They have changed. Members of the NRA in Nevada understand that. They are like NRA members all over the country. The majority of NRA members believe there should be background checks and you shouldn't as a criminal be able to buy a gun or you shouldn't be able to buy a gun if you are unstable mentally. We elected the first Latina Senator in the history of the country, Catherine Cortez Masto. We are a diverse State. I am happy that our elected leaders that we brought back here certainly represent that. I have talked about Catherine Cortez Masto. She is going to be a wonderful Senator. I am so proud of her. I have known her family for years. I have admiration for her accomplishments as a prosecutor and attorney general for the State. The Nevada seat was a Koch brothers prize, but they came in second. We also elected Ruben Kihuen. He is a fine man. He is a Mexican immigrant elected to the House of Representatives. He will do a good job, this young man. I have so much admiration for him. The picture on the front page of our papers in Las Vegas was really wonderful. His mom and dad, immigrants themselves, with their boy who is now going to be a Member of Congress. That is pretty dramatic. They came to the United States wanting to live the American dream, and that is what they have done. Serving with Ruben and serving with Catherine in the Congress is a woman by the name of Jacky Rosen. Jacky has been an inspiring community leader for years, working as president of her synagogue. Jacky has no experience in politics--zero. She ran for a seat that is just a tiny bit Democratic, but a very competitive seat. It is a seat that Congressman Heck lost for the Senate and held for three terms. She didn't have a really long resume, other than being a wonderful person who had a great family and was involved in community activities. She was president of her synagogue. She proved to be a tremendously talented candidate, and she will be good here in Washington as a Member of Congress. Dina Titus, a longtime Member of Congress, is returning to the House for a fourth term. She knows Nevada inside and out. She is a longtime member of the State legislature and a professor at UNLV. So I am grateful for these good people who are now going to be Members of the Congress of the United States. Catherine, Ruben, Jacky, and Dina will be great for Nevada and the country. Our Democratic legislature in Nevada will be led by an African American, Aaron Ford. We have an African American leading the State senate. He is the majority leader. He is a wonderful young man who is so talented, well educated. He has a Ph.D. and a law degree. He has it all. Jason Frierson is going to be leading the assembly as speaker. He is just a good person, a good guy with an accomplished record in the State assembly. There has been some talk about ``the Reid machine,'' but, of course, the machine is leaving Washington in a few weeks. But it is not about me. It is about our State and about the progress we have made over the years. The victories we saw last week speak volumes about the talent of the candidates and the people working to make sure these victories happen. Most of the work done in the State was by volunteers. There were thousands of people--thousands of people--out in the streets 2 weeks before the election. On one Saturday, 70,000 doors were knocked on in the small State of Nevada--70,000. Having done door-to-door stuff ourselves, we all know that there were not 70,000 people home, but thousands and thousands of people were reached through that process. As I have mentioned, our State has a crop of incredibly talented leaders to stand up to the Trump administration and hold Republicans accountable. Our new leaders are going to fight for the issues that are important to the people of the State of Nevada, all issues dealing with immigrants. My father-in-law was an immigrant to the United States from Russia. My grandfather was from England. We are going to do everything we can to make sure that people understand the importance of immigration. On Yucca Mountain, they asked me a couple of days ago about the Republicans wanting to revive Yucca Mountain. Well, I know the Presiding Officer and the Republicans are concerned about money. So if the Republicans want to revive Yucca Mountain, bring a great big checkbook because what it is going to cost to revive that is not millions of dollars but billions of dollars--billions. There is nothing there. All the equipment has been junked, ground up. It is where they sell junk and metal. It is gone. What I say is, if the Republicans want to waste money on that, let them do it. Let them do it because it doesn't meet the environmental standards of anyplace, let alone our country. So let them try to revive it. But I say to my Republican friends, make sure you have a lot of money. We are going to do everything together in the next few weeks, and certainly when I am gone, the new Congressional delegation will do everything they can to protect clean energy. We have really done a lot with wind, solar, and geothermal. We need to continue that. In Nevada, 87 percent of the land is owned by the Federal Government. I know that is hard to comprehend. The Presiding Officer is from South Carolina. If you come to one of the beautiful wilderness areas, that land is not mine. That land is not Nevada land. It is your land. It is public land. You have as much right as anyone to enjoy those beautiful mountains that we have. We have 314 mountain ranges. We have a mountain that is 14,000 feet high. We have 32 mountains over 11,000 feet high. These are your mountains, just as they are mine. I say to the Presiding Officer, don't be part of a deal to sell those public lands to the private sector. The States and local governments-- they cannot protect those lands. So for our children and our grandchildren, don't let them mess with public lands. I appreciate the Presiding Officer listening to me. I will close by saying that I am very proud of what happened in the State of Nevada a week ago yesterday. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). The Senator from Florida. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, what is the business before the Senate? ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6387-S6388] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NEVADA ELECTION RESULTS Mr. REID.

The National Rifle Association spent millions of dollars trying to stop that, but we cared more about keeping guns out of the hands of dangerous people than catering to people with special interests. I mention the NRA. Listen, the National Rifle Association used to be a different organization. After the Columbine horror in Colorado, they came out saying that we should do something for background checks. They have changed. Members of the NRA in Nevada understand that. They are like NRA members all over the country. The majority of NRA members believe there should be background checks and you shouldn't as a criminal be able to buy a gun or you shouldn't be able to buy a gun if you are unstable mentally. We elected the first Latina Senator in the history of the country, Catherine Cortez Masto. We are a diverse State. I am happy that our elected leaders that we brought back here certainly represent that. I have talked about Catherine Cortez Masto. She is going to be a wonderful Senator. I am so proud of her. I have known her family for years. I have admiration for her accomplishments as a prosecutor and attorney general for the State. The Nevada seat was a Koch brothers prize, but they came in second. We also elected Ruben Kihuen. He is a fine man. He is a Mexican immigrant elected to the House of Representatives. He will do a good job, this young man. I have so much admiration for him. The picture on the front page of our papers in Las Vegas was really wonderful. His mom and dad, immigrants themselves, with their boy who is now going to be a Member of Congress. That is pretty dramatic. They came to the United States wanting to live the American dream, and that is what they have done. Serving with Ruben and serving with Catherine in the Congress is a woman by the name of Jacky Rosen. Jacky has been an inspiring community leader for years, working as president of her synagogue. Jacky has no experience in politics--zero. She ran for a seat that is just a tiny bit Democratic, but a very competitive seat. It is a seat that Congressman Heck lost for the Senate and held for three terms. She didn't have a really long resume, other than being a wonderful person who had a great family and was involved in community activities. She was president of her synagogue. She proved to be a tremendously talented candidate, and she will be good here in Washington as a Member of Congress. Dina Titus, a longtime Member of Congress, is returning to the House for a fourth term. She knows Nevada inside and out. She is a longtime member of the State legislature and a professor at UNLV. So I am grateful for these good people who are now going to be Members of the Congress of the United States. Catherine, Ruben, Jacky, and Dina will be great for Nevada and the country. Our Democratic legislature in Nevada will be led by an African American, Aaron Ford. We have an African American leading the State senate. He is the majority leader. He is a wonderful young man who is so talented, well educated. He has a Ph.D. and a law degree. He has it all. Jason Frierson is going to be leading the assembly as speaker. He is just a good person, a good guy with an accomplished record in the State assembly. There has been some talk about ``the Reid machine,'' but, of course, the machine is leaving Washington in a few weeks. But it is not about me. It is about our State and about the progress we have made over the years. The victories we saw last week speak volumes about the talent of the candidates and the people working to make sure these victories happen. Most of the work done in the State was by volunteers. There were thousands of people--thousands of people--out in the streets 2 weeks before the election. On one Saturday, 70,000 doors were knocked on in the small State of Nevada--70,000. Having done door-to-door stuff ourselves, we all know that there were not 70,000 people home, but thousands and thousands of people were reached through that process. As I have mentioned, our State has a crop of incredibly talented leaders to stand up to the Trump administration and hold Republicans accountable. Our new leaders are going to fight for the issues that are important to the people of the State of Nevada, all issues dealing with immigrants. My father-in-law was an immigrant to the United States from Russia. My grandfather was from England. We are going to do everything we can to make sure that people understand the importance of immigration. On Yucca Mountain, they asked me a couple of days ago about the Republicans wanting to revive Yucca Mountain. Well, I know the Presiding Officer and the Republicans are concerned about money. So if the Republicans want to revive Yucca Mountain, bring a great big checkbook because what it is going to cost to revive that is not millions of dollars but billions of dollars--billions. There is nothing there. All the equipment has been junked, ground up. It is where they sell junk and metal. It is gone. What I say is, if the Republicans want to waste money on that, let them do it. Let them do it because it doesn't meet the environmental standards of anyplace, let alone our country. So let them try to revive it. But I say to my Republican friends, make sure you have a lot of money. We are going to do everything together in the next few weeks, and certainly when I am gone, the new Congressional delegation will do everything they can to protect clean energy. We have really done a lot with wind, solar, and geothermal. We need to continue that. In Nevada, 87 percent of the land is owned by the Federal Government. I know that is hard to comprehend. The Presiding Officer is from South Carolina. If you come to one of the beautiful wilderness areas, that land is not mine. That land is not Nevada land. It is your land. It is public land. You have as much right as anyone to enjoy those beautiful mountains that we have. We have 314 mountain ranges. We have a mountain that is 14,000 feet high. We have 32 mountains over 11,000 feet high. These are your mountains, just as they are mine. I say to the Presiding Officer, don't be part of a deal to sell those public lands to the private sector. The States and local governments-- they cannot protect those lands. So for our children and our grandchildren, don't let them mess with public lands. I appreciate the Presiding Officer listening to me. I will close by saying that I am very proud of what happened in the State of Nevada a week ago yesterday. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). The Senator from Florida. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, what is the business before the Senate? ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6387-S6388] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NEVADA ELECTION RESULTS Mr. REID. Mr. President, there were a number of bright spots on election day, but I have to say, without any question, that the one for us was in Nevada. We scored victories everyplace. The Koch brothers came to the State and publicly said: Reid has been hard on us, and we are going to teach him a lesson. I wasn't born yesterday. I knew. They really didn't frighten me. In spite of all their untold wealth, they could not affect what we had built up over the years in Nevada. We carried the State by about 30,000 votes for Hillary Clinton, which maybe in California it doesn't sound like a lot, but in South Carolina and Nevada it is a lot of votes--30,000 votes. [[Page S6388]] In the Senate seat to replace me, we won by a large margin. We picked up two Democratic House seats. Out of the six Democratic House seats that were picked up in this past election, a third of them came from Nevada. We turned the assembly to a big, big majority. The State senate now has 21 members. It was 11-to-10 Republican. It is now 11-10 Democratic. To make it even better, the day after the election a Republican State senator switched to become an Independent, like Bernie Sanders and Angus King. So there is a two-vote majority there. It was really a good day for Nevada. We rejected the divisive vision of America that some had, but we also enacted some important reforms. In Nevada--the Wild West, NRA members galore--we voted to have background checks. When I went to the State legislature a long time ago, in 1969, as a young assemblyman, I introduced legislation to have a 3-day waiting period before you can buy a gun. That has been longstanding in most of rural Nevada. They eliminated that. But I started being concerned about this a long time ago, and now in Nevada we are going to have background checks for people purchasing guns. That is good.

Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of the motion to [[Page S6389]] proceed to S. 3110, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 543, S. 3110, a bill to provide for reforms of the administration of the outer Continental Shelf of the United States, to provide for the development of geothermal, solar, and wind energy on public land, and for other purposes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I want to speak on the bill. We are going to have a vote somewhere around midday tomorrow on this bill. This Senator comes to this issue with a long history of drilling for oil off our coast. Ever since I was a young Congressman, I have been fighting to keep oil rigs off Florida's coast. It is especially important at this time, as we have a new administration coming in that took a public position in the election declaring the intent of the President-elect to open up additional areas off the coast to oil drilling. The package that we are going to consider tomorrow is an enhancement of exactly that goal. I want to point out to the Senate why this is not in the interest of our country now. First of all, we are dealing with a law that we passed about 5 or 6 years ago with an acronym of GOMESA, which opened up for the first time oil revenues that came from Federal waters to be shared with the Gulf States. We were doing this primarily in the interests of Louisiana because Louisiana had been hit so hard by Hurricane Katrina, and there was a need to restore a lot of those marshes. This was another way of getting revenue to the State of Louisiana. At the same time that bill was passed, it enhanced a law that we had passed with my former colleague Senator Mel Martinez back in the 2006 timeframe that kept the oil drilling off Florida in the gulf--and kept it off, and it is in law. It is the only place of the Outer Continental Shelf where it is in law that you cannot drill up through the year 2022. I want to point out for the historical record why that is so and why this bill we are considering tomorrow is not in the interest of the country. This area in yellow is the Gulf of Mexico off of Florida. This is Florida, the peninsula, the Keys. This is the gulf coast of Florida. Over here is Pensacola. All of that area in yellow is off limits to drilling until the year 2022. Why? Well, it does not take a rocket scientist to realize what happened to Florida's economy after the Deep Water Horizon oil spill. The oil got as far as Pensacola. The spill was over here off of Louisiana. It got to the beaches of Pensacola, some to Destin, some tar balls to Panama City, until the wind started sending it back the other way. But what happened to Florida's tourism industry on its gulf coast for an entire season? The tourists thought there was oil on our beaches, and tourists did not come for an entire season all the way down to Marco Island, Naples--all of those beautiful sugary white sand beaches, including the beaches of Northwest Florida. They did not come because they thought there was oil there. That did not just affect the airlines and the hotels. It affected the dry cleaners and the restaurants and all of the largest industry in Florida, which is the tourism industry. That is one reason. Another reason is that there are so many of the bays and estuaries along this gulf coast where the critters are hatched that supply the fish stocks for the entire gulf. Of course, there are stocks that are hatched here that migrate out into the other oceans. But there is a third reason. That reason is that all of this area to the east of this line--in other words, 125 miles off Panama City, 235 miles off Tampa Bay, even further off Naples--all of that is the largest testing and training area in the world for the U.S. military. The Department of Defense has issued two letters under the signatures of two Republican Secretaries of Defense saying that any oil-related activities here would be incompatible with our testing and training mission, this being the largest one in the United States. That is why we do not have drilling there. You will hear the proponents of the bill say: Well, we have exempted this part. We have exempted it not only because it is off limits in law, but what they are doing to the rest of the gulf coast is almost doubling the revenue sharing that would go to the States, the Gulf States, thereby giving even more incentive for the State governments to want to have drilling off of their coasts regardless of the U.S. military, regardless of the economic engine of Florida, regardless of the very delicate environment. But there is more. As a matter of fact, the bill before us would offer revenue sharing to States. Mind you, this is drilling in Federal waters. Any revenue would typically go to the Federal Government. As a matter of fact, it is estimated by CBO that it would be a loss of $7 billion to the U.S. Treasury. That would also be available for the States on the Atlantic. Here is Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and on up on the Atlantic coast. I brought this chart to show not only the gulf area off of Florida and the military testing and training ranges, but to look at the military testing and training ranges off the Atlantic coast. If it is incompatible here, are we not going to hear, as we have heard from some in the Department of Defense, that it is going to be incompatible in the Atlantic region? I want to urge that not only have we been battling to keep our coastal environments and beaches clean and unpolluted--that is not the only argument. The argument is also one of keeping our national security tested and trained in the most sophisticated weapons and training for the best military in the world. This Senator is a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. There is a reason that we do not have oil rigs out here. First of all, in the State of Florida, we have Tyndall Air Force Base at Panama City. That is where they are training our pilots on F-22s. At Eglin Air Force Base near Fort Walton Beach, that is where about half of the U.S. Air Force training and the other services--the Navy as well as the Air Force--are training their pilots for the F-35 that is now being cycled in to be the workhorse of our fighters. The U.S. Navy, which will have F-35s but presently has F-18s, will fly a squadron to Key West Naval Air Station. They will be there for a week or two. When they lift off from the runway at Boca Chica Key, in 2 minutes they could be over restricted airspace, not having spent a lot of time and fuel to get to the area of restriction for their testing and training. So the Department of Defense has said: You simply cannot have oil rigs operating in an area where we are testing these very sophisticated weapons systems--and they need a lot of space; from this location down here, this is some 300 miles--as well as the training that goes on. It is not just for the benefit of our military, it is key to our national defense. We have watched the tar balls wash up on the beaches. We have seen the sugary white sands of Pensacola Beach completely black, covered in oil. We saw the harm that was done to not only the local businesses that cater to tourists, such as the hotels, restaurants, and attractions, but to all the ancillary businesses, such as the drycleaners and the real estate firms. To put it into perspective, for our State of Florida, this is a $50 billion industry that oils the engine of our economy. We are talking about generating some $700 million in sales tax revenue for the State, and it helps support more than 450,000 jobs throughout the State. Why would you risk destroying a State's economy as well as our military preparation? It is not as if we don't have other places that we want to produce oil. Think of the oil shale that has been tapped in the Dakotas, in Oklahoma, and in Texas that is not producing at maximum capacity. As Floridians, the images of the hazmat crews in those hazmat suits and the Coast Guard vessels skimming off the water just 6 years ago are emblazoned on our memories. Our fishermen and our businesses certainly haven't forgotten their own losses that amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars. So if the new administration and the oil industry want to have a fight on in issue, well, they certainly have one. This Senator is going to continue to try to keep the oil rigs off the State of Florida with everything I have, for all of the reasons I have stated. [[Page S6390]] When we vote tomorrow, I would commend to our colleagues to beware of all of the effects of almost doubling the revenue for the Gulf Coast States of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, which is at the heart of what is behind this particular bill we are going to vote on, but also beware there are hidden messages in this revenue sharing, and it strikes at the heart of what we have been trying to protect here-- the environment, our economy, and our U.S. military preparedness. I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Bringing People Together Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, as long as no other Senator is asking to be recognized, let me just say that from the perspective of the senior Senator from Florida, I think it is the obligation of those of us who were backing the candidate who did not win the Presidency--as President Obama has said, the President-elect will be the President. It is incumbent upon the rest of us, regardless of party, to reach out and to try to help the new President on behalf of and for the sake of our country. This Senator, who in four decades of public service has always tried to reach out in a bipartisan way and bring people together, to build consensus in order to govern, will continue to do so, and this Senator greets the new administration with that statement. It is important that a statement like that be made, especially in this time where we are so rent asunder, where we are so divided, and where we have come through an election that has been--the only word I can think of is ``ugly.'' Things were said in the ordinary course of conversation in this election that should not have been said. Particularly as we try to heal the wounds of both sides and take back the awful things that were said and create an atmosphere where we can come together for the sake of our country, that is especially important, and this Senator is going to contribute to that. It is my hope that it will be received on all sides and that we will reach out and try to bring people together. I think it is important to say that, particularly at a time where feelings have been hurt and feelings have been so high and so tense. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Working Together Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, we are living in historic times. The 115th Congress will be the first time in a decade that Republicans have held both Chambers of Congress and the White House. Before the George W. Bush administration in the early part of this century, you would have to go back to the Eisenhower administration--I believe it was 1953--to find a comparable time of Republican control. Interestingly, for the history buffs who may be listening, there have actually been 14 times since 1945 when we have had single-party majorities in both Houses and the White House. Eleven of those times have been our Democratic colleagues and three times have been Republicans. So I come back to where I started in saying these are truly historic times. This morning, our Republican conference met to elect our leadership team to serve in the next Congress during this extraordinary time. After gaining the majority 2 years ago, it has been a pleasure to look back and see what we have been able to accomplish even with the President from the opposing party in the White House. Yesterday I mentioned the rewrite of No Child Left Behind, which sent more authority back to the States, parents, and teachers to make education decisions for children in kindergarten through 12th grade. I also mentioned passing a long-term highway bill for 5 years--something we hadn't been able to do for a long time. Those are just two concrete examples of how, working together, we can tackle big, intractable problems. Frankly, nothing happens in the Senate unless it is bipartisan. We also passed some other important legislation, something negotiated by the majority leader in the House at the time, Nancy Pelosi, or Leader Pelosi, and Speaker John Boehner, which was the reform of our Social Security laws in terms of how doctors under Medicare are paid. It is an important item because if doctors are not paid a prevailing fee or competitive fee for their services, they are simply not going to see Medicare patients and seniors are not going to have access to the care they deserve. We passed a bill sanctioning North Korea for its nuclear program and its human rights abuses. We also passed legislation to better support our troops, who fight and put themselves in harm's way to keep us safe every day. I am grateful to our Republican colleagues for voting to continue the direction of progress for the American people by reelecting their current leadership, including the senior Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell. As all of us have, I have had the honor to serve alongside Senator McConnell for several years now, although I have served for the last 4 years as the whip or the right hand of the majority leader when it comes to trying to corral votes and trying to promote our legislative agenda. I found the majority leader to be a wise and steady hand in a town marked by the absence of those virtues, among many. So I am proud to serve with him in the next Congress, as I am with all of our colleagues, and in his case as the majority leader, as his assistant. We also had a chance, having come back together after the election, to talk about the future and to talk about our agenda going forward. Yesterday I pointed out several legislative priorities at the top of the list--policy items we have to get right on behalf of the American people--such as confirming a Supreme Court Justice who will interpret the laws as we write them and as the Constitution is written, rather than as another policymaking branch of government. We have also promised we would repeal and replace ObamaCare, which was a failed experiment--failed because the President, when he promoted it, said: If you like what you have, you can keep it. He said: If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. And he said: An average family of four will see their premiums go down $2,500. None of that has been proven to be true. So it is very important we keep that promise of repealing ObamaCare and then replace it on a step-by-step basis over a transition period with more affordable health care that will preserve the choices in health care through Americans and their families and not Washington, DC. And then there is the matter of legislation. After our Democratic friends lost their 60-vote majority in the Senate and the Republicans flipped the House, providing for a divided government, the one thing that has characterized the Obama administration has been its Executive actions and overregulation. In August, it was reported the President and his administration had issued 600 major regulations with a pricetag of more than $740 billion. If there is one thing I hear from my constituents back in Texas-- small business owners and the like--it is that they are feeling the strangling effect of overregulation, along with the cost of compliance and the uncertainty that goes along with it. So it is no surprise to see that our economy has essentially flatlined and not been growing because none of this is good for the small business owners we are relying upon to create jobs and opportunities, and it is not good for American families looking for those jobs in order to provide for their families and simply put food on the table. So we are eager to roll back those expensive, and in many instances unnecessary, certainly in every instance burdensome regulations so the economy can have some breathing room and begin to grow again. Many of us are interested in addressing tax reform as well. There is bipartisan consensus that our Tax Code is simply too complex and counterproductive. In fact, it is literally a self- [[Page S6391]] inflicted wound when it comes to forcing $2 trillion-plus overseas that American-based companies would like to bring back, but the reason they do not is they would be subject to double taxation, first, in the country where the money has been earned and, secondly, when they bring it back to the United States. Rather than do that, many of them will leave that money overseas. That means that rather than investing in American jobs and American infrastructure, they are literally investing in jobs overseas and in building infrastructure to support their facilities in other countries. That makes no sense whatsoever. So tax reform is high on our agenda. I believe, and I am optimistic, that at a time when everybody understands our Tax Code has simply gotten too complex, too expensive, and too counterproductive, we will be able to make some real progress. Coming from a border State, I can tell you I am delighted to hear President Elect Trump talk about the importance of border security. In a post-9/11 world, it is simply critical we know who is coming into our country and make sure they do so only by legal means. So securing our border is something we need to deal with, and thank goodness there is no shortage of good ideas. Chairman Mike McCaul of the House Homeland Security Committee has a bipartisan bill I think would make great progress along those lines, but obviously we are going to have to have an important discussion among all Members of Congress and the administration about how best to accomplish the goal. We also need to remember our ports of entry are where legitimate trade and travel occur, and we should do nothing to impede that because legitimate trade and travel are very important to our economy. The U.S. economy enjoys about 6 million jobs as a result of trade between the United States and Mexico alone. So I look forward to working with the administration and with our colleagues to make sure we secure our border against illegal immigration, including human trafficking, drug trafficking, and the potential violence that goes along with that, while making sure our legitimate trade and travel at our ports of entry are supported so we can benefit from those as well. Of course, as we debated earlier this Congress, having an updated and efficient infrastructure is vital to the health and well-being of our economy. I mentioned the Transportation bill we passed. A long-term Transportation bill will provide for some of that, but certainly not all that is necessary. We need to take a look at the proposals the President-elect is going to send our way, but there is no shortage of good ideas being discussed both in the House and the Senate as well. I look forward to learning more about those, but one thing that hasn't been talked about very much is how we are going to pay for it, and that is going to be an important item to discuss as well. Frankly, we can't keep spending our kids' and grandkids' inheritance or at least forcing upon the younger generations the obligation to pay for bills we incur today. One of the things I hope will occur as a result of this historic election is that we will have the courage and the willingness to sit down and come up with structural solutions to our financial situation, which is $19 trillion-plus in debt. Because of the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates very low, we are not having to pay huge amounts of money in order to service that debt or pay interest to the people who own that debt, but that is going to change if the Federal Reserve begins to raise interest rates, and we are going to find ourselves paying more and more money to service that debt to the bondholders and less and less of that money will be available for our priorities domestically, whether they be national security or other investments in things such as medical research and the like. So finding out how we can crack that nut and come together on a bipartisan basis, working with the White House to deal with our long- term fiscal problems and continuing to meet the needs of our Nation are going to be challenging but exhilarating to do. Many are talking about the next steps and what should and shouldn't happen in light of the new political reality, but what is clear to me today is that Republicans are united by a strong desire to listen to the concerns of the American people and to deliver results--results that make their lives easier and our collective futures stronger. I want to say that as committed as the majority party is to that, we can't do this without the cooperation and consensus building that comes along as part of the legislative process. Unfortunately, we have seen the last years characterized by obstruction and filibusters and blocking things that essentially have already received bipartisan support. I am talking particularly about the appropriations process. One of the terrible things that happened this last year in the Congress is the Appropriations Committees have gotten back to work on a bipartisan basis. We would see bills coming out at a fiscally responsible level, with agreed-upon spending caps and Democrats and Republicans supporting them, only to see them dead on arrival on the floor of the Senate. That is the kind of mindless obstructionism I hope we can avoid going forward. Just from the conversations I have had as a result of this election, many of our Democratic colleagues appear to be willing to work with us. Certainly, with the new leadership on the Democratic side of the aisle, I am more optimistic than I have been in a long time that we can come together while maintaining our strongly held convictions and principles--I am not talking about compromising those but rather working together when we can--and try to develop more ideas to better serve the American people. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 3110, the American Energy and Conservation Act of 2016. This would increase revenue-sharing with the States for offshore oil and gas development. This legislation is scheduled for a vote on the Senate floor tomorrow. I am pleased the Senate is finally voting on this critical legislation, and I thank my colleague from Louisiana, Senator Cassidy, for his lead and his hard work on this crucial issue. Senator Cassidy and I and several of our colleagues have worked hard over the years to bring this issue to the forefront and help both Congress and the American people understand how important revenue-sharing is not only to Louisiana, to other energy-producing States, but to the country and for the good of the country to expand American energy. I also thank Leader McConnell and Chairman Murkowski for working with us to bring this important bill to the floor for a vote. Revenue sharing with oil- and gas-producing States is only fair, for two key reasons: First, energy-producing States incur real costs and real impacts from that production, including environmental, and second, revenue sharing is the most important way we can continue to incent domestic energy production over the long term in this country. It makes it fair and smart for our U.S. energy future. Energy production is essential to job creation and an overall healthy economy. If it weren't for the oil and gas jobs that accompanied the energy sector boom earlier this decade, we would perhaps still be in a technical recession. One point I want to emphasize is that many of those jobs have been created by small firms in the oil and gas sector and support sectors. These small business energy jobs are something I have highlighted in my role as chair of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, and they are vital in terms of the impact in this sector. This legislation would increase revenue sharing for the Gulf States that produce energy offshore and would establish revenue sharing for new production off of Alaska and off of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. These are all areas that welcome the opportunity to have this revenue sharing to incent domestic energy production and increase the availability of American energy. [[Page S6392]] Contrary to what some have said, this legislation would not authorize any new offshore drilling. Let me repeat. This legislation does not provide for new or expanded lease sales. This bill is about revenue sharing. Let me be clear on what revenue sharing means for a State like Louisiana, but there are many more. In Louisiana, we spend 100 percent of these revenues on environmental concerns--specifically coastal restoration. We lose about a football field worth of land in coastal Louisiana--just think of the football field you see every Sunday in an NFL game; that amount of land just in coastal Louisiana--every 38 minutes. That is 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 52 weeks a year, no time off for weekends, holidays, nothing. It is a constant loss. It is an environmental disaster. That is the most significant environmental issue by far that we face in our State. Our State is committed to spending all of the money we receive from revenue sharing to restore, rebuild, and protect our coast. That is vitally important for Louisiana, but it is also vitally important for the rest of the country because Louisiana supplies so much energy that is good for America. Let me be clear on what this legislation does. It expands revenue sharing to Alaska and the Mid-Atlantic States, so it has impacts well beyond the gulf in a very positive way. Beginning in 2027, Alaska, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia would begin receiving 37.5 percent revenue sharing from oil and gas production off of their coasts, which is what Louisiana, Texas, Alabama, and Mississippi receive on new production there. It would also increase revenue sharing that those Gulf States receive under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006, or GOMESA. Under that law, revenue sharing in those four Gulf States is capped at $500 million per year between all of them, but beginning in 2027, that cap would increase substantially. That cap right now is completely arbitrary and far too low. Revenue sharing is vital when it comes to adequately compensating States that help provide so much U.S. energy. It needs to be adequate if we are going to continue to incent those States to play that very important role in our U.S. economy. This legislation would help bring that objective to reality, and it is a critical component of a robust, strengthened revenue sharing regime for those major energy-producing States. I urge my colleagues to pass this important legislation. Again, I thank everyone who has worked on this, starting with my colleague from Louisiana, Senator Cassidy, who will be speaking on this topic immediately following me. With that, I welcome the Senator's remarks. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana. Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Vitter for his support, his kind words, and his tireless effort over his senatorial career to highlight the fact that Louisiana is losing so much land and there is something we need to do about it. I also thank Majority Leader McConnell for following through on his commitment to allow a vote on the American Energy and Conservation Act of 2016. This was introduced earlier this year by Senators Murkowski, Scott, Vitter, Tillis, Sullivan, and me. I thank each of them for their hard work. I also thank Senators Kaine and Warner for helping draft the Atlantic portion of the legislation and for cosponsoring an earlier version. As I just said, this is a bipartisan piece of legislation that uses an ``all of the above'' strategy to pursue true American energy independence. More than anything else, though, this legislation is about creating better jobs with better benefits. If there was one message we heard from this past election--if we actually listened to the American people, if we heard what they were saying, what we heard is that they want jobs that work for them, better jobs with better benefits. This helps accomplish that. For example, a study conducted by Quest Offshore Resources, Inc., projects that this legislation would incentivize the creation of 280,000 new jobs by 2035. That same study estimates $195 billion in new investments and an additional $51 billion in cumulative government revenue. That is $51 billion in new Federal revenue that this bill helps unlock. It goes a long way to addressing our debt, deficit, and obligation to future generations. The American Energy and Conservation Act will benefit American families and small businesses by expanding opportunities for States-- not just gulf coast but elsewhere--to support energy development. For years, energy activities in coastal Gulf States and adjacent offshore waters have produced billions of barrels of oil and trillions of cubic feet of natural gas for American families. These States support offshore energy development for the rest of the country and provide the support and pay for the infrastructure needed to bring this energy to market. As with all development, there are increased costs associated with supporting increased traffic, additional use of local and State resources, as well as transportation corridors such as pipelines, vessels, and trucks to get this energy delivered to consumers across the United States. This bill is truly an ``all of the above'' energy jobs bill. This legislation includes language introduced by Senators Heller, Heinrich, Risch, and Tester that streamlines the process for developing the renewable energy on public lands while establishing the first-ever revenue sharing paradigm for renewables. This legislation incentivizes tapping into the 27,000 megawatts of carbon-free energy that the Bureau of Land Management estimates could be provided by these projects. Furthermore, if offshore revenue exists for oil and gas development, the same should be true for offshore wind development. That is why we are using the same model established in GOMESA to extend revenue sharing to States that support offshore wind projects. This legislation thus incentivizes developing some of the 4,233 gigawatts of carbon-free generation that the Bureau of Land Management estimates is available for development off our coasts. This is the American Energy and Conservation Act of 2016. This legislation makes significant investments in conservation projects all over the United States. This legislation provides an additional $807 million for projects that increase access to public lands for hunting, fishing, and other outdoor recreational activities. This particular provision was included in Senator Murkowski's Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act of 2015, which 24 Senators have cosponsored. The legislation makes investments in a variety of important programs, including the Payment in Lieu of Taxes Program. This legislation is supported by over 50 important stakeholder groups, including the National Association of Manufacturers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American Chemistry Council, the American Petroleum Institute, and the Consumer Energy Alliance. These organizations understand that this legislation is a jobs builder and good policy for American workers. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, the American Energy and Conservation Act of 2016. I yield back. Mr. VITTER. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Remembering Jack Shatford Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, my Arkansan of the week is Jack Shatford, and the recognition is both honorary and, sadly, posthumous. Jack passed away last month during one of his many hunting trips to Arkansas. He loved our State and its people, and we all miss him badly. Jack first got to know Arkansas on the other side of the world in Vietnam. Jack and my dad Len served together in the same infantry squad in Vietnam in 1969 and 1970. They became closest of friends, a friendship that only grew over nearly a half century. Jack was from Missouri, so he and Dad were able to see each other regularly, often on deer-hunting trips in [[Page S6393]] Arkansas and duck- and goose-hunting trips in Missouri. He became like the brother my dad never had, a second son to my grandparents and Aunt Pood. Jack also got to know my mom Avis, just as my mom and dad got to know Jack's wife Joy. Over time, my sister and I came along and Jack and Joy became like an aunt and uncle to us, just like my parents felt about Kurt, Jack and Joy's son. Some of my oldest memories are traveling to Missouri to see the Shatfords at places like Six Flags, Silver Dollar City, and Branson and seeing how happy and excited my dad was in the days leading up to Jack's visits to Arkansas. Jack was a lifelong hunter and outdoorsman. He worked for 34 years at the Missouri Department of Conservation. If it flew, ran, or swam, you can pretty much bet that Jack knew how to find it, track it, kill it, and cook it. In fact, I have to confess that Jack probably put more meat on the Cotton family table than my dad ever did. He taught me a lot of lessons as well, not just about the outdoors but about life. Jack helped me see some things through my dad's eyes, and I figure he probably did the same thing for my dad. Their example from Vietnam contributed to my decision to join the Army. That wasn't an easy time in the Cotton household, believe me, but Jack was there to help smooth things over, and he encouraged me all along the way. Jack was a patriot. He had put his life on the line to defend the country we love so much. I know from my dad's war stories that Jack was fearless and brave, but he was also gentle and outgoing, the kind of guy who makes fast friends. He sure made a lot of friends in Dardanelle where he was like an adopted son. He even belonged to our Yell County Wildlife Federation. Above all, though, Jack was a loving family man, a devoted husband to Joy, and father to Kurt and his wife Mary, and Jack was a doting grandpa to Sarah and Shelby. They will miss Jack as we all miss him so dearly. The pain hasn't gone away yet. It will not for a while, and it may never go away, but with the pain, we ought to be swelled with pride and gratitude to have known and loved such a fine man. Jack Shatford, rest in peace and follow me. FUNDING OUR MILITARY Mr. President, the world may be more unstable than ever. The security architecture we built after World War II is at risk. Our parents and grandparents fought to keep the world free from a conflict between major powers. They created order out of the chaos of world war and genocide. They protected our freedom and ensured that our democratic ideals would be the dominant power in the world. The foundation of that order is the U.S. military. Since they toppled Nazi Germany and imperial Japan, they held firm against the North Korean assault on the democratic South. They faced down a powerful Soviet Union through decades of Cold War. They liberated Kuwait and have shed blood and sweat for over a decade, keeping America safe from Islamic terrorism. Today our military is composed solely of volunteers. We don't press our people into service. They choose to serve. Since the draft was abolished, we have had a basic compact with our men and women in uniform. In exchange for their service, we ensure that they have the best training, equipment, and leadership America has to offer. We make certain that if our troops must face the enemy, they are equipped to meet the task. With regret, I must say this compact is fraying and we are failing in our duty to our military. Today the Armed Forces face a growing number of threats and a shrinking budget. Russia is resurgent. They don't think they lost the Cold War, only that they were behind at halftime. Russia's invasion and occupation of Ukraine and Georgia make it clear that Moscow seeks to dominate its so-called near abroad. Moscow wants to divide the great Atlantic Alliance, viewing the confederation of democracies as a threat to the power and authority of a Putin government. Their bombers probe our airspace in ways unseen since the Cold War. They recently sent a carrier fleet through the English Channel. They probe our electronic defenses with daily cyber attacks and rattle the sabre of their nuclear arsenal at the West. China has also risen. They have sought to establish military control over the East and South China Seas. China also probes and attacks American servers, stealing vital military and industrial secrets. China has quadrupled its defense spending in the past few years, seeking control of the Pacific Rim. North Korea is growing a nuclear arsenal and developing the capability to hit any American city with those nuclear bombs. Iran continues to violate the terms of its nuclear agreement and is the world's worst state sponsor of terrorism. Just last month, Iranian- backed rebels fired Chinese anti-ship missiles at an American warship. Had it not been for the skill of the crew and our modern defenses, sailors may have come home in boxes. In Afghanistan, we lost 15 servicemembers in 2016. They continue to fight daily, protecting Americans from the threat of a resurgent terrorist threat. How do we repay their service? We have cut their budget by over $1 trillion. We have told them to do more with less. We have ignored their needs, long and repeated deployments, and brutal operations tempo. We have cut their pay, forced them to sail on rickety ships, and told them to fly on aircraft so old they date back to the Truman and Eisenhower administrations. This neglect has taken its toll. In January, 12 Marines died in a helicopter crash. Low readiness and subpar flying hours were to blame. Last week, six Green Berets were killed in 72 hours. They died in three separate incidents, stretching from the continental United States to Jordan, to Afghanistan. The Air Force is 4,000 airmen short of what is needed to maintain their fleet, and they are 700 pilots short to fly that fleet. They are salvaging parts from scrap yards to keep their aircraft flying. Since May, five F-18 Hornets and Super Hornets have crashed, killing two pilots and destroying all five jets. In the Army, just 30 percent of brigade combat teams are properly trained and equipped to fight. The Navy has had to defer maintenance for combat ships, leaving them more dangerous for the crews. We are wrong to ask our military to work and risk their lives under these conditions, and we cannot wait until the next fiscal year to fix this crisis because this is a crisis. This is no way to treat our troops and the military needs relief now. I will soon introduce a $26 billion emergency spending request, a lifeline to our overworked warfighters. The funds will be used to address immediate needs in military readiness and overseas operations. They will give our warfighters critical relief in these trying times. They will help keep our men and women in uniform safe as we ask them to do an increasingly dangerous job. I ask my colleagues to put aside old debates and do what is right for our Armed Forces. They are the ones risking their lives daily, not us. They are the ones out on the front lines defending our country, not us. They are the ones begging for help, and we are the ones obligated to provide it. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so ordered. Working Together Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it has been the great privilege and honor of my life to represent the people of Arizona in the Senate. I am humbled that in last Tuesday's election they placed their trust in me for another term. Since I first came to this body, I have never taken that trust for granted, and I never will. I will get up every day for the next 6 years determined to work harder than the day before for the people of Arizona. Of course, mine was not the only election last Tuesday. The American people did their civic duty and chose a [[Page S6394]] new President. I congratulate the President-elect. My prayers are with him and his family as he prepares to assume our Nation's highest office, and I will do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges confronting our Nation. This was a long and difficult national election and not always an uplifting one. I know there were many Americans who were disappointed on election night, and we have seen some of that disappointment in the protests that have taken place in several cities across the Nation. Some of those protesters have even taken to using the slogan ``Not my President.'' This is misguided. I have been on the losing side of elections before, and it is no fun. But America has only one President at a time. We do not have to agree with the President on every issue, and when we do disagree, we should express ourselves in the spirit of mutual respect that is essential for a free and democratic people. Therefore, I urge all Americans to offer our next President good will and an earnest effort to find ways to come together to make necessary compromises to grow our economy, defend our security, and leave future generations a stronger, better America. That better America is one in which we never forget that whatever our differences, we are all Americans. We must respect our common citizenship by treating each other with respect. That is why I have been so disturbed by reports of increased acts of intimidation, harassment, and even violence directed at minority, racial, and religious groups in the aftermath of this election. Prejudice and hate have no place in America. Such behavior is a betrayal of who we are as a people and all that we aspire to be. To those who have committed these disgusting acts, I repeat the words of the President-elect: Stop it. With the campaign over, it is time for all of us to go about the work the American people sent us here to do, and there is a lot of work to do. For too long, Washington has schemed, fought, and maneuvered to gain political advantage at the cost of delivering for the American people. The predictable result is that we have made little, if any, progress toward meeting the great challenges of our time and too many Americans feel left out and left behind. This election made clear that Americans are fed up with business as usual in Washington, and they want us to make progress now on solving national problems that threaten their ability to prosper and make a better life for their families. They want progress now on growing the economy and increasing their opportunities to live purposeful and satisfying lives. They want progress now to secure their families and America's interests from the dangerous threats we face overseas. As chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, America's national security and the men and women in uniform who protect it will be my top priorities. We have to put an end to business as usual at the Pentagon, where the largest government agency cannot pass a financial audit and where a broken acquisitions system is too often plagued by cost overruns, schedule delays, and poor performance. We have to put an end to sequestration once and for all and return to a strategy-based defense budget. It gives our servicemembers the resources, training, and equipment they need to meet current and future threats. We have to accelerate the defeat of ISIL in Iraq and Syria and continue to take the fight to radical Islamist terrorists who seek to attack our homeland. Above all, we must remain the free world's leader and stand up always and everywhere for the values that make us exceptional and to which all people are entitled: the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We have to reinvigorate America's alliances around the world, not discard them in favor of cynical deals with adversaries who want us to relinquish our global leadership. We have to enhance shared efforts to deter and, if necessary, defeat aggression from whatever power threatens our interests and values. Achieving these goals will require a team at the Department of Defense composed of the best people our Nation has to offer. The Senate Armed Services Committee stands ready to receive nominations from the new President. The stakes for our Nation are high. So too must be our standards. America has many challenges ahead, but none of us should despair of our present difficulties. Instead, we must believe always in the promise and greatness of America. I still do. In that spirit, my promise is this: to work as hard as I ever have; to use all my knowledge, experience, and relationships; and to work with our new President and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to solve our problems together as fellow Americans. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Congratulating the Chicago Cubs on Winning the World Series Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I rise to offer congratulations to the 2016 World Series champion Chicago Cubs, who are being congratulated in a resolution that I did with my colleague Senator Durbin. For 100 years, it seemed fitting that we would overcome the daunting three games to one to win the series. Many times I have said that any team can have a bad century, like 108 years. One of the most painful moments we have had as Cubs fans is watching the 1969 Cubs when we always knew we were going to beat the amazing Mets. I remember the names: the late Ron Santo, the late Ernie Banks, Fergie Jenkins, and Billy Williams. They were up nine games on the Mets but collapsed at the end of the season. In 2016, the Cubs blew away the 1969 record and went all the way. They removed the curse of the billy goat and the black cat. That toughness exemplifies the can-do spirit of the people of Illinois. No one deserves this championship more than the best baseball fans in the country, the Cubs fans. I also want to give a real shout-out to World Series MVP Ben Zobrist. Following the victory, I had the honor of riding in the victory parade. Over 5 million Chicagoans came to watch. I understand from the press that this was the seventh largest gathering in human history. Congratulations to the 2016 World Series champion Chicago Cubs. I want to send my thank you to Tom Ricketts, Theo Epstein, and Joe Maddon, the players, the fans, and everyone involved in making this the most unforgettable Cubs season. I yield back. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. RELIGIOUS FREEDOM Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, 1 year ago I came to the Senate floor for a series of eight speeches on a subject central to the identity and character of our country's religious freedom. As Congress unanimously declared less than two decades ago, religious freedom undergirds the very origin and existence of the United States. In that series of remarks, I started with the first principles to establish why religious freedom matters and must be given special protection. I reviewed the central role of religious freedom and the central role that religious freedom has played in shaping our country beginning long before independence. I have an example of how I phrased it on this chart. From the earliest settlers to the revolutionary generation, to the 19th century, to the modern day, religious freedom has been a driving force in American life. Without the quest for religious liberty, there would be no United States, and without the continued guarantee of religious freedom, there can be no American ideal. I also outlined the substance and status of religious freedom in America. In other words, I answered the questions of what religious freedom is and how important it is. From the pen of James Madison to the words of the First Amendment, from statutes to international treaties, religious freedom has [[Page S6395]] always been understood to include both belief and behavior in public and in private, collectively and individually. The status of the importance of religious freedom can be summed up in two words used repeatedly by America's Founders and leaders from the beginning: Religious freedom is both inalienable and preeminent. In last year's series of speeches, I also described the ways our government institutions are increasingly undermining religious freedom. These attacks come from, of course, the executive branch and even State legislatures, and they occur because our leaders have forgotten, ignored, or never really learned the fundamentals of religious freedom. A philosopher, George Santayana, wrote that ``those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.'' Put another way, as President Andrew Jackson warned as he left office, ``Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.'' ``You must pay the price,'' Jackson said, ``if you wish to secure the blessing.'' Unfortunately, we are no longer paying the price necessary to maintain this fundamental right. Either by negligence or intention, political forces in our society are radically changing what has been the very heart and soul of our great country. They want to restrict the substance of religious freedom so that it includes belief but not behavior; in private but not in public; individually but not collectively. They want to demote the status of religious freedom from inalienable and preeminent to optional and secondary. Examples abound in just the last several years. When the Obama administration and Democrats in Congress fashioned ObamaCare, for instance, they gave no thought to the law's impact on religious freedom. This is especially shocking given that Federal law required them to do so. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act sets a high standard for government actions that burden religious freedom and explicitly requires that Federal laws and regulations meet that standard. The Obama administration and congressional Democrats, however, ran roughshod over religious freedom in fashioning mandates and policies that force people to violate their deeply held religious beliefs. The Supreme Court has twice held that the birth control mandate in ObamaCare is incompatible with the protections for religious freedom that Congress previously and nearly unanimously enacted. Another example is before us today. Two years ago, President Obama issued a sweeping Executive order prohibiting Federal contractors and grant recipients from taking into account sexual orientation or gender identity when making employment decisions. The order itself is not a surprise. President Obama has been a supporter of LGBT rights throughout his Presidency and believes that gays and lesbians deserve the same job opportunities as everyone else. On that latter point, I-- along with most Americans--agree. What was remarkable about President Obama's order was that it contained no exemption for employers with religious affiliations. For years, laws prohibiting discrimination in employment and housing have routinely included religious liberty exemptions to protect religious organizations from having to take actions that contravene their beliefs. Such exemptions, for example, permit a religiously affiliated school that holds traditional views on marriage and human sexuality to offer married housing only to couples of the opposite sex or decline to hire as a faculty member an individual in a committed, same-sex relationship. These exemptions enable religious organizations to hold true to their beliefs while still complying with the law. President Obama's decision not to include a religious liberty exemption in his Executive order marked a sharp turn in the wrong direction. One year earlier, Senate Democrats had agreed to include a robust religious exemption in the Employment Nondiscrimination Act, or ENDA, a bill that would have prohibited sexual orientation discrimination in hiring by employers with at least 15 employees. ENDA's exemption tracked similar provisions in numerous State laws, including Utah's. Notwithstanding requests from religious groups, President Obama refused to include a similar exemption in his Executive order. His refusal means that a religious organization that wishes to compete for Federal funds may be forced to hire individuals who hold views or engage in conduct that contravenes the organization's religious beliefs. This is a direct attack on the ability of such organizations to preserve and promote their religious identity. Earlier this year, the House of Representatives took action to reverse the President's troubling refusal to protect religious employers. Back in May, the House passed the annual National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, to fund the Armed Forces. At the markup on the bill, Representative Steve Russell of Oklahoma offered, and the committee adopted, an amendment to the bill to clarify that religious organizations that contract with or receive grants from the Federal Government do not lose religious liberty. They do not lose religious liberty protections that they enjoy under other laws merely because they choose to work with the Federal Government. These protections, which are found in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Americans with Disabilities Act, include the ability to hire ``individuals of a particular religion to perform work connected with the [organization's] activities'' and to ``require that all applicants and employees conform to the [organization's] religious tenets.'' Such protections enable religious organizations to preserve their religious identity by hiring employees who share the organization's religious beliefs. Now, the Russell amendment affirms that religious organizations and schools enjoy these same protections when they contract with or receive grants from the Federal Government. The amendment embodies the commonsense, longstanding principle that religious organizations should not have to surrender control over their religious mission in order to interact with government. Unfortunately, there has been a lot of misinformation spread about the Russell amendment and what it does and does not do so let me take a moment to clear it up. Some have claimed the amendment would allow contractors to deny service to gays or lesbians or would enable any contractor who so wishes to make hiring decisions on the basis of religious beliefs. It would do no such thing. The amendment is limited only to hiring and employment practices and only to religiously affiliated corporations, associations, educational institutions, or societies, in conformance with the existing protections in the Civil Rights Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. The amendment clarifies that religious organizations do not lose religious liberty protections merely because they enter into contract with or receive grants from the Federal Government. That is it. We might think that a position reaffirming existing religious liberty protections would not raise eyebrows. Unfortunately, we would be wrong. President Obama swiftly expressed his opposition to the Russell amendment. Not only that, but he threatened to veto the entire NDAA, cutting off funding for the entire Department of Defense rather than allow the amendment to take effect. President Obama would rather shutter our Armed Forces than enable religious employers to select employees who share their particular values. Regrettably, the President has been joined in his opposition by 42 Senate Democrats who recently wrote a letter to the President outlining their ``strong opposition'' to the Russell amendment and asking the President to ``ensure that [the amendment] is removed from the final version of [the NDAA].'' The President and my Democratic colleagues are concerned, it seems, that if religious organizations that contract with the Federal Government are able to select employees who share the organization's religious beliefs, they may make decisions that liberals would disapprove of. For example, a religious family services charity may choose to hire individuals who hold traditional views on marriage and human sexuality. Because the President and my colleagues across the aisle do not share these views, they think religious organizations should be unable to take them into account when [[Page S6396]] seeking employees who will promote the organization's mission. It is difficult to imagine a position more at odds with our heritage of religious freedom. President Obama and Senate Democrats would empower the Federal Government to compel religious organizations to hire individuals who do not share the organization's religious beliefs. They would insert Federal tentacles into fundamental decisions regarding religious mission and identity. They would have the Federal Government declare off-limits traditional views on sexual orientation and gender identity that many Americans hold as a matter of religious conviction. But there is an even more pernicious aspect to the Democrats' position on this issue. Many liberals argue that claims of religious liberty are nothing more than a front for discrimination. They contend--with some force--that religious liberty claimants just don't like gay people or don't like women and use religion as a cover for their deep-seated animus toward disfavored groups. That is, of course, ridiculous. I would challenge anyone who holds this view to actually interact with a religious person. They will find, contrary to their own prejudices, that people of faith are loving, gracious, and polite and, more often than not, go out of their way to help the poor and the downtrodden. Religious believers don't treat others with kindness and charity despite their faith; they do so because of their faith. To my liberal friends, I say: Before you tar religious believers with whatever benighted stereotypes you see portrayed on TV and in the news media, get to know some of them. You will find your assumptions about them are totally wrong. Nevertheless, many liberals claim that religious liberty is a guise for discrimination. There is no reason, they say, for a religious organization or individual to seek an exemption from an otherwise equitable law, other than animus toward those the law is designed to protect. But what, then, are we to make of President Obama's Executive order and the left's reaction to the Russell amendment? President Obama could have included a religious liberty exemption in his order--such exemptions are standard in other laws, and numerous religious groups asked him to include one here--but he chose not to. Senate Democrats could easily have agreed to the Russell amendment, which does nothing more than reaffirm existing protections for religious employers--but they chose not to do so. What reason is there to exclude religious contractors and grant recipients from religious liberty protections that are otherwise generally available? Why single out such contractors and grant recipients for disfavor? It makes you wonder. Do my Democratic colleagues not see that the very argument they make against religious liberty can be turned against them? They are seeking to withdraw from religious contractors and grant recipients rights and protections that would otherwise be available under existing law. They are undermining the ability of believers to navigate between secular and spiritual demands. They are bringing to bear the sword of the State when they could easily stay their hand. It is difficult for me to look at the President's actions and those of my colleagues across the aisle and see anything other than discrimination against people of faith. They could give room for believers--as our Nation has done for centuries--but they choose not to. Rather, they cut and nip at religious liberty until all that remains is a hollow shell. I am left to wonder when the drive for equality became the drive to exclude and to undermine religion because that seems to be where we have arrived. Give a place for us, say people of faith. Allow us to live out our beliefs. We will abide the law, but we ask you to make reasonable accommodations. Surely a simple religious liberty exemption--indeed, one that is already part of our existing laws--would be reasonable. I close with an appeal to my Democratic colleagues. The outcome of the fight over the Russell amendment is not in doubt. Even if President Obama vetoes the NDAA or the Russell amendment is removed during conference, President Obama's Executive order will be withdrawn or else amended by the President-elect to include a religious liberty exemption. The Russell amendment will become law whether it is through congressional action or Executive order. The question for my colleagues across the aisle is whether they will stand up for the rights of religious contractors and grant recipients or whether they will join President Obama's losing battle against religious liberty. Will they protect people of faith or will they prosecute them? President Obama has cast his lot with the prosecution. It is not too late for my Democratic colleagues to choose a different course, and I hope and pray they will. These are not itty-bitty issues. These are issues that go right back to the core values of our country and our beliefs. Religious liberty is not something that can be cast aside. It is not something that should be cast aside. Religious liberty is a fundamental right, and we should not be playing around with it in the Congress. When there is prejudice and there is discrimination, that is another matter, but in virtually every case of religious liberty, I don't find that prejudice or discrimination. Our churches are a vibrant part of America, and we sure as heck ought to stand behind them and make sure religious liberty is always protected. I hope my colleagues will think these things through, I hope the 42 Democrats who voted to remove the Russell amendment will change their minds, and I hope they start to realize that religious freedom is not some itty-bitty thing. It is the thing in many respects that has been part of making America the greatest land in the world and the freest land in the world and the place where liberty includes real liberty. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I appear to be on the floor for Utah Day, with the junior Senator presiding and the senior Senator speaking. I am delighted to follow the senior Senator. I think in the boisterous days and months we will see ahead, his longstanding reputation for collegiality and reason and the respect in which his colleagues all hold him could become valuable attributes in our Senate. Climate Change Mr. President, I am here as the Senate reconvenes from the 2016 election recess to give my 149th climate speech, but I want first to congratulate my colleagues who were reelected and the new Members elected to the Senate and President-Elect Trump and Vice President- Elect Pence. With control of the White House and majorities coming in the House and the Senate, Republicans will wield great power in Washington, DC, and as the well-known saying goes, ``with great power comes great responsibility.'' In his acceptance speech, President-Elect Trump asked us all for help and guidance in governing this great Nation. My guidance would be first to be responsible. A key test will be whether our President-elect and Republicans here in the Senate choose to be responsible about climate change. I am gravely concerned about climate change, but based on the President-elect's campaign, he appears blissfully unconcerned, and Congress has been stalled by a decades-long industry-controlled campaign of calculated misinformation on the danger of carbon pollution and by just raw industry political pressure. But the President-elect will soon hear--and, hopefully, take it to heart--from a grownup world outside the creepy alt-right and the fossil fuel industry, a world of people who actually know what they are talking about. The President-elect will hear from our military and national security experts how deadly serious this is. Our former Pacific commander, Admiral Locklear, said it was the biggest national security threat we face in the Pacific theater. To use Admiral Locklear's exact words, ``climate change is probably the most likely thing that is going to happen . . . that will cripple the security environment, probably more likely than the other scenarios we all often talk about.'' Geoffrey Kemp, former Special Assistant to the President for National [[Page S6397]] Security Affairs under President Ronald Reagan, said: Our military and intelligence leadership have recognized, under both the George W. Bush and the Obama administrations, that climate change will present real and costly risks to our national security and that the effects are going to get worse if we don't do something about it very soon. As General Douglas MacArthur warned about the dangers of unpreparedness for war, we don't want to be too late. The President-elect will hear from our National Labs and from NOAA and NASA, the folks who put a rover on Mars and are driving it around and may know a little bit about real science, about the robust scientific consensus on climate change, and the urgency to change our course. If he doesn't trust our own scientific agencies, he can go to any major university in any State in the Nation and confirm what the government and military experts tell him. The President-elect will hear from world leaders who have pledged, alongside the United States, to work across borders to limit carbon emissions. The Paris Agreement brought nearly 200 countries together with the common goal of keeping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius and avoiding the most catastrophic outcomes for the planet and its people. He will also hear from CEOs across America, particularly those in the food and agriculture sectors who are living with climate change consequences every day, and from many others that we need to quit fooling around. I hope the President-elect will listen to these voices of reason and expertise. The people in our Nation certainly are listening. Polls show over 60 percent of Americans are concerned about global warming, and more than 80 percent of Americans favor action to reduce carbon pollution. Rhode Island, the Ocean State, would tell the administration that the oceans are the frontlines of climate change. The oceans have absorbed approximately 30 percent of the excess carbon dioxide that we have added to the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution--30 percent of it. They have also absorbed roughly 90 percent of the excess heat trapped in the atmosphere by those greenhouse gases. Without the oceans to absorb that added heat and carbon dioxide, we would not be worried about the 2-degree warming limit the world community is racing to avoid. We would be looking at a 30-degree increase, and life as our species knows it on this planet would be over. Oceans have spared us thus far from disaster, but what they have done to buffer our self-inflicted harm comes at its own cost. Global ocean temperatures are rising. In Rhode Island, Narragansett Bay's mean water temperature is up nearly 4 degrees Fahrenheit. Our Rhode Island lobster fishery is crashing, and our winter flounder fishery is gone. As water warms, of course, it also expands, and as glaciers melt, they add to the volume of the ocean. That is why sea levels are rising worldwide. The water is up about 10 inches at the Newport Naval Station tide gauge since the 1930s, and the Navy is actively planning how to defend the Norfolk Naval Station from rising seas. The effect of the ocean's absorbing all that carbon dioxide is a little different. It causes a chemical reaction. It is making ocean water more acidic. The ocean is acidifying and doing so at the fastest rate in 50 million years. Considering we have only been on the planet as a species for about 200,000 years, that is a long, long interval. Rhode Island's clammers, lobstermen, and aquaculture growers are watching with real alarm the damage acidified seas are doing. On America's northwest coast, oyster hatcheries have already experienced significant losses when their new hatches were unable to grow their shells in the acidified seawater. Off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and Northern California, 50 percent of ocean pteropods were measured to have ``severe shell damage,'' mostly from acidified seas. If that species collapses, the bottom falls out of the oceanic food chain. As the oceans go, so goes the planet. It is my sincere hope that President-Elect Trump will feel the call of history, of reason, and of patriotism to live up to the awesome responsibilities he now will bear. The 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, the so-called COP-22, is now taking place in Marrakech, Morocco. A similar gathering took place in Copenhagen 7 years ago. A full-page ad in the New York Times then called for passage of climate legislation in the United States for investment in the clean energy economy and for leadership to inspire the rest of the world to join the fight against climate change. It said: We must embrace the challenge today to ensure that future generations are left with a safe planet and a strong economy. . . . We support your effort-- They said to President Obama-- to ensure meaningful and effective measures to control climate change, an immediate challenge facing the United States and the world today. Please don't postpone the earth. If we fail to act now, it is scientifically irrefutable that there will be catastrophic and irreversible consequences for humanity and our planet. That full-page ad from which we took this was signed by Donald J. Trump, Chairman and President of the Trump organization. The signatories also included his children, Donald Jr., Eric, and Ivanka. Their future and their reputations are at stake too. The President-elect campaigned against big special interests controlling Washington, and he mocked Republican politicians groveling before the Koch brothers at their ``begathon,'' as he called it. He has a simple choice now. He can make his own decisions based on the best recommendations of our military, our national science laboratories, and our great universities, or he can fall in tow to the Koch brothers--the biggest special interest of them all. He can believe our National Labs and our National Aeronautics and Space Administration, or he can believe the National Enquirer. He can believe our military or he can believe the fossil fuel industry's denial apparatus. He can believe established scientific principles or he can believe fanciful conspiracy theories. His choice will be fateful, and the world and history will both be watching. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6388-S6397] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] AMERICAN ENERGY AND CONSERVATION ACT OF 2016--MOTION TO PROCEED The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of the motion to [[Page S6389]] proceed to S. 3110, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 543, S. 3110, a bill to provide for reforms of the administration of the outer Continental Shelf of the United States, to provide for the development of geothermal, solar, and wind energy on public land, and for other purposes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I want to speak on the bill. We are going to have a vote somewhere around midday tomorrow on this bill. This Senator comes to this issue with a long history of drilling for oil off our coast. Ever since I was a young Congressman, I have been fighting to keep oil rigs off Florida's coast. It is especially important at this time, as we have a new administration coming in that took a public position in the election declaring the intent of the President-elect to open up additional areas off the coast to oil drilling. The package that we are going to consider tomorrow is an enhancement of exactly that goal. I want to point out to the Senate why this is not in the interest of our country now. First of all, we are dealing with a law that we passed about 5 or 6 years ago with an acronym of GOMESA, which opened up for the first time oil revenues that came from Federal waters to be shared with the Gulf States. We were doing this primarily in the interests of Louisiana because Louisiana had been hit so hard by Hurricane Katrina, and there was a need to restore a lot of those marshes. This was another way of getting revenue to the State of Louisiana. At the same time that bill was passed, it enhanced a law that we had passed with my former colleague Senator Mel Martinez back in the 2006 timeframe that kept the oil drilling off Florida in the gulf--and kept it off, and it is in law. It is the only place of the Outer Continental Shelf where it is in law that you cannot drill up through the year 2022. I want to point out for the historical record why that is so and why this bill we are considering tomorrow is not in the interest of the country. This area in yellow is the Gulf of Mexico off of Florida. This is Florida, the peninsula, the Keys. This is the gulf coast of Florida. Over here is Pensacola. All of that area in yellow is off limits to drilling until the year 2022. Why? Well, it does not take a rocket scientist to realize what happened to Florida's economy after the Deep Water Horizon oil spill. The oil got as far as Pensacola. The spill was over here off of Louisiana. It got to the beaches of Pensacola, some to Destin, some tar balls to Panama City, until the wind started sending it back the other way. But what happened to Florida's tourism industry on its gulf coast for an entire season? The tourists thought there was oil on our beaches, and tourists did not come for an entire season all the way down to Marco Island, Naples--all of those beautiful sugary white sand beaches, including the beaches of Northwest Florida. They did not come because they thought there was oil there. That did not just affect the airlines and the hotels. It affected the dry cleaners and the restaurants and all of the largest industry in Florida, which is the tourism industry. That is one reason. Another reason is that there are so many of the bays and estuaries along this gulf coast where the critters are hatched that supply the fish stocks for the entire gulf. Of course, there are stocks that are hatched here that migrate out into the other oceans. But there is a third reason. That reason is that all of this area to the east of this line--in other words, 125 miles off Panama City, 235 miles off Tampa Bay, even further off Naples--all of that is the largest testing and training area in the world for the U.S. military. The Department of Defense has issued two letters under the signatures of two Republican Secretaries of Defense saying that any oil-related activities here would be incompatible with our testing and training mission, this being the largest one in the United States. That is why we do not have drilling there. You will hear the proponents of the bill say: Well, we have exempted this part. We have exempted it not only because it is off limits in law, but what they are doing to the rest of the gulf coast is almost doubling the revenue sharing that would go to the States, the Gulf States, thereby giving even more incentive for the State governments to want to have drilling off of their coasts regardless of the U.S. military, regardless of the economic engine of Florida, regardless of the very delicate environment. But there is more. As a matter of fact, the bill before us would offer revenue sharing to States. Mind you, this is drilling in Federal waters. Any revenue would typically go to the Federal Government. As a matter of fact, it is estimated by CBO that it would be a loss of $7 billion to the U.S. Treasury. That would also be available for the States on the Atlantic. Here is Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and on up on the Atlantic coast. I brought this chart to show not only the gulf area off of Florida and the military testing and training ranges, but to look at the military testing and training ranges off the Atlantic coast. If it is incompatible here, are we not going to hear, as we have heard from some in the Department of Defense, that it is going to be incompatible in the Atlantic region? I want to urge that not only have we been battling to keep our coastal environments and beaches clean and unpolluted--that is not the only argument. The argument is also one of keeping our national security tested and trained in the most sophisticated weapons and training for the best military in the world. This Senator is a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. There is a reason that we do not have oil rigs out here. First of all, in the State of Florida, we have Tyndall Air Force Base at Panama City. That is where they are training our pilots on F-22s. At Eglin Air Force Base near Fort Walton Beach, that is where about half of the U.S. Air Force training and the other services--the Navy as well as the Air Force--are training their pilots for the F-35 that is now being cycled in to be the workhorse of our fighters. The U.S. Navy, which will have F-35s but presently has F-18s, will fly a squadron to Key West Naval Air Station. They will be there for a week or two. When they lift off from the runway at Boca Chica Key, in 2 minutes they could be over restricted airspace, not having spent a lot of time and fuel to get to the area of restriction for their testing and training. So the Department of Defense has said: You simply cannot have oil rigs operating in an area where we are testing these very sophisticated weapons systems--and they need a lot of space; from this location down here, this is some 300 miles--as well as the training that goes on. It is not just for the benefit of our military, it is key to our national defense. We have watched the tar balls wash up on the beaches. We have seen the sugary white sands of Pensacola Beach completely black, covered in oil. We saw the harm that was done to not only the local businesses that cater to tourists, such as the hotels, restaurants, and attractions, but to all the ancillary businesses, such as the drycleaners and the real estate firms. To put it into perspective, for our State of Florida, this is a $50 billion industry that oils the engine of our economy. We are talking about generating some $700 million in sales tax revenue for the State, and it helps support more than 450,000 jobs throughout the State. Why would you risk destroying a State's economy as well as our military preparation? It is not as if we don't have other places that we want to produce oil. Think of the oil shale that has been tapped in the Dakotas, in Oklahoma, and in Texas that is not producing at maximum capacity. As Floridians, the images of the hazmat crews in those hazmat suits and the Coast Guard vessels skimming off the water just 6 years ago are emblazoned on our memories. Our fishermen and our businesses certainly haven't forgotten their own losses that amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars. So if the new administration and the oil industry want to have a fight on in issue, well, they certainly have one. This Senator is going to continue to try to keep the oil rigs off the State of Florida with everything I have, for all of the reasons I have stated. [[Page S6390]] When we vote tomorrow, I would commend to our colleagues to beware of all of the effects of almost doubling the revenue for the Gulf Coast States of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, which is at the heart of what is behind this particular bill we are going to vote on, but also beware there are hidden messages in this revenue sharing, and it strikes at the heart of what we have been trying to protect here-- the environment, our economy, and our U.S. military preparedness. I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Bringing People Together Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, as long as no other Senator is asking to be recognized, let me just say that from the perspective of the senior Senator from Florida, I think it is the obligation of those of us who were backing the candidate who did not win the Presidency--as President Obama has said, the President-elect will be the President. It is incumbent upon the rest of us, regardless of party, to reach out and to try to help the new President on behalf of and for the sake of our country. This Senator, who in four decades of public service has always tried to reach out in a bipartisan way and bring people together, to build consensus in order to govern, will continue to do so, and this Senator greets the new administration with that statement. It is important that a statement like that be made, especially in this time where we are so rent asunder, where we are so divided, and where we have come through an election that has been--the only word I can think of is ``ugly.'' Things were said in the ordinary course of conversation in this election that should not have been said. Particularly as we try to heal the wounds of both sides and take back the awful things that were said and create an atmosphere where we can come together for the sake of our country, that is especially important, and this Senator is going to contribute to that. It is my hope that it will be received on all sides and that we will reach out and try to bring people together. I think it is important to say that, particularly at a time where feelings have been hurt and feelings have been so high and so tense. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Working Together Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, we are living in historic times. The 115th Congress will be the first time in a decade that Republicans have held both Chambers of Congress and the White House. Before the George W. Bush administration in the early part of this century, you would have to go back to the Eisenhower administration--I believe it was 1953--to find a comparable time of Republican control. Interestingly, for the history buffs who may be listening, there have actually been 14 times since 1945 when we have had single-party majorities in both Houses and the White House. Eleven of those times have been our Democratic colleagues and three times have been Republicans. So I come back to where I started in saying these are truly historic times. This morning, our Republican conference met to elect our leadership team to serve in the next Congress during this extraordinary time. After gaining the majority 2 years ago, it has been a pleasure to look back and see what we have been able to accomplish even with the President from the opposing party in the White House. Yesterday I mentioned the rewrite of No Child Left Behind, which sent more authority back to the States, parents, and teachers to make education decisions for children in kindergarten through 12th grade. I also mentioned passing a long-term highway bill for 5 years--something we hadn't been able to do for a long time. Those are just two concrete examples of how, working together, we can tackle big, intractable problems. Frankly, nothing happens in the Senate unless it is bipartisan. We also passed some other important legislation, something negotiated by the majority leader in the House at the time, Nancy Pelosi, or Leader Pelosi, and Speaker John Boehner, which was the reform of our Social Security laws in terms of how doctors under Medicare are paid. It is an important item because if doctors are not paid a prevailing fee or competitive fee for their services, they are simply not going to see Medicare patients and seniors are not going to have access to the care they deserve. We passed a bill sanctioning North Korea for its nuclear program and its human rights abuses. We also passed legislation to better support our troops, who fight and put themselves in harm's way to keep us safe every day. I am grateful to our Republican colleagues for voting to continue the direction of progress for the American people by reelecting their current leadership, including the senior Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell. As all of us have, I have had the honor to serve alongside Senator McConnell for several years now, although I have served for the last 4 years as the whip or the right hand of the majority leader when it comes to trying to corral votes and trying to promote our legislative agenda. I found the majority leader to be a wise and steady hand in a town marked by the absence of those virtues, among many. So I am proud to serve with him in the next Congress, as I am with all of our colleagues, and in his case as the majority leader, as his assistant. We also had a chance, having come back together after the election, to talk about the future and to talk about our agenda going forward. Yesterday I pointed out several legislative priorities at the top of the list--policy items we have to get right on behalf of the American people--such as confirming a Supreme Court Justice who will interpret the laws as we write them and as the Constitution is written, rather than as another policymaking branch of government. We have also promised we would repeal and replace ObamaCare, which was a failed experiment--failed because the President, when he promoted it, said: If you like what you have, you can keep it. He said: If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. And he said: An average family of four will see their premiums go down $2,500. None of that has been proven to be true. So it is very important we keep that promise of repealing ObamaCare and then replace it on a step-by-step basis over a transition period with more affordable health care that will preserve the choices in health care through Americans and their families and not Washington, DC. And then there is the matter of legislation. After our Democratic friends lost their 60-vote majority in the Senate and the Republicans flipped the House, providing for a divided government, the one thing that has characterized the Obama administration has been its Executive actions and overregulation. In August, it was reported the President and his administration had issued 600 major regulations with a pricetag of more than $740 billion. If there is one thing I hear from my constituents back in Texas-- small business owners and the like--it is that they are feeling the strangling effect of overregulation, along with the cost of compliance and the uncertainty that goes along with it. So it is no surprise to see that our economy has essentially flatlined and not been growing because none of this is good for the small business owners we are relying upon to create jobs and opportunities, and it is not good for American families looking for those jobs in order to provide for their families and simply put food on the table. So we are eager to roll back those expensive, and in many instances unnecessary, certainly in every instance burdensome regulations so the economy can have some breathing room and begin to grow again. Many of us are interested in addressing tax reform as well. There is bipartisan consensus that our Tax Code is simply too complex and counterproductive. In fact, it is literally a self- [[Page S6391]] inflicted wound when it comes to forcing $2 trillion-plus overseas that American-based companies would like to bring back, but the reason they do not is they would be subject to double taxation, first, in the country where the money has been earned and, secondly, when they bring it back to the United States. Rather than do that, many of them will leave that money overseas. That means that rather than investing in American jobs and American infrastructure, they are literally investing in jobs overseas and in building infrastructure to support their facilities in other countries. That makes no sense whatsoever. So tax reform is high on our agenda. I believe, and I am optimistic, that at a time when everybody understands our Tax Code has simply gotten too complex, too expensive, and too counterproductive, we will be able to make some real progress. Coming from a border State, I can tell you I am delighted to hear President Elect Trump talk about the importance of border security. In a post-9/11 world, it is simply critical we know who is coming into our country and make sure they do so only by legal means. So securing our border is something we need to deal with, and thank goodness there is no shortage of good ideas. Chairman Mike McCaul of the House Homeland Security Committee has a bipartisan bill I think would make great progress along those lines, but obviously we are going to have to have an important discussion among all Members of Congress and the administration about how best to accomplish the goal. We also need to remember our ports of entry are where legitimate trade and travel occur, and we should do nothing to impede that because legitimate trade and travel are very important to our economy. The U.S. economy enjoys about 6 million jobs as a result of trade between the United States and Mexico alone. So I look forward to working with the administration and with our colleagues to make sure we secure our border against illegal immigration, including human trafficking, drug trafficking, and the potential violence that goes along with that, while making sure our legitimate trade and travel at our ports of entry are supported so we can benefit from those as well. Of course, as we debated earlier this Congress, having an updated and efficient infrastructure is vital to the health and well-being of our economy. I mentioned the Transportation bill we passed. A long-term Transportation bill will provide for some of that, but certainly not all that is necessary. We need to take a look at the proposals the President-elect is going to send our way, but there is no shortage of good ideas being discussed both in the House and the Senate as well. I look forward to learning more about those, but one thing that hasn't been talked about very much is how we are going to pay for it, and that is going to be an important item to discuss as well. Frankly, we can't keep spending our kids' and grandkids' inheritance or at least forcing upon the younger generations the obligation to pay for bills we incur today. One of the things I hope will occur as a result of this historic election is that we will have the courage and the willingness to sit down and come up with structural solutions to our financial situation, which is $19 trillion-plus in debt. Because of the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates very low, we are not having to pay huge amounts of money in order to service that debt or pay interest to the people who own that debt, but that is going to change if the Federal Reserve begins to raise interest rates, and we are going to find ourselves paying more and more money to service that debt to the bondholders and less and less of that money will be available for our priorities domestically, whether they be national security or other investments in things such as medical research and the like. So finding out how we can crack that nut and come together on a bipartisan basis, working with the White House to deal with our long- term fiscal problems and continuing to meet the needs of our Nation are going to be challenging but exhilarating to do. Many are talking about the next steps and what should and shouldn't happen in light of the new political reality, but what is clear to me today is that Republicans are united by a strong desire to listen to the concerns of the American people and to deliver results--results that make their lives easier and our collective futures stronger. I want to say that as committed as the majority party is to that, we can't do this without the cooperation and consensus building that comes along as part of the legislative process. Unfortunately, we have seen the last years characterized by obstruction and filibusters and blocking things that essentially have already received bipartisan support. I am talking particularly about the appropriations process. One of the terrible things that happened this last year in the Congress is the Appropriations Committees have gotten back to work on a bipartisan basis. We would see bills coming out at a fiscally responsible level, with agreed-upon spending caps and Democrats and Republicans supporting them, only to see them dead on arrival on the floor of the Senate. That is the kind of mindless obstructionism I hope we can avoid going forward. Just from the conversations I have had as a result of this election, many of our Democratic colleagues appear to be willing to work with us. Certainly, with the new leadership on the Democratic side of the aisle, I am more optimistic than I have been in a long time that we can come together while maintaining our strongly held convictions and principles--I am not talking about compromising those but rather working together when we can--and try to develop more ideas to better serve the American people. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 3110, the American Energy and Conservation Act of 2016. This would increase revenue-sharing with the States for offshore oil and gas development. This legislation is scheduled for a vote on the Senate floor tomorrow. I am pleased the Senate is finally voting on this critical legislation, and I thank my colleague from Louisiana, Senator Cassidy, for his lead and his hard work on this crucial issue. Senator Cassidy and I and several of our colleagues have worked hard over the years to bring this issue to the forefront and help both Congress and the American people understand how important revenue-sharing is not only to Louisiana, to other energy-producing States, but to the country and for the good of the country to expand American energy. I also thank Leader McConnell and Chairman Murkowski for working with us to bring this important bill to the floor for a vote. Revenue sharing with oil- and gas-producing States is only fair, for two key reasons: First, energy-producing States incur real costs and real impacts from that production, including environmental, and second, revenue sharing is the most important way we can continue to incent domestic energy production over the long term in this country. It makes it fair and smart for our U.S. energy future. Energy production is essential to job creation and an overall healthy economy. If it weren't for the oil and gas jobs that accompanied the energy sector boom earlier this decade, we would perhaps still be in a technical recession. One point I want to emphasize is that many of those jobs have been created by small firms in the oil and gas sector and support sectors. These small business energy jobs are something I have highlighted in my role as chair of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, and they are vital in terms of the impact in this sector. This legislation would increase revenue sharing for the Gulf States that produce energy offshore and would establish revenue sharing for new production off of Alaska and off of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. These are all areas that welcome the opportunity to have this revenue sharing to incent domestic energy production and increase the availability of American energy. [[Page S6392]] Contrary to what some have said, this legislation would not authorize any new offshore drilling. Let me repeat. This legislation does not provide for new or expanded lease sales. This bill is about revenue sharing. Let me be clear on what revenue sharing means for a State like Louisiana, but there are many more. In Louisiana, we spend 100 percent of these revenues on environmental concerns--specifically coastal restoration. We lose about a football field worth of land in coastal Louisiana--just think of the football field you see every Sunday in an NFL game; that amount of land just in coastal Louisiana--every 38 minutes. That is 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 52 weeks a year, no time off for weekends, holidays, nothing. It is a constant loss. It is an environmental disaster. That is the most significant environmental issue by far that we face in our State. Our State is committed to spending all of the money we receive from revenue sharing to restore, rebuild, and protect our coast. That is vitally important for Louisiana, but it is also vitally important for the rest of the country because Louisiana supplies so much energy that is good for America. Let me be clear on what this legislation does. It expands revenue sharing to Alaska and the Mid-Atlantic States, so it has impacts well beyond the gulf in a very positive way. Beginning in 2027, Alaska, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia would begin receiving 37.5 percent revenue sharing from oil and gas production off of their coasts, which is what Louisiana, Texas, Alabama, and Mississippi receive on new production there. It would also increase revenue sharing that those Gulf States receive under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006, or GOMESA. Under that law, revenue sharing in those four Gulf States is capped at $500 million per year between all of them, but beginning in 2027, that cap would increase substantially. That cap right now is completely arbitrary and far too low. Revenue sharing is vital when it comes to adequately compensating States that help provide so much U.S. energy. It needs to be adequate if we are going to continue to incent those States to play that very important role in our U.S. economy. This legislation would help bring that objective to reality, and it is a critical component of a robust, strengthened revenue sharing regime for those major energy-producing States. I urge my colleagues to pass this important legislation. Again, I thank everyone who has worked on this, starting with my colleague from Louisiana, Senator Cassidy, who will be speaking on this topic immediately following me. With that, I welcome the Senator's remarks. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana. Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Vitter for his support, his kind words, and his tireless effort over his senatorial career to highlight the fact that Louisiana is losing so much land and there is something we need to do about it. I also thank Majority Leader McConnell for following through on his commitment to allow a vote on the American Energy and Conservation Act of 2016. This was introduced earlier this year by Senators Murkowski, Scott, Vitter, Tillis, Sullivan, and me. I thank each of them for their hard work. I also thank Senators Kaine and Warner for helping draft the Atlantic portion of the legislation and for cosponsoring an earlier version. As I just said, this is a bipartisan piece of legislation that uses an ``all of the above'' strategy to pursue true American energy independence. More than anything else, though, this legislation is about creating better jobs with better benefits. If there was one message we heard from this past election--if we actually listened to the American people, if we heard what they were saying, what we heard is that they want jobs that work for them, better jobs with better benefits. This helps accomplish that. For example, a study conducted by Quest Offshore Resources, Inc., projects that this legislation would incentivize the creation of 280,000 new jobs by 2035. That same study estimates $195 billion in new investments and an additional $51 billion in cumulative government revenue. That is $51 billion in new Federal revenue that this bill helps unlock. It goes a long way to addressing our debt, deficit, and obligation to future generations. The American Energy and Conservation Act will benefit American families and small businesses by expanding opportunities for States-- not just gulf coast but elsewhere--to support energy development. For years, energy activities in coastal Gulf States and adjacent offshore waters have produced billions of barrels of oil and trillions of cubic feet of natural gas for American families. These States support offshore energy development for the rest of the country and provide the support and pay for the infrastructure needed to bring this energy to market. As with all development, there are increased costs associated with supporting increased traffic, additional use of local and State resources, as well as transportation corridors such as pipelines, vessels, and trucks to get this energy delivered to consumers across the United States. This bill is truly an ``all of the above'' energy jobs bill. This legislation includes language introduced by Senators Heller, Heinrich, Risch, and Tester that streamlines the process for developing the renewable energy on public lands while establishing the first-ever revenue sharing paradigm for renewables. This legislation incentivizes tapping into the 27,000 megawatts of carbon-free energy that the Bureau of Land Management estimates could be provided by these projects. Furthermore, if offshore revenue exists for oil and gas development, the same should be true for offshore wind development. That is why we are using the same model established in GOMESA to extend revenue sharing to States that support offshore wind projects. This legislation thus incentivizes developing some of the 4,233 gigawatts of carbon-free generation that the Bureau of Land Management estimates is available for development off our coasts. This is the American Energy and Conservation Act of 2016. This legislation makes significant investments in conservation projects all over the United States. This legislation provides an additional $807 million for projects that increase access to public lands for hunting, fishing, and other outdoor recreational activities. This particular provision was included in Senator Murkowski's Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act of 2015, which 24 Senators have cosponsored. The legislation makes investments in a variety of important programs, including the Payment in Lieu of Taxes Program. This legislation is supported by over 50 important stakeholder groups, including the National Association of Manufacturers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American Chemistry Council, the American Petroleum Institute, and the Consumer Energy Alliance. These organizations understand that this legislation is a jobs builder and good policy for American workers. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, the American Energy and Conservation Act of 2016. I yield back. Mr. VITTER. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Remembering Jack Shatford Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, my Arkansan of the week is Jack Shatford, and the recognition is both honorary and, sadly, posthumous. Jack passed away last month during one of his many hunting trips to Arkansas. He loved our State and its people, and we all miss him badly. Jack first got to know Arkansas on the other side of the world in Vietnam. Jack and my dad Len served together in the same infantry squad in Vietnam in 1969 and 1970. They became closest of friends, a friendship that only grew over nearly a half century. Jack was from Missouri, so he and Dad were able to see each other regularly, often on deer-hunting trips in [[Page S6393]] Arkansas and duck- and goose-hunting trips in Missouri. He became like the brother my dad never had, a second son to my grandparents and Aunt Pood. Jack also got to know my mom Avis, just as my mom and dad got to know Jack's wife Joy. Over time, my sister and I came along and Jack and Joy became like an aunt and uncle to us, just like my parents felt about Kurt, Jack and Joy's son. Some of my oldest memories are traveling to Missouri to see the Shatfords at places like Six Flags, Silver Dollar City, and Branson and seeing how happy and excited my dad was in the days leading up to Jack's visits to Arkansas. Jack was a lifelong hunter and outdoorsman. He worked for 34 years at the Missouri Department of Conservation. If it flew, ran, or swam, you can pretty much bet that Jack knew how to find it, track it, kill it, and cook it. In fact, I have to confess that Jack probably put more meat on the Cotton family table than my dad ever did. He taught me a lot of lessons as well, not just about the outdoors but about life. Jack helped me see some things through my dad's eyes, and I figure he probably did the same thing for my dad. Their example from Vietnam contributed to my decision to join the Army. That wasn't an easy time in the Cotton household, believe me, but Jack was there to help smooth things over, and he encouraged me all along the way. Jack was a patriot. He had put his life on the line to defend the country we love so much. I know from my dad's war stories that Jack was fearless and brave, but he was also gentle and outgoing, the kind of guy who makes fast friends. He sure made a lot of friends in Dardanelle where he was like an adopted son. He even belonged to our Yell County Wildlife Federation. Above all, though, Jack was a loving family man, a devoted husband to Joy, and father to Kurt and his wife Mary, and Jack was a doting grandpa to Sarah and Shelby. They will miss Jack as we all miss him so dearly. The pain hasn't gone away yet. It will not for a while, and it may never go away, but with the pain, we ought to be swelled with pride and gratitude to have known and loved such a fine man. Jack Shatford, rest in peace and follow me. FUNDING OUR MILITARY Mr. President, the world may be more unstable than ever. The security architecture we built after World War II is at risk. Our parents and grandparents fought to keep the world free from a conflict between major powers. They created order out of the chaos of world war and genocide. They protected our freedom and ensured that our democratic ideals would be the dominant power in the world. The foundation of that order is the U.S. military. Since they toppled Nazi Germany and imperial Japan, they held firm against the North Korean assault on the democratic South. They faced down a powerful Soviet Union through decades of Cold War. They liberated Kuwait and have shed blood and sweat for over a decade, keeping America safe from Islamic terrorism. Today our military is composed solely of volunteers. We don't press our people into service. They choose to serve. Since the draft was abolished, we have had a basic compact with our men and women in uniform. In exchange for their service, we ensure that they have the best training, equipment, and leadership America has to offer. We make certain that if our troops must face the enemy, they are equipped to meet the task. With regret, I must say this compact is fraying and we are failing in our duty to our military. Today the Armed Forces face a growing number of threats and a shrinking budget. Russia is resurgent. They don't think they lost the Cold War, only that they were behind at halftime. Russia's invasion and occupation of Ukraine and Georgia make it clear that Moscow seeks to dominate its so-called near abroad. Moscow wants to divide the great Atlantic Alliance, viewing the confederation of democracies as a threat to the power and authority of a Putin government. Their bombers probe our airspace in ways unseen since the Cold War. They recently sent a carrier fleet through the English Channel. They probe our electronic defenses with daily cyber attacks and rattle the sabre of their nuclear arsenal at the West. China has also risen. They have sought to establish military control over the East and South China Seas. China also probes and attacks American servers, stealing vital military and industrial secrets. China has quadrupled its defense spending in the past few years, seeking control of the Pacific Rim. North Korea is growing a nuclear arsenal and developing the capability to hit any American city with those nuclear bombs. Iran continues to violate the terms of its nuclear agreement and is the world's worst state sponsor of terrorism. Just last month, Iranian- backed rebels fired Chinese anti-ship missiles at an American warship. Had it not been for the skill of the crew and our modern defenses, sailors may have come home in boxes. In Afghanistan, we lost 15 servicemembers in 2016. They continue to fight daily, protecting Americans from the threat of a resurgent terrorist threat. How do we repay their service? We have cut their budget by over $1 trillion. We have told them to do more with less. We have ignored their needs, long and repeated deployments, and brutal operations tempo. We have cut their pay, forced them to sail on rickety ships, and told them to fly on aircraft so old they date back to the Truman and Eisenhower administrations. This neglect has taken its toll. In January, 12 Marines died in a helicopter crash. Low readiness and subpar flying hours were to blame. Last week, six Green Berets were killed in 72 hours. They died in three separate incidents, stretching from the continental United States to Jordan, to Afghanistan. The Air Force is 4,000 airmen short of what is needed to maintain their fleet, and they are 700 pilots short to fly that fleet. They are salvaging parts from scrap yards to keep their aircraft flying. Since May, five F-18 Hornets and Super Hornets have crashed, killing two pilots and destroying all five jets. In the Army, just 30 percent of brigade combat teams are properly trained and equipped to fight. The Navy has had to defer maintenance for combat ships, leaving them more dangerous for the crews. We are wrong to ask our military to work and risk their lives under these conditions, and we cannot wait until the next fiscal year to fix this crisis because this is a crisis. This is no way to treat our troops and the military needs relief now. I will soon introduce a $26 billion emergency spending request, a lifeline to our overworked warfighters. The funds will be used to address immediate needs in military readiness and overseas operations. They will give our warfighters critical relief in these trying times. They will help keep our men and women in uniform safe as we ask them to do an increasingly dangerous job. I ask my colleagues to put aside old debates and do what is right for our Armed Forces. They are the ones risking their lives daily, not us. They are the ones out on the front lines defending our country, not us. They are the ones begging for help, and we are the ones obligated to provide it. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so ordered. Working Together Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it has been the great privilege and honor of my life to represent the people of Arizona in the Senate. I am humbled that in last Tuesday's election they placed their trust in me for another term. Since I first came to this body, I have never taken that trust for granted, and I never will. I will get up every day for the next 6 years determined to work harder than the day before for the people of Arizona. Of course, mine was not the only election last Tuesday. The American people did their civic duty and chose a [[Page S6394]] new President. I congratulate the President-elect. My prayers are with him and his family as he prepares to assume our Nation's highest office, and I will do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges confronting our Nation. This was a long and difficult national election and not always an uplifting one. I know there were many Americans who were disappointed on election night, and we have seen some of that disappointment in the protests that have taken place in several cities across the Nation. Some of those protesters have even taken to using the slogan ``Not my President.'' This is misguided. I have been on the losing side of elections before, and it is no fun. But America has only one President at a time. We do not have to agree with the President on every issue, and when we do disagree, we should express ourselves in the spirit of mutual respect that is essential for a free and democratic people. Therefore, I urge all Americans to offer our next President good will and an earnest effort to find ways to come together to make necessary compromises to grow our economy, defend our security, and leave future generations a stronger, better America. That better America is one in which we never forget that whatever our differences, we are all Americans. We must respect our common citizenship by treating each other with respect. That is why I have been so disturbed by reports of increased acts of intimidation, harassment, and even violence directed at minority, racial, and religious groups in the aftermath of this election. Prejudice and hate have no place in America. Such behavior is a betrayal of who we are as a people and all that we aspire to be. To those who have committed these disgusting acts, I repeat the words of the President-elect: Stop it. With the campaign over, it is time for all of us to go about the work the American people sent us here to do, and there is a lot of work to do. For too long, Washington has schemed, fought, and maneuvered to gain political advantage at the cost of delivering for the American people. The predictable result is that we have made little, if any, progress toward meeting the great challenges of our time and too many Americans feel left out and left behind. This election made clear that Americans are fed up with business as usual in Washington, and they want us to make progress now on solving national problems that threaten their ability to prosper and make a better life for their families. They want progress now on growing the economy and increasing their opportunities to live purposeful and satisfying lives. They want progress now to secure their families and America's interests from the dangerous threats we face overseas. As chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, America's national security and the men and women in uniform who protect it will be my top priorities. We have to put an end to business as usual at the Pentagon, where the largest government agency cannot pass a financial audit and where a broken acquisitions system is too often plagued by cost overruns, schedule delays, and poor performance. We have to put an end to sequestration once and for all and return to a strategy-based defense budget. It gives our servicemembers the resources, training, and equipment they need to meet current and future threats. We have to accelerate the defeat of ISIL in Iraq and Syria and continue to take the fight to radical Islamist terrorists who seek to attack our homeland. Above all, we must remain the free world's leader and stand up always and everywhere for the values that make us exceptional and to which all people are entitled: the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We have to reinvigorate America's alliances around the world, not discard them in favor of cynical deals with adversaries who want us to relinquish our global leadership. We have to enhance shared efforts to deter and, if necessary, defeat aggression from whatever power threatens our interests and values. Achieving these goals will require a team at the Department of Defense composed of the best people our Nation has to offer. The Senate Armed Services Committee stands ready to receive nominations from the new President. The stakes for our Nation are high. So too must be our standards. America has many challenges ahead, but none of us should despair of our present difficulties. Instead, we must believe always in the promise and greatness of America. I still do. In that spirit, my promise is this: to work as hard as I ever have; to use all my knowledge, experience, and relationships; and to work with our new President and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to solve our problems together as fellow Americans. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Congratulating the Chicago Cubs on Winning the World Series Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I rise to offer congratulations to the 2016 World Series champion Chicago Cubs, who are being congratulated in a resolution that I did with my colleague Senator Durbin. For 100 years, it seemed fitting that we would overcome the daunting three games to one to win the series. Many times I have said that any team can have a bad century, like 108 years. One of the most painful moments we have had as Cubs fans is watching the 1969 Cubs when we always knew we were going to beat the amazing Mets. I remember the names: the late Ron Santo, the late Ernie Banks, Fergie Jenkins, and Billy Williams. They were up nine games on the Mets but collapsed at the end of the season. In 2016, the Cubs blew away the 1969 record and went all the way. They removed the curse of the billy goat and the black cat. That toughness exemplifies the can-do spirit of the people of Illinois. No one deserves this championship more than the best baseball fans in the country, the Cubs fans. I also want to give a real shout-out to World Series MVP Ben Zobrist. Following the victory, I had the honor of riding in the victory parade. Over 5 million Chicagoans came to watch. I understand from the press that this was the seventh largest gathering in human history. Congratulations to the 2016 World Series champion Chicago Cubs. I want to send my thank you to Tom Ricketts, Theo Epstein, and Joe Maddon, the players, the fans, and everyone involved in making this the most unforgettable Cubs season. I yield back. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. RELIGIOUS FREEDOM Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, 1 year ago I came to the Senate floor for a series of eight speeches on a subject central to the identity and character of our country's religious freedom. As Congress unanimously declared less than two decades ago, religious freedom undergirds the very origin and existence of the United States. In that series of remarks, I started with the first principles to establish why religious freedom matters and must be given special protection. I reviewed the central role of religious freedom and the central role that religious freedom has played in shaping our country beginning long before independence. I have an example of how I phrased it on this chart. From the earliest settlers to the revolutionary generation, to the 19th century, to the modern day, religious freedom has been a driving force in American life. Without the quest for religious liberty, there would be no United States, and without the continued guarantee of religious freedom, there can be no American ideal. I also outlined the substance and status of religious freedom in America. In other words, I answered the questions of what religious freedom is and how important it is. From the pen of James Madison to the words of the First Amendment, from statutes to international treaties, religious freedom has [[Page S6395]] always been understood to include both belief and behavior in public and in private, collectively and individually. The status of the importance of religious freedom can be summed up in two words used repeatedly by America's Founders and leaders from the beginning: Religious freedom is both inalienable and preeminent. In last year's series of speeches, I also described the ways our government institutions are increasingly undermining religious freedom. These attacks come from, of course, the executive branch and even State legislatures, and they occur because our leaders have forgotten, ignored, or never really learned the fundamentals of religious freedom. A philosopher, George Santayana, wrote that ``those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.'' Put another way, as President Andrew Jackson warned as he left office, ``Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.'' ``You must pay the price,'' Jackson said, ``if you wish to secure the blessing.'' Unfortunately, we are no longer paying the price necessary to maintain this fundamental right. Either by negligence or intention, political forces in our society are radically changing what has been the very heart and soul of our great country. They want to restrict the substance of religious freedom so that it includes belief but not behavior; in private but not in public; individually but not collectively. They want to demote the status of religious freedom from inalienable and preeminent to optional and secondary. Examples abound in just the last several years. When the Obama administration and Democrats in Congress fashioned ObamaCare, for instance, they gave no thought to the law's impact on religious freedom. This is especially shocking given that Federal law required them to do so. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act sets a high standard for government actions that burden religious freedom and explicitly requires that Federal laws and regulations meet that standard. The Obama administration and congressional Democrats, however, ran roughshod over religious freedom in fashioning mandates and policies that force people to violate their deeply held religious beliefs. The Supreme Court has twice held that the birth control mandate in ObamaCare is incompatible with the protections for religious freedom that Congress previously and nearly unanimously enacted. Another example is before us today. Two years ago, President Obama issued a sweeping Executive order prohibiting Federal contractors and grant recipients from taking into account sexual orientation or gender identity when making employment decisions. The order itself is not a surprise. President Obama has been a supporter of LGBT rights throughout his Presidency and believes that gays and lesbians deserve the same job opportunities as everyone else. On that latter point, I-- along with most Americans--agree. What was remarkable about President Obama's order was that it contained no exemption for employers with religious affiliations. For years, laws prohibiting discrimination in employment and housing have routinely included religious liberty exemptions to protect religious organizations from having to take actions that contravene their beliefs. Such exemptions, for example, permit a religiously affiliated school that holds traditional views on marriage and human sexuality to offer married housing only to couples of the opposite sex or decline to hire as a faculty member an individual in a committed, same-sex relationship. These exemptions enable religious organizations to hold true to their beliefs while still complying with the law. President Obama's decision not to include a religious liberty exemption in his Executive order marked a sharp turn in the wrong direction. One year earlier, Senate Democrats had agreed to include a robust religious exemption in the Employment Nondiscrimination Act, or ENDA, a bill that would have prohibited sexual orientation discrimination in hiring by employers with at least 15 employees. ENDA's exemption tracked similar provisions in numerous State laws, including Utah's. Notwithstanding requests from religious groups, President Obama refused to include a similar exemption in his Executive order. His refusal means that a religious organization that wishes to compete for Federal funds may be forced to hire individuals who hold views or engage in conduct that contravenes the organization's religious beliefs. This is a direct attack on the ability of such organizations to preserve and promote their religious identity. Earlier this year, the House of Representatives took action to reverse the President's troubling refusal to protect religious employers. Back in May, the House passed the annual National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, to fund the Armed Forces. At the markup on the bill, Representative Steve Russell of Oklahoma offered, and the committee adopted, an amendment to the bill to clarify that religious organizations that contract with or receive grants from the Federal Government do not lose religious liberty. They do not lose religious liberty protections that they enjoy under other laws merely because they choose to work with the Federal Government. These protections, which are found in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Americans with Disabilities Act, include the ability to hire ``individuals of a particular religion to perform work connected with the [organization's] activities'' and to ``require that all applicants and employees conform to the [organization's] religious tenets.'' Such protections enable religious organizations to preserve their religious identity by hiring employees who share the organization's religious beliefs. Now, the Russell amendment affirms that religious organizations and schools enjoy these same protections when they contract with or receive grants from the Federal Government. The amendment embodies the commonsense, longstanding principle that religious organizations should not have to surrender control over their religious mission in order to interact with government. Unfortunately, there has been a lot of misinformation spread about the Russell amendment and what it does and does not do so let me take a moment to clear it up. Some have claimed the amendment would allow contractors to deny service to gays or lesbians or would enable any contractor who so wishes to make hiring decisions on the basis of religious beliefs. It would do no such thing. The amendment is limited only to hiring and employment practices and only to religiously affiliated corporations, associations, educational institutions, or societies, in conformance with the existing protections in the Civil Rights Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. The amendment clarifies that religious organizations do not lose religious liberty protections merely because they enter into contract with or receive grants from the Federal Government. That is it. We might think that a position reaffirming existing religious liberty protections would not raise eyebrows. Unfortunately, we would be wrong. President Obama swiftly expressed his opposition to the Russell amendment. Not only that, but he threatened to veto the entire NDAA, cutting off funding for the entire Department of Defense rather than allow the amendment to take effect. President Obama would rather shutter our Armed Forces than enable religious employers to select employees who share their particular values. Regrettably, the President has been joined in his opposition by 42 Senate Democrats who recently wrote a letter to the President outlining their ``strong opposition'' to the Russell amendment and asking the President to ``ensure that [the amendment] is removed from the final version of [the NDAA].'' The President and my Democratic colleagues are concerned, it seems, that if religious organizations that contract with the Federal Government are able to select employees who share the organization's religious beliefs, they may make decisions that liberals would disapprove of. For example, a religious family services charity may choose to hire individuals who hold traditional views on marriage and human sexuality. Because the President and my colleagues across the aisle do not share these views, they think religious organizations should be unable to take them into account when [[Page S6396]] seeking employees who will promote the organization's mission. It is difficult to imagine a position more at odds with our heritage of religious freedom. President Obama and Senate Democrats would empower the Federal Government to compel religious organizations to hire individuals who do not share the organization's religious beliefs. They would insert Federal tentacles into fundamental decisions regarding religious mission and identity. They would have the Federal Government declare off-limits traditional views on sexual orientation and gender identity that many Americans hold as a matter of religious conviction. But there is an even more pernicious aspect to the Democrats' position on this issue. Many liberals argue that claims of religious liberty are nothing more than a front for discrimination. They contend--with some force--that religious liberty claimants just don't like gay people or don't like women and use religion as a cover for their deep-seated animus toward disfavored groups. That is, of course, ridiculous. I would challenge anyone who holds this view to actually interact with a religious person. They will find, contrary to their own prejudices, that people of faith are loving, gracious, and polite and, more often than not, go out of their way to help the poor and the downtrodden. Religious believers don't treat others with kindness and charity despite their faith; they do so because of their faith. To my liberal friends, I say: Before you tar religious believers with whatever benighted stereotypes you see portrayed on TV and in the news media, get to know some of them. You will find your assumptions about them are totally wrong. Nevertheless, many liberals claim that religious liberty is a guise for discrimination. There is no reason, they say, for a religious organization or individual to seek an exemption from an otherwise equitable law, other than animus toward those the law is designed to protect. But what, then, are we to make of President Obama's Executive order and the left's reaction to the Russell amendment? President Obama could have included a religious liberty exemption in his order--such exemptions are standard in other laws, and numerous religious groups asked him to include one here--but he chose not to. Senate Democrats could easily have agreed to the Russell amendment, which does nothing more than reaffirm existing protections for religious employers--but they chose not to do so. What reason is there to exclude religious contractors and grant recipients from religious liberty protections that are otherwise generally available? Why single out such contractors and grant recipients for disfavor? It makes you wonder. Do my Democratic colleagues not see that the very argument they make against religious liberty can be turned against them? They are seeking to withdraw from religious contractors and grant recipients rights and protections that would otherwise be available under existing law. They are undermining the ability of believers to navigate between secular and spiritual demands. They are bringing to bear the sword of the State when they could easily stay their hand. It is difficult for me to look at the President's actions and those of my colleagues across the aisle and see anything other than discrimination against people of faith. They could give room for believers--as our Nation has done for centuries--but they choose not to. Rather, they cut and nip at religious liberty until all that remains is a hollow shell. I am left to wonder when the drive for equality became the drive to exclude and to undermine religion because that seems to be where we have arrived. Give a place for us, say people of faith. Allow us to live out our beliefs. We will abide the law, but we ask you to make reasonable accommodations. Surely a simple religious liberty exemption--indeed, one that is already part of our existing laws--would be reasonable. I close with an appeal to my Democratic colleagues. The outcome of the fight over the Russell amendment is not in doubt. Even if President Obama vetoes the NDAA or the Russell amendment is removed during conference, President Obama's Executive order will be withdrawn or else amended by the President-elect to include a religious liberty exemption. The Russell amendment will become law whether it is through congressional action or Executive order. The question for my colleagues across the aisle is whether they will stand up for the rights of religious contractors and grant recipients or whether they will join President Obama's losing battle against religious liberty. Will they protect people of faith or will they prosecute them? President Obama has cast his lot with the prosecution. It is not too late for my Democratic colleagues to choose a different course, and I hope and pray they will. These are not itty-bitty issues. These are issues that go right back to the core values of our country and our beliefs. Religious liberty is not something that can be cast aside. It is not something that should be cast aside. Religious liberty is a fundamental right, and we should not be playing around with it in the Congress. When there is prejudice and there is discrimination, that is another matter, but in virtually every case of religious liberty, I don't find that prejudice or discrimination. Our churches are a vibrant part of America, and we sure as heck ought to stand behind them and make sure religious liberty is always protected. I hope my colleagues will think these things through, I hope the 42 Democrats who voted to remove the Russell amendment will change their minds, and I hope they start to realize that religious freedom is not some itty-bitty thing. It is the thing in many respects that has been part of making America the greatest land in the world and the freest land in the world and the place where liberty includes real liberty. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I appear to be on the floor for Utah Day, with the junior Senator presiding and the senior Senator speaking. I am delighted to follow the senior Senator. I think in the boisterous days and months we will see ahead, his longstanding reputation for collegiality and reason and the respect in which his colleagues all hold him could become valuable attributes in our Senate. Climate Change Mr. President, I am here as the Senate reconvenes from the 2016 election recess to give my 149th climate speech, but I want first to congratulate my colleagues who were reelected and the new Members elected to the Senate and President-Elect Trump and Vice President- Elect Pence. With control of the White House and majorities coming in the House and the Senate, Republicans will wield great power in Washington, DC, and as the well-known saying goes, ``with great power comes great responsibility.'' In his acceptance speech, President-Elect Trump asked us all for help and guidance in governing this great Nation. My guidance would be first to be responsible. A key test will be whether our President-elect and Republicans here in the Senate choose to be responsible about climate change. I am gravely concerned about climate change, but based on the President-elect's campaign, he appears blissfully unconcerned, and Congress has been stalled by a decades-long industry-controlled campaign of calculated misinformation on the danger of carbon pollution and by just raw industry political pressure. But the President-elect will soon hear--and, hopefully, take it to heart--from a grownup world outside the creepy alt-right and the fossil fuel industry, a world of people who actually know what they are talking about. The President-elect will hear from our military and national security experts how deadly serious this is. Our former Pacific commander, Admiral Locklear, said it was the biggest national security threat we face in the Pacific theater. To use Admiral Locklear's exact words, ``climate change is probably the most likely thing that is going to happen . . . that will cripple the security environment, probably more likely than the other scenarios we all often talk about.'' Geoffrey Kemp, former Special Assistant to the President for National [[Page S6397]] Security Affairs under President Ronald Reagan, said: Our military and intelligence leadership have recognized, under both the George W. Bush and the Obama administrations, that climate change will present real and costly risks to our national security and that the effects are going to get worse if we don't do something about it very soon. As General Douglas MacArthur warned about the dangers of unpreparedness for war, we don't want to be too late. The President-elect will hear from our National Labs and from NOAA and NASA, the folks who put a rover on Mars and are driving it around and may know a little bit about real science, about the robust scientific consensus on climate change, and the urgency to change our course. If he doesn't trust our own scientific agencies, he can go to any major university in any State in the Nation and confirm what the government and military experts tell him. The President-elect will hear from world leaders who have pledged, alongside the United States, to work across borders to limit carbon emissions. The Paris Agreement brought nearly 200 countries together with the common goal of keeping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius and avoiding the most catastrophic outcomes for the planet and its people. He will also hear from CEOs across America, particularly those in the food and agriculture sectors who are living with climate change consequences every day, and from many others that we need to quit fooling around. I hope the President-elect will listen to these voices of reason and expertise. The people in our Nation certainly are listening. Polls show over 60 percent of Americans are concerned about global warming, and more than 80 percent of Americans favor action to reduce carbon pollution. Rhode Island, the Ocean State, would tell the administration that the oceans are the frontlines of climate change. The oceans have absorbed approximately 30 percent of the excess carbon dioxide that we have added to the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution--30 percent of it. They have also absorbed roughly 90 percent of the excess heat trapped in the atmosphere by those greenhouse gases. Without the oceans to absorb that added heat and carbon dioxide, we would not be worried about the 2-degree warming limit the world community is racing to avoid. We would be looking at a 30-degree increase, and life as our species knows it on this planet would be over. Oceans have spared us thus far from disaster, but what they have done to buffer our self-inflicted harm comes at its own cost. Global ocean temperatures are rising. In Rhode Island, Narragansett Bay's mean water temperature is up nearly 4 degrees Fahrenheit. Our Rhode Island lobster fishery is crashing, and our winter flounder fishery is gone. As water warms, of course, it also expands, and as glaciers melt, they add to the volume of the ocean. That is why sea levels are rising worldwide. The water is up about 10 inches at the Newport Naval Station tide gauge since the 1930s, and the Navy is actively planning how to defend the Norfolk Naval Station from rising seas. The effect of the ocean's absorbing all that carbon dioxide is a little different. It causes a chemical reaction. It is making ocean water more acidic. The ocean is acidifying and doing so at the fastest rate in 50 million years. Considering we have only been on the planet as a species for about 200,000 years, that is a long, long interval. Rhode Island's clammers, lobstermen, and aquaculture growers are watching with real alarm the damage acidified seas are doing. On America's northwest coast, oyster hatcheries have already experienced significant losses when their new hatches were unable to grow their shells in the acidified seawater. Off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and Northern California, 50 percent of ocean pteropods were measured to have ``severe shell damage,'' mostly from acidified seas. If that species collapses, the bottom falls out of the oceanic food chain. As the oceans go, so goes the planet. It is my sincere hope that President-Elect Trump will feel the call of history, of reason, and of patriotism to live up to the awesome responsibilities he now will bear. The 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, the so-called COP-22, is now taking place in Marrakech, Morocco. A similar gathering took place in Copenhagen 7 years ago. A full-page ad in the New York Times then called for passage of climate legislation in the United States for investment in the clean energy economy and for leadership to inspire the rest of the world to join the fight against climate change. It said: We must embrace the challenge today to ensure that future generations are left with a safe planet and a strong economy. . . . We support your effort-- They said to President Obama-- to ensure meaningful and effective measures to control climate change, an immediate challenge facing the United States and the world today. Please don't postpone the earth. If we fail to act now, it is scientifically irrefutable that there will be catastrophic and irreversible consequences for humanity and our planet. That full-page ad from which we took this was signed by Donald J. Trump, Chairman and President of the Trump organization. The signatories also included his children, Donald Jr., Eric, and Ivanka. Their future and their reputations are at stake too. The President-elect campaigned against big special interests controlling Washington, and he mocked Republican politicians groveling before the Koch brothers at their ``begathon,'' as he called it. He has a simple choice now. He can make his own decisions based on the best recommendations of our military, our national science laboratories, and our great universities, or he can fall in tow to the Koch brothers--the biggest special interest of them all. He can believe our National Labs and our National Aeronautics and Space Administration, or he can believe the National Enquirer. He can believe our military or he can believe the fossil fuel industry's denial apparatus. He can believe established scientific principles or he can believe fanciful conspiracy theories. His choice will be fateful, and the world and history will both be watching. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6388-S6397] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] AMERICAN ENERGY AND CONSERVATION ACT OF 2016--MOTION TO PROCEED The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of the motion to [[Page S6389]] proceed to S. 3110, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 543, S. 3110, a bill to provide for reforms of the administration of the outer Continental Shelf of the United States, to provide for the development of geothermal, solar, and wind energy on public land, and for other purposes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I want to speak on the bill. We are going to have a vote somewhere around midday tomorrow on this bill. This Senator comes to this issue with a long history of drilling for oil off our coast. Ever since I was a young Congressman, I have been fighting to keep oil rigs off Florida's coast. It is especially important at this time, as we have a new administration coming in that took a public position in the election declaring the intent of the President-elect to open up additional areas off the coast to oil drilling. The package that we are going to consider tomorrow is an enhancement of exactly that goal. I want to point out to the Senate why this is not in the interest of our country now. First of all, we are dealing with a law that we passed about 5 or 6 years ago with an acronym of GOMESA, which opened up for the first time oil revenues that came from Federal waters to be shared with the Gulf States. We were doing this primarily in the interests of Louisiana because Louisiana had been hit so hard by Hurricane Katrina, and there was a need to restore a lot of those marshes. This was another way of getting revenue to the State of Louisiana. At the same time that bill was passed, it enhanced a law that we had passed with my former colleague Senator Mel Martinez back in the 2006 timeframe that kept the oil drilling off Florida in the gulf--and kept it off, and it is in law. It is the only place of the Outer Continental Shelf where it is in law that you cannot drill up through the year 2022. I want to point out for the historical record why that is so and why this bill we are considering tomorrow is not in the interest of the country. This area in yellow is the Gulf of Mexico off of Florida. This is Florida, the peninsula, the Keys. This is the gulf coast of Florida. Over here is Pensacola. All of that area in yellow is off limits to drilling until the year 2022. Why? Well, it does not take a rocket scientist to realize what happened to Florida's economy after the Deep Water Horizon oil spill. The oil got as far as Pensacola. The spill was over here off of Louisiana. It got to the beaches of Pensacola, some to Destin, some tar balls to Panama City, until the wind started sending it back the other way. But what happened to Florida's tourism industry on its gulf coast for an entire season? The tourists thought there was oil on our beaches, and tourists did not come for an entire season all the way down to Marco Island, Naples--all of those beautiful sugary white sand beaches, including the beaches of Northwest Florida. They did not come because they thought there was oil there. That did not just affect the airlines and the hotels. It affected the dry cleaners and the restaurants and all of the largest industry in Florida, which is the tourism industry. That is one reason. Another reason is that there are so many of the bays and estuaries along this gulf coast where the critters are hatched that supply the fish stocks for the entire gulf. Of course, there are stocks that are hatched here that migrate out into the other oceans. But there is a third reason. That reason is that all of this area to the east of this line--in other words, 125 miles off Panama City, 235 miles off Tampa Bay, even further off Naples--all of that is the largest testing and training area in the world for the U.S. military. The Department of Defense has issued two letters under the signatures of two Republican Secretaries of Defense saying that any oil-related activities here would be incompatible with our testing and training mission, this being the largest one in the United States. That is why we do not have drilling there. You will hear the proponents of the bill say: Well, we have exempted this part. We have exempted it not only because it is off limits in law, but what they are doing to the rest of the gulf coast is almost doubling the revenue sharing that would go to the States, the Gulf States, thereby giving even more incentive for the State governments to want to have drilling off of their coasts regardless of the U.S. military, regardless of the economic engine of Florida, regardless of the very delicate environment. But there is more. As a matter of fact, the bill before us would offer revenue sharing to States. Mind you, this is drilling in Federal waters. Any revenue would typically go to the Federal Government. As a matter of fact, it is estimated by CBO that it would be a loss of $7 billion to the U.S. Treasury. That would also be available for the States on the Atlantic. Here is Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and on up on the Atlantic coast. I brought this chart to show not only the gulf area off of Florida and the military testing and training ranges, but to look at the military testing and training ranges off the Atlantic coast. If it is incompatible here, are we not going to hear, as we have heard from some in the Department of Defense, that it is going to be incompatible in the Atlantic region? I want to urge that not only have we been battling to keep our coastal environments and beaches clean and unpolluted--that is not the only argument. The argument is also one of keeping our national security tested and trained in the most sophisticated weapons and training for the best military in the world. This Senator is a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. There is a reason that we do not have oil rigs out here. First of all, in the State of Florida, we have Tyndall Air Force Base at Panama City. That is where they are training our pilots on F-22s. At Eglin Air Force Base near Fort Walton Beach, that is where about half of the U.S. Air Force training and the other services--the Navy as well as the Air Force--are training their pilots for the F-35 that is now being cycled in to be the workhorse of our fighters. The U.S. Navy, which will have F-35s but presently has F-18s, will fly a squadron to Key West Naval Air Station. They will be there for a week or two. When they lift off from the runway at Boca Chica Key, in 2 minutes they could be over restricted airspace, not having spent a lot of time and fuel to get to the area of restriction for their testing and training. So the Department of Defense has said: You simply cannot have oil rigs operating in an area where we are testing these very sophisticated weapons systems--and they need a lot of space; from this location down here, this is some 300 miles--as well as the training that goes on. It is not just for the benefit of our military, it is key to our national defense. We have watched the tar balls wash up on the beaches. We have seen the sugary white sands of Pensacola Beach completely black, covered in oil. We saw the harm that was done to not only the local businesses that cater to tourists, such as the hotels, restaurants, and attractions, but to all the ancillary businesses, such as the drycleaners and the real estate firms. To put it into perspective, for our State of Florida, this is a $50 billion industry that oils the engine of our economy. We are talking about generating some $700 million in sales tax revenue for the State, and it helps support more than 450,000 jobs throughout the State. Why would you risk destroying a State's economy as well as our military preparation? It is not as if we don't have other places that we want to produce oil. Think of the oil shale that has been tapped in the Dakotas, in Oklahoma, and in Texas that is not producing at maximum capacity. As Floridians, the images of the hazmat crews in those hazmat suits and the Coast Guard vessels skimming off the water just 6 years ago are emblazoned on our memories. Our fishermen and our businesses certainly haven't forgotten their own losses that amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars. So if the new administration and the oil industry want to have a fight on in issue, well, they certainly have one. This Senator is going to continue to try to keep the oil rigs off the State of Florida with everything I have, for all of the reasons I have stated. [[Page S6390]] When we vote tomorrow, I would commend to our colleagues to beware of all of the effects of almost doubling the revenue for the Gulf Coast States of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, which is at the heart of what is behind this particular bill we are going to vote on, but also beware there are hidden messages in this revenue sharing, and it strikes at the heart of what we have been trying to protect here-- the environment, our economy, and our U.S. military preparedness. I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Bringing People Together Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, as long as no other Senator is asking to be recognized, let me just say that from the perspective of the senior Senator from Florida, I think it is the obligation of those of us who were backing the candidate who did not win the Presidency--as President Obama has said, the President-elect will be the President. It is incumbent upon the rest of us, regardless of party, to reach out and to try to help the new President on behalf of and for the sake of our country. This Senator, who in four decades of public service has always tried to reach out in a bipartisan way and bring people together, to build consensus in order to govern, will continue to do so, and this Senator greets the new administration with that statement. It is important that a statement like that be made, especially in this time where we are so rent asunder, where we are so divided, and where we have come through an election that has been--the only word I can think of is ``ugly.'' Things were said in the ordinary course of conversation in this election that should not have been said. Particularly as we try to heal the wounds of both sides and take back the awful things that were said and create an atmosphere where we can come together for the sake of our country, that is especially important, and this Senator is going to contribute to that. It is my hope that it will be received on all sides and that we will reach out and try to bring people together. I think it is important to say that, particularly at a time where feelings have been hurt and feelings have been so high and so tense. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Working Together Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, we are living in historic times. The 115th Congress will be the first time in a decade that Republicans have held both Chambers of Congress and the White House. Before the George W. Bush administration in the early part of this century, you would have to go back to the Eisenhower administration--I believe it was 1953--to find a comparable time of Republican control. Interestingly, for the history buffs who may be listening, there have actually been 14 times since 1945 when we have had single-party majorities in both Houses and the White House. Eleven of those times have been our Democratic colleagues and three times have been Republicans. So I come back to where I started in saying these are truly historic times. This morning, our Republican conference met to elect our leadership team to serve in the next Congress during this extraordinary time. After gaining the majority 2 years ago, it has been a pleasure to look back and see what we have been able to accomplish even with the President from the opposing party in the White House. Yesterday I mentioned the rewrite of No Child Left Behind, which sent more authority back to the States, parents, and teachers to make education decisions for children in kindergarten through 12th grade. I also mentioned passing a long-term highway bill for 5 years--something we hadn't been able to do for a long time. Those are just two concrete examples of how, working together, we can tackle big, intractable problems. Frankly, nothing happens in the Senate unless it is bipartisan. We also passed some other important legislation, something negotiated by the majority leader in the House at the time, Nancy Pelosi, or Leader Pelosi, and Speaker John Boehner, which was the reform of our Social Security laws in terms of how doctors under Medicare are paid. It is an important item because if doctors are not paid a prevailing fee or competitive fee for their services, they are simply not going to see Medicare patients and seniors are not going to have access to the care they deserve. We passed a bill sanctioning North Korea for its nuclear program and its human rights abuses. We also passed legislation to better support our troops, who fight and put themselves in harm's way to keep us safe every day. I am grateful to our Republican colleagues for voting to continue the direction of progress for the American people by reelecting their current leadership, including the senior Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell. As all of us have, I have had the honor to serve alongside Senator McConnell for several years now, although I have served for the last 4 years as the whip or the right hand of the majority leader when it comes to trying to corral votes and trying to promote our legislative agenda. I found the majority leader to be a wise and steady hand in a town marked by the absence of those virtues, among many. So I am proud to serve with him in the next Congress, as I am with all of our colleagues, and in his case as the majority leader, as his assistant. We also had a chance, having come back together after the election, to talk about the future and to talk about our agenda going forward. Yesterday I pointed out several legislative priorities at the top of the list--policy items we have to get right on behalf of the American people--such as confirming a Supreme Court Justice who will interpret the laws as we write them and as the Constitution is written, rather than as another policymaking branch of government. We have also promised we would repeal and replace ObamaCare, which was a failed experiment--failed because the President, when he promoted it, said: If you like what you have, you can keep it. He said: If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. And he said: An average family of four will see their premiums go down $2,500. None of that has been proven to be true. So it is very important we keep that promise of repealing ObamaCare and then replace it on a step-by-step basis over a transition period with more affordable health care that will preserve the choices in health care through Americans and their families and not Washington, DC. And then there is the matter of legislation. After our Democratic friends lost their 60-vote majority in the Senate and the Republicans flipped the House, providing for a divided government, the one thing that has characterized the Obama administration has been its Executive actions and overregulation. In August, it was reported the President and his administration had issued 600 major regulations with a pricetag of more than $740 billion. If there is one thing I hear from my constituents back in Texas-- small business owners and the like--it is that they are feeling the strangling effect of overregulation, along with the cost of compliance and the uncertainty that goes along with it. So it is no surprise to see that our economy has essentially flatlined and not been growing because none of this is good for the small business owners we are relying upon to create jobs and opportunities, and it is not good for American families looking for those jobs in order to provide for their families and simply put food on the table. So we are eager to roll back those expensive, and in many instances unnecessary, certainly in every instance burdensome regulations so the economy can have some breathing room and begin to grow again. Many of us are interested in addressing tax reform as well. There is bipartisan consensus that our Tax Code is simply too complex and counterproductive. In fact, it is literally a self- [[Page S6391]] inflicted wound when it comes to forcing $2 trillion-plus overseas that American-based companies would like to bring back, but the reason they do not is they would be subject to double taxation, first, in the country where the money has been earned and, secondly, when they bring it back to the United States. Rather than do that, many of them will leave that money overseas. That means that rather than investing in American jobs and American infrastructure, they are literally investing in jobs overseas and in building infrastructure to support their facilities in other countries. That makes no sense whatsoever. So tax reform is high on our agenda. I believe, and I am optimistic, that at a time when everybody understands our Tax Code has simply gotten too complex, too expensive, and too counterproductive, we will be able to make some real progress. Coming from a border State, I can tell you I am delighted to hear President Elect Trump talk about the importance of border security. In a post-9/11 world, it is simply critical we know who is coming into our country and make sure they do so only by legal means. So securing our border is something we need to deal with, and thank goodness there is no shortage of good ideas. Chairman Mike McCaul of the House Homeland Security Committee has a bipartisan bill I think would make great progress along those lines, but obviously we are going to have to have an important discussion among all Members of Congress and the administration about how best to accomplish the goal. We also need to remember our ports of entry are where legitimate trade and travel occur, and we should do nothing to impede that because legitimate trade and travel are very important to our economy. The U.S. economy enjoys about 6 million jobs as a result of trade between the United States and Mexico alone. So I look forward to working with the administration and with our colleagues to make sure we secure our border against illegal immigration, including human trafficking, drug trafficking, and the potential violence that goes along with that, while making sure our legitimate trade and travel at our ports of entry are supported so we can benefit from those as well. Of course, as we debated earlier this Congress, having an updated and efficient infrastructure is vital to the health and well-being of our economy. I mentioned the Transportation bill we passed. A long-term Transportation bill will provide for some of that, but certainly not all that is necessary. We need to take a look at the proposals the President-elect is going to send our way, but there is no shortage of good ideas being discussed both in the House and the Senate as well. I look forward to learning more about those, but one thing that hasn't been talked about very much is how we are going to pay for it, and that is going to be an important item to discuss as well. Frankly, we can't keep spending our kids' and grandkids' inheritance or at least forcing upon the younger generations the obligation to pay for bills we incur today. One of the things I hope will occur as a result of this historic election is that we will have the courage and the willingness to sit down and come up with structural solutions to our financial situation, which is $19 trillion-plus in debt. Because of the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates very low, we are not having to pay huge amounts of money in order to service that debt or pay interest to the people who own that debt, but that is going to change if the Federal Reserve begins to raise interest rates, and we are going to find ourselves paying more and more money to service that debt to the bondholders and less and less of that money will be available for our priorities domestically, whether they be national security or other investments in things such as medical research and the like. So finding out how we can crack that nut and come together on a bipartisan basis, working with the White House to deal with our long- term fiscal problems and continuing to meet the needs of our Nation are going to be challenging but exhilarating to do. Many are talking about the next steps and what should and shouldn't happen in light of the new political reality, but what is clear to me today is that Republicans are united by a strong desire to listen to the concerns of the American people and to deliver results--results that make their lives easier and our collective futures stronger. I want to say that as committed as the majority party is to that, we can't do this without the cooperation and consensus building that comes along as part of the legislative process. Unfortunately, we have seen the last years characterized by obstruction and filibusters and blocking things that essentially have already received bipartisan support. I am talking particularly about the appropriations process. One of the terrible things that happened this last year in the Congress is the Appropriations Committees have gotten back to work on a bipartisan basis. We would see bills coming out at a fiscally responsible level, with agreed-upon spending caps and Democrats and Republicans supporting them, only to see them dead on arrival on the floor of the Senate. That is the kind of mindless obstructionism I hope we can avoid going forward. Just from the conversations I have had as a result of this election, many of our Democratic colleagues appear to be willing to work with us. Certainly, with the new leadership on the Democratic side of the aisle, I am more optimistic than I have been in a long time that we can come together while maintaining our strongly held convictions and principles--I am not talking about compromising those but rather working together when we can--and try to develop more ideas to better serve the American people. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 3110, the American Energy and Conservation Act of 2016. This would increase revenue-sharing with the States for offshore oil and gas development. This legislation is scheduled for a vote on the Senate floor tomorrow. I am pleased the Senate is finally voting on this critical legislation, and I thank my colleague from Louisiana, Senator Cassidy, for his lead and his hard work on this crucial issue. Senator Cassidy and I and several of our colleagues have worked hard over the years to bring this issue to the forefront and help both Congress and the American people understand how important revenue-sharing is not only to Louisiana, to other energy-producing States, but to the country and for the good of the country to expand American energy. I also thank Leader McConnell and Chairman Murkowski for working with us to bring this important bill to the floor for a vote. Revenue sharing with oil- and gas-producing States is only fair, for two key reasons: First, energy-producing States incur real costs and real impacts from that production, including environmental, and second, revenue sharing is the most important way we can continue to incent domestic energy production over the long term in this country. It makes it fair and smart for our U.S. energy future. Energy production is essential to job creation and an overall healthy economy. If it weren't for the oil and gas jobs that accompanied the energy sector boom earlier this decade, we would perhaps still be in a technical recession. One point I want to emphasize is that many of those jobs have been created by small firms in the oil and gas sector and support sectors. These small business energy jobs are something I have highlighted in my role as chair of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, and they are vital in terms of the impact in this sector. This legislation would increase revenue sharing for the Gulf States that produce energy offshore and would establish revenue sharing for new production off of Alaska and off of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. These are all areas that welcome the opportunity to have this revenue sharing to incent domestic energy production and increase the availability of American energy. [[Page S6392]] Contrary to what some have said, this legislation would not authorize any new offshore drilling. Let me repeat. This legislation does not provide for new or expanded lease sales. This bill is about revenue sharing. Let me be clear on what revenue sharing means for a State like Louisiana, but there are many more. In Louisiana, we spend 100 percent of these revenues on environmental concerns--specifically coastal restoration. We lose about a football field worth of land in coastal Louisiana--just think of the football field you see every Sunday in an NFL game; that amount of land just in coastal Louisiana--every 38 minutes. That is 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 52 weeks a year, no time off for weekends, holidays, nothing. It is a constant loss. It is an environmental disaster. That is the most significant environmental issue by far that we face in our State. Our State is committed to spending all of the money we receive from revenue sharing to restore, rebuild, and protect our coast. That is vitally important for Louisiana, but it is also vitally important for the rest of the country because Louisiana supplies so much energy that is good for America. Let me be clear on what this legislation does. It expands revenue sharing to Alaska and the Mid-Atlantic States, so it has impacts well beyond the gulf in a very positive way. Beginning in 2027, Alaska, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia would begin receiving 37.5 percent revenue sharing from oil and gas production off of their coasts, which is what Louisiana, Texas, Alabama, and Mississippi receive on new production there. It would also increase revenue sharing that those Gulf States receive under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006, or GOMESA. Under that law, revenue sharing in those four Gulf States is capped at $500 million per year between all of them, but beginning in 2027, that cap would increase substantially. That cap right now is completely arbitrary and far too low. Revenue sharing is vital when it comes to adequately compensating States that help provide so much U.S. energy. It needs to be adequate if we are going to continue to incent those States to play that very important role in our U.S. economy. This legislation would help bring that objective to reality, and it is a critical component of a robust, strengthened revenue sharing regime for those major energy-producing States. I urge my colleagues to pass this important legislation. Again, I thank everyone who has worked on this, starting with my colleague from Louisiana, Senator Cassidy, who will be speaking on this topic immediately following me. With that, I welcome the Senator's remarks. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana. Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Vitter for his support, his kind words, and his tireless effort over his senatorial career to highlight the fact that Louisiana is losing so much land and there is something we need to do about it. I also thank Majority Leader McConnell for following through on his commitment to allow a vote on the American Energy and Conservation Act of 2016. This was introduced earlier this year by Senators Murkowski, Scott, Vitter, Tillis, Sullivan, and me. I thank each of them for their hard work. I also thank Senators Kaine and Warner for helping draft the Atlantic portion of the legislation and for cosponsoring an earlier version. As I just said, this is a bipartisan piece of legislation that uses an ``all of the above'' strategy to pursue true American energy independence. More than anything else, though, this legislation is about creating better jobs with better benefits. If there was one message we heard from this past election--if we actually listened to the American people, if we heard what they were saying, what we heard is that they want jobs that work for them, better jobs with better benefits. This helps accomplish that. For example, a study conducted by Quest Offshore Resources, Inc., projects that this legislation would incentivize the creation of 280,000 new jobs by 2035. That same study estimates $195 billion in new investments and an additional $51 billion in cumulative government revenue. That is $51 billion in new Federal revenue that this bill helps unlock. It goes a long way to addressing our debt, deficit, and obligation to future generations. The American Energy and Conservation Act will benefit American families and small businesses by expanding opportunities for States-- not just gulf coast but elsewhere--to support energy development. For years, energy activities in coastal Gulf States and adjacent offshore waters have produced billions of barrels of oil and trillions of cubic feet of natural gas for American families. These States support offshore energy development for the rest of the country and provide the support and pay for the infrastructure needed to bring this energy to market. As with all development, there are increased costs associated with supporting increased traffic, additional use of local and State resources, as well as transportation corridors such as pipelines, vessels, and trucks to get this energy delivered to consumers across the United States. This bill is truly an ``all of the above'' energy jobs bill. This legislation includes language introduced by Senators Heller, Heinrich, Risch, and Tester that streamlines the process for developing the renewable energy on public lands while establishing the first-ever revenue sharing paradigm for renewables. This legislation incentivizes tapping into the 27,000 megawatts of carbon-free energy that the Bureau of Land Management estimates could be provided by these projects. Furthermore, if offshore revenue exists for oil and gas development, the same should be true for offshore wind development. That is why we are using the same model established in GOMESA to extend revenue sharing to States that support offshore wind projects. This legislation thus incentivizes developing some of the 4,233 gigawatts of carbon-free generation that the Bureau of Land Management estimates is available for development off our coasts. This is the American Energy and Conservation Act of 2016. This legislation makes significant investments in conservation projects all over the United States. This legislation provides an additional $807 million for projects that increase access to public lands for hunting, fishing, and other outdoor recreational activities. This particular provision was included in Senator Murkowski's Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act of 2015, which 24 Senators have cosponsored. The legislation makes investments in a variety of important programs, including the Payment in Lieu of Taxes Program. This legislation is supported by over 50 important stakeholder groups, including the National Association of Manufacturers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American Chemistry Council, the American Petroleum Institute, and the Consumer Energy Alliance. These organizations understand that this legislation is a jobs builder and good policy for American workers. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, the American Energy and Conservation Act of 2016. I yield back. Mr. VITTER. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Remembering Jack Shatford Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, my Arkansan of the week is Jack Shatford, and the recognition is both honorary and, sadly, posthumous. Jack passed away last month during one of his many hunting trips to Arkansas. He loved our State and its people, and we all miss him badly. Jack first got to know Arkansas on the other side of the world in Vietnam. Jack and my dad Len served together in the same infantry squad in Vietnam in 1969 and 1970. They became closest of friends, a friendship that only grew over nearly a half century. Jack was from Missouri, so he and Dad were able to see each other regularly, often on deer-hunting trips in [[Page S6393]] Arkansas and duck- and goose-hunting trips in Missouri. He became like the brother my dad never had, a second son to my grandparents and Aunt Pood. Jack also got to know my mom Avis, just as my mom and dad got to know Jack's wife Joy. Over time, my sister and I came along and Jack and Joy became like an aunt and uncle to us, just like my parents felt about Kurt, Jack and Joy's son. Some of my oldest memories are traveling to Missouri to see the Shatfords at places like Six Flags, Silver Dollar City, and Branson and seeing how happy and excited my dad was in the days leading up to Jack's visits to Arkansas. Jack was a lifelong hunter and outdoorsman. He worked for 34 years at the Missouri Department of Conservation. If it flew, ran, or swam, you can pretty much bet that Jack knew how to find it, track it, kill it, and cook it. In fact, I have to confess that Jack probably put more meat on the Cotton family table than my dad ever did. He taught me a lot of lessons as well, not just about the outdoors but about life. Jack helped me see some things through my dad's eyes, and I figure he probably did the same thing for my dad. Their example from Vietnam contributed to my decision to join the Army. That wasn't an easy time in the Cotton household, believe me, but Jack was there to help smooth things over, and he encouraged me all along the way. Jack was a patriot. He had put his life on the line to defend the country we love so much. I know from my dad's war stories that Jack was fearless and brave, but he was also gentle and outgoing, the kind of guy who makes fast friends. He sure made a lot of friends in Dardanelle where he was like an adopted son. He even belonged to our Yell County Wildlife Federation. Above all, though, Jack was a loving family man, a devoted husband to Joy, and father to Kurt and his wife Mary, and Jack was a doting grandpa to Sarah and Shelby. They will miss Jack as we all miss him so dearly. The pain hasn't gone away yet. It will not for a while, and it may never go away, but with the pain, we ought to be swelled with pride and gratitude to have known and loved such a fine man. Jack Shatford, rest in peace and follow me. FUNDING OUR MILITARY Mr. President, the world may be more unstable than ever. The security architecture we built after World War II is at risk. Our parents and grandparents fought to keep the world free from a conflict between major powers. They created order out of the chaos of world war and genocide. They protected our freedom and ensured that our democratic ideals would be the dominant power in the world. The foundation of that order is the U.S. military. Since they toppled Nazi Germany and imperial Japan, they held firm against the North Korean assault on the democratic South. They faced down a powerful Soviet Union through decades of Cold War. They liberated Kuwait and have shed blood and sweat for over a decade, keeping America safe from Islamic terrorism. Today our military is composed solely of volunteers. We don't press our people into service. They choose to serve. Since the draft was abolished, we have had a basic compact with our men and women in uniform. In exchange for their service, we ensure that they have the best training, equipment, and leadership America has to offer. We make certain that if our troops must face the enemy, they are equipped to meet the task. With regret, I must say this compact is fraying and we are failing in our duty to our military. Today the Armed Forces face a growing number of threats and a shrinking budget. Russia is resurgent. They don't think they lost the Cold War, only that they were behind at halftime. Russia's invasion and occupation of Ukraine and Georgia make it clear that Moscow seeks to dominate its so-called near abroad. Moscow wants to divide the great Atlantic Alliance, viewing the confederation of democracies as a threat to the power and authority of a Putin government. Their bombers probe our airspace in ways unseen since the Cold War. They recently sent a carrier fleet through the English Channel. They probe our electronic defenses with daily cyber attacks and rattle the sabre of their nuclear arsenal at the West. China has also risen. They have sought to establish military control over the East and South China Seas. China also probes and attacks American servers, stealing vital military and industrial secrets. China has quadrupled its defense spending in the past few years, seeking control of the Pacific Rim. North Korea is growing a nuclear arsenal and developing the capability to hit any American city with those nuclear bombs. Iran continues to violate the terms of its nuclear agreement and is the world's worst state sponsor of terrorism. Just last month, Iranian- backed rebels fired Chinese anti-ship missiles at an American warship. Had it not been for the skill of the crew and our modern defenses, sailors may have come home in boxes. In Afghanistan, we lost 15 servicemembers in 2016. They continue to fight daily, protecting Americans from the threat of a resurgent terrorist threat. How do we repay their service? We have cut their budget by over $1 trillion. We have told them to do more with less. We have ignored their needs, long and repeated deployments, and brutal operations tempo. We have cut their pay, forced them to sail on rickety ships, and told them to fly on aircraft so old they date back to the Truman and Eisenhower administrations. This neglect has taken its toll. In January, 12 Marines died in a helicopter crash. Low readiness and subpar flying hours were to blame. Last week, six Green Berets were killed in 72 hours. They died in three separate incidents, stretching from the continental United States to Jordan, to Afghanistan. The Air Force is 4,000 airmen short of what is needed to maintain their fleet, and they are 700 pilots short to fly that fleet. They are salvaging parts from scrap yards to keep their aircraft flying. Since May, five F-18 Hornets and Super Hornets have crashed, killing two pilots and destroying all five jets. In the Army, just 30 percent of brigade combat teams are properly trained and equipped to fight. The Navy has had to defer maintenance for combat ships, leaving them more dangerous for the crews. We are wrong to ask our military to work and risk their lives under these conditions, and we cannot wait until the next fiscal year to fix this crisis because this is a crisis. This is no way to treat our troops and the military needs relief now. I will soon introduce a $26 billion emergency spending request, a lifeline to our overworked warfighters. The funds will be used to address immediate needs in military readiness and overseas operations. They will give our warfighters critical relief in these trying times. They will help keep our men and women in uniform safe as we ask them to do an increasingly dangerous job. I ask my colleagues to put aside old debates and do what is right for our Armed Forces. They are the ones risking their lives daily, not us. They are the ones out on the front lines defending our country, not us. They are the ones begging for help, and we are the ones obligated to provide it. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so ordered. Working Together Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it has been the great privilege and honor of my life to represent the people of Arizona in the Senate. I am humbled that in last Tuesday's election they placed their trust in me for another term. Since I first came to this body, I have never taken that trust for granted, and I never will. I will get up every day for the next 6 years determined to work harder than the day before for the people of Arizona. Of course, mine was not the only election last Tuesday. The American people did their civic duty and chose a [[Page S6394]] new President. I congratulate the President-elect. My prayers are with him and his family as he prepares to assume our Nation's highest office, and I will do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges confronting our Nation. This was a long and difficult national election and not always an uplifting one. I know there were many Americans who were disappointed on election night, and we have seen some of that disappointment in the protests that have taken place in several cities across the Nation. Some of those protesters have even taken to using the slogan ``Not my President.'' This is misguided. I have been on the losing side of elections before, and it is no fun. But America has only one President at a time. We do not have to agree with the President on every issue, and when we do disagree, we should express ourselves in the spirit of mutual respect that is essential for a free and democratic people. Therefore, I urge all Americans to offer our next President good will and an earnest effort to find ways to come together to make necessary compromises to grow our economy, defend our security, and leave future generations a stronger, better America. That better America is one in which we never forget that whatever our differences, we are all Americans. We must respect our common citizenship by treating each other with respect. That is why I have been so disturbed by reports of increased acts of intimidation, harassment, and even violence directed at minority, racial, and religious groups in the aftermath of this election. Prejudice and hate have no place in America. Such behavior is a betrayal of who we are as a people and all that we aspire to be. To those who have committed these disgusting acts, I repeat the words of the President-elect: Stop it. With the campaign over, it is time for all of us to go about the work the American people sent us here to do, and there is a lot of work to do. For too long, Washington has schemed, fought, and maneuvered to gain political advantage at the cost of delivering for the American people. The predictable result is that we have made little, if any, progress toward meeting the great challenges of our time and too many Americans feel left out and left behind. This election made clear that Americans are fed up with business as usual in Washington, and they want us to make progress now on solving national problems that threaten their ability to prosper and make a better life for their families. They want progress now on growing the economy and increasing their opportunities to live purposeful and satisfying lives. They want progress now to secure their families and America's interests from the dangerous threats we face overseas. As chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, America's national security and the men and women in uniform who protect it will be my top priorities. We have to put an end to business as usual at the Pentagon, where the largest government agency cannot pass a financial audit and where a broken acquisitions system is too often plagued by cost overruns, schedule delays, and poor performance. We have to put an end to sequestration once and for all and return to a strategy-based defense budget. It gives our servicemembers the resources, training, and equipment they need to meet current and future threats. We have to accelerate the defeat of ISIL in Iraq and Syria and continue to take the fight to radical Islamist terrorists who seek to attack our homeland. Above all, we must remain the free world's leader and stand up always and everywhere for the values that make us exceptional and to which all people are entitled: the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We have to reinvigorate America's alliances around the world, not discard them in favor of cynical deals with adversaries who want us to relinquish our global leadership. We have to enhance shared efforts to deter and, if necessary, defeat aggression from whatever power threatens our interests and values. Achieving these goals will require a team at the Department of Defense composed of the best people our Nation has to offer. The Senate Armed Services Committee stands ready to receive nominations from the new President. The stakes for our Nation are high. So too must be our standards. America has many challenges ahead, but none of us should despair of our present difficulties. Instead, we must believe always in the promise and greatness of America. I still do. In that spirit, my promise is this: to work as hard as I ever have; to use all my knowledge, experience, and relationships; and to work with our new President and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to solve our problems together as fellow Americans. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Congratulating the Chicago Cubs on Winning the World Series Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I rise to offer congratulations to the 2016 World Series champion Chicago Cubs, who are being congratulated in a resolution that I did with my colleague Senator Durbin. For 100 years, it seemed fitting that we would overcome the daunting three games to one to win the series. Many times I have said that any team can have a bad century, like 108 years. One of the most painful moments we have had as Cubs fans is watching the 1969 Cubs when we always knew we were going to beat the amazing Mets. I remember the names: the late Ron Santo, the late Ernie Banks, Fergie Jenkins, and Billy Williams. They were up nine games on the Mets but collapsed at the end of the season. In 2016, the Cubs blew away the 1969 record and went all the way. They removed the curse of the billy goat and the black cat. That toughness exemplifies the can-do spirit of the people of Illinois. No one deserves this championship more than the best baseball fans in the country, the Cubs fans. I also want to give a real shout-out to World Series MVP Ben Zobrist. Following the victory, I had the honor of riding in the victory parade. Over 5 million Chicagoans came to watch. I understand from the press that this was the seventh largest gathering in human history. Congratulations to the 2016 World Series champion Chicago Cubs. I want to send my thank you to Tom Ricketts, Theo Epstein, and Joe Maddon, the players, the fans, and everyone involved in making this the most unforgettable Cubs season. I yield back. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. RELIGIOUS FREEDOM Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, 1 year ago I came to the Senate floor for a series of eight speeches on a subject central to the identity and character of our country's religious freedom. As Congress unanimously declared less than two decades ago, religious freedom undergirds the very origin and existence of the United States. In that series of remarks, I started with the first principles to establish why religious freedom matters and must be given special protection. I reviewed the central role of religious freedom and the central role that religious freedom has played in shaping our country beginning long before independence. I have an example of how I phrased it on this chart. From the earliest settlers to the revolutionary generation, to the 19th century, to the modern day, religious freedom has been a driving force in American life. Without the quest for religious liberty, there would be no United States, and without the continued guarantee of religious freedom, there can be no American ideal. I also outlined the substance and status of religious freedom in America. In other words, I answered the questions of what religious freedom is and how important it is. From the pen of James Madison to the words of the First Amendment, from statutes to international treaties, religious freedom has [[Page S6395]] always been understood to include both belief and behavior in public and in private, collectively and individually. The status of the importance of religious freedom can be summed up in two words used repeatedly by America's Founders and leaders from the beginning: Religious freedom is both inalienable and preeminent. In last year's series of speeches, I also described the ways our government institutions are increasingly undermining religious freedom. These attacks come from, of course, the executive branch and even State legislatures, and they occur because our leaders have forgotten, ignored, or never really learned the fundamentals of religious freedom. A philosopher, George Santayana, wrote that ``those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.'' Put another way, as President Andrew Jackson warned as he left office, ``Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.'' ``You must pay the price,'' Jackson said, ``if you wish to secure the blessing.'' Unfortunately, we are no longer paying the price necessary to maintain this fundamental right. Either by negligence or intention, political forces in our society are radically changing what has been the very heart and soul of our great country. They want to restrict the substance of religious freedom so that it includes belief but not behavior; in private but not in public; individually but not collectively. They want to demote the status of religious freedom from inalienable and preeminent to optional and secondary. Examples abound in just the last several years. When the Obama administration and Democrats in Congress fashioned ObamaCare, for instance, they gave no thought to the law's impact on religious freedom. This is especially shocking given that Federal law required them to do so. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act sets a high standard for government actions that burden religious freedom and explicitly requires that Federal laws and regulations meet that standard. The Obama administration and congressional Democrats, however, ran roughshod over religious freedom in fashioning mandates and policies that force people to violate their deeply held religious beliefs. The Supreme Court has twice held that the birth control mandate in ObamaCare is incompatible with the protections for religious freedom that Congress previously and nearly unanimously enacted. Another example is before us today. Two years ago, President Obama issued a sweeping Executive order prohibiting Federal contractors and grant recipients from taking into account sexual orientation or gender identity when making employment decisions. The order itself is not a surprise. President Obama has been a supporter of LGBT rights throughout his Presidency and believes that gays and lesbians deserve the same job opportunities as everyone else. On that latter point, I-- along with most Americans--agree. What was remarkable about President Obama's order was that it contained no exemption for employers with religious affiliations. For years, laws prohibiting discrimination in employment and housing have routinely included religious liberty exemptions to protect religious organizations from having to take actions that contravene their beliefs. Such exemptions, for example, permit a religiously affiliated school that holds traditional views on marriage and human sexuality to offer married housing only to couples of the opposite sex or decline to hire as a faculty member an individual in a committed, same-sex relationship. These exemptions enable religious organizations to hold true to their beliefs while still complying with the law. President Obama's decision not to include a religious liberty exemption in his Executive order marked a sharp turn in the wrong direction. One year earlier, Senate Democrats had agreed to include a robust religious exemption in the Employment Nondiscrimination Act, or ENDA, a bill that would have prohibited sexual orientation discrimination in hiring by employers with at least 15 employees. ENDA's exemption tracked similar provisions in numerous State laws, including Utah's. Notwithstanding requests from religious groups, President Obama refused to include a similar exemption in his Executive order. His refusal means that a religious organization that wishes to compete for Federal funds may be forced to hire individuals who hold views or engage in conduct that contravenes the organization's religious beliefs. This is a direct attack on the ability of such organizations to preserve and promote their religious identity. Earlier this year, the House of Representatives took action to reverse the President's troubling refusal to protect religious employers. Back in May, the House passed the annual National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, to fund the Armed Forces. At the markup on the bill, Representative Steve Russell of Oklahoma offered, and the committee adopted, an amendment to the bill to clarify that religious organizations that contract with or receive grants from the Federal Government do not lose religious liberty. They do not lose religious liberty protections that they enjoy under other laws merely because they choose to work with the Federal Government. These protections, which are found in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Americans with Disabilities Act, include the ability to hire ``individuals of a particular religion to perform work connected with the [organization's] activities'' and to ``require that all applicants and employees conform to the [organization's] religious tenets.'' Such protections enable religious organizations to preserve their religious identity by hiring employees who share the organization's religious beliefs. Now, the Russell amendment affirms that religious organizations and schools enjoy these same protections when they contract with or receive grants from the Federal Government. The amendment embodies the commonsense, longstanding principle that religious organizations should not have to surrender control over their religious mission in order to interact with government. Unfortunately, there has been a lot of misinformation spread about the Russell amendment and what it does and does not do so let me take a moment to clear it up. Some have claimed the amendment would allow contractors to deny service to gays or lesbians or would enable any contractor who so wishes to make hiring decisions on the basis of religious beliefs. It would do no such thing. The amendment is limited only to hiring and employment practices and only to religiously affiliated corporations, associations, educational institutions, or societies, in conformance with the existing protections in the Civil Rights Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. The amendment clarifies that religious organizations do not lose religious liberty protections merely because they enter into contract with or receive grants from the Federal Government. That is it. We might think that a position reaffirming existing religious liberty protections would not raise eyebrows. Unfortunately, we would be wrong. President Obama swiftly expressed his opposition to the Russell amendment. Not only that, but he threatened to veto the entire NDAA, cutting off funding for the entire Department of Defense rather than allow the amendment to take effect. President Obama would rather shutter our Armed Forces than enable religious employers to select employees who share their particular values. Regrettably, the President has been joined in his opposition by 42 Senate Democrats who recently wrote a letter to the President outlining their ``strong opposition'' to the Russell amendment and asking the President to ``ensure that [the amendment] is removed from the final version of [the NDAA].'' The President and my Democratic colleagues are concerned, it seems, that if religious organizations that contract with the Federal Government are able to select employees who share the organization's religious beliefs, they may make decisions that liberals would disapprove of. For example, a religious family services charity may choose to hire individuals who hold traditional views on marriage and human sexuality. Because the President and my colleagues across the aisle do not share these views, they think religious organizations should be unable to take them into account when [[Page S6396]] seeking employees who will promote the organization's mission. It is difficult to imagine a position more at odds with our heritage of religious freedom. President Obama and Senate Democrats would empower the Federal Government to compel religious organizations to hire individuals who do not share the organization's religious beliefs. They would insert Federal tentacles into fundamental decisions regarding religious mission and identity. They would have the Federal Government declare off-limits traditional views on sexual orientation and gender identity that many Americans hold as a matter of religious conviction. But there is an even more pernicious aspect to the Democrats' position on this issue. Many liberals argue that claims of religious liberty are nothing more than a front for discrimination. They contend--with some force--that religious liberty claimants just don't like gay people or don't like women and use religion as a cover for their deep-seated animus toward disfavored groups. That is, of course, ridiculous. I would challenge anyone who holds this view to actually interact with a religious person. They will find, contrary to their own prejudices, that people of faith are loving, gracious, and polite and, more often than not, go out of their way to help the poor and the downtrodden. Religious believers don't treat others with kindness and charity despite their faith; they do so because of their faith. To my liberal friends, I say: Before you tar religious believers with whatever benighted stereotypes you see portrayed on TV and in the news media, get to know some of them. You will find your assumptions about them are totally wrong. Nevertheless, many liberals claim that religious liberty is a guise for discrimination. There is no reason, they say, for a religious organization or individual to seek an exemption from an otherwise equitable law, other than animus toward those the law is designed to protect. But what, then, are we to make of President Obama's Executive order and the left's reaction to the Russell amendment? President Obama could have included a religious liberty exemption in his order--such exemptions are standard in other laws, and numerous religious groups asked him to include one here--but he chose not to. Senate Democrats could easily have agreed to the Russell amendment, which does nothing more than reaffirm existing protections for religious employers--but they chose not to do so. What reason is there to exclude religious contractors and grant recipients from religious liberty protections that are otherwise generally available? Why single out such contractors and grant recipients for disfavor? It makes you wonder. Do my Democratic colleagues not see that the very argument they make against religious liberty can be turned against them? They are seeking to withdraw from religious contractors and grant recipients rights and protections that would otherwise be available under existing law. They are undermining the ability of believers to navigate between secular and spiritual demands. They are bringing to bear the sword of the State when they could easily stay their hand. It is difficult for me to look at the President's actions and those of my colleagues across the aisle and see anything other than discrimination against people of faith. They could give room for believers--as our Nation has done for centuries--but they choose not to. Rather, they cut and nip at religious liberty until all that remains is a hollow shell. I am left to wonder when the drive for equality became the drive to exclude and to undermine religion because that seems to be where we have arrived. Give a place for us, say people of faith. Allow us to live out our beliefs. We will abide the law, but we ask you to make reasonable accommodations. Surely a simple religious liberty exemption--indeed, one that is already part of our existing laws--would be reasonable. I close with an appeal to my Democratic colleagues. The outcome of the fight over the Russell amendment is not in doubt. Even if President Obama vetoes the NDAA or the Russell amendment is removed during conference, President Obama's Executive order will be withdrawn or else amended by the President-elect to include a religious liberty exemption. The Russell amendment will become law whether it is through congressional action or Executive order. The question for my colleagues across the aisle is whether they will stand up for the rights of religious contractors and grant recipients or whether they will join President Obama's losing battle against religious liberty. Will they protect people of faith or will they prosecute them? President Obama has cast his lot with the prosecution. It is not too late for my Democratic colleagues to choose a different course, and I hope and pray they will. These are not itty-bitty issues. These are issues that go right back to the core values of our country and our beliefs. Religious liberty is not something that can be cast aside. It is not something that should be cast aside. Religious liberty is a fundamental right, and we should not be playing around with it in the Congress. When there is prejudice and there is discrimination, that is another matter, but in virtually every case of religious liberty, I don't find that prejudice or discrimination. Our churches are a vibrant part of America, and we sure as heck ought to stand behind them and make sure religious liberty is always protected. I hope my colleagues will think these things through, I hope the 42 Democrats who voted to remove the Russell amendment will change their minds, and I hope they start to realize that religious freedom is not some itty-bitty thing. It is the thing in many respects that has been part of making America the greatest land in the world and the freest land in the world and the place where liberty includes real liberty. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I appear to be on the floor for Utah Day, with the junior Senator presiding and the senior Senator speaking. I am delighted to follow the senior Senator. I think in the boisterous days and months we will see ahead, his longstanding reputation for collegiality and reason and the respect in which his colleagues all hold him could become valuable attributes in our Senate. Climate Change Mr. President, I am here as the Senate reconvenes from the 2016 election recess to give my 149th climate speech, but I want first to congratulate my colleagues who were reelected and the new Members elected to the Senate and President-Elect Trump and Vice President- Elect Pence. With control of the White House and majorities coming in the House and the Senate, Republicans will wield great power in Washington, DC, and as the well-known saying goes, ``with great power comes great responsibility.'' In his acceptance speech, President-Elect Trump asked us all for help and guidance in governing this great Nation. My guidance would be first to be responsible. A key test will be whether our President-elect and Republicans here in the Senate choose to be responsible about climate change. I am gravely concerned about climate change, but based on the President-elect's campaign, he appears blissfully unconcerned, and Congress has been stalled by a decades-long industry-controlled campaign of calculated misinformation on the danger of carbon pollution and by just raw industry political pressure. But the President-elect will soon hear--and, hopefully, take it to heart--from a grownup world outside the creepy alt-right and the fossil fuel industry, a world of people who actually know what they are talking about. The President-elect will hear from our military and national security experts how deadly serious this is. Our former Pacific commander, Admiral Locklear, said it was the biggest national security threat we face in the Pacific theater. To use Admiral Locklear's exact words, ``climate change is probably the most likely thing that is going to happen . . . that will cripple the security environment, probably more likely than the other scenarios we all often talk about.'' Geoffrey Kemp, former Special Assistant to the President for National [[Page S6397]] Security Affairs under President Ronald Reagan, said: Our military and intelligence leadership have recognized, under both the George W. Bush and the Obama administrations, that climate change will present real and costly risks to our national security and that the effects are going to get worse if we don't do something about it very soon. As General Douglas MacArthur warned about the dangers of unpreparedness for war, we don't want to be too late. The President-elect will hear from our National Labs and from NOAA and NASA, the folks who put a rover on Mars and are driving it around and may know a little bit about real science, about the robust scientific consensus on climate change, and the urgency to change our course. If he doesn't trust our own scientific agencies, he can go to any major university in any State in the Nation and confirm what the government and military experts tell him. The President-elect will hear from world leaders who have pledged, alongside the United States, to work across borders to limit carbon emissions. The Paris Agreement brought nearly 200 countries together with the common goal of keeping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius and avoiding the most catastrophic outcomes for the planet and its people. He will also hear from CEOs across America, particularly those in the food and agriculture sectors who are living with climate change consequences every day, and from many others that we need to quit fooling around. I hope the President-elect will listen to these voices of reason and expertise. The people in our Nation certainly are listening. Polls show over 60 percent of Americans are concerned about global warming, and more than 80 percent of Americans favor action to reduce carbon pollution. Rhode Island, the Ocean State, would tell the administration that the oceans are the frontlines of climate change. The oceans have absorbed approximately 30 percent of the excess carbon dioxide that we have added to the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution--30 percent of it. They have also absorbed roughly 90 percent of the excess heat trapped in the atmosphere by those greenhouse gases. Without the oceans to absorb that added heat and carbon dioxide, we would not be worried about the 2-degree warming limit the world community is racing to avoid. We would be looking at a 30-degree increase, and life as our species knows it on this planet would be over. Oceans have spared us thus far from disaster, but what they have done to buffer our self-inflicted harm comes at its own cost. Global ocean temperatures are rising. In Rhode Island, Narragansett Bay's mean water temperature is up nearly 4 degrees Fahrenheit. Our Rhode Island lobster fishery is crashing, and our winter flounder fishery is gone. As water warms, of course, it also expands, and as glaciers melt, they add to the volume of the ocean. That is why sea levels are rising worldwide. The water is up about 10 inches at the Newport Naval Station tide gauge since the 1930s, and the Navy is actively planning how to defend the Norfolk Naval Station from rising seas. The effect of the ocean's absorbing all that carbon dioxide is a little different. It causes a chemical reaction. It is making ocean water more acidic. The ocean is acidifying and doing so at the fastest rate in 50 million years. Considering we have only been on the planet as a species for about 200,000 years, that is a long, long interval. Rhode Island's clammers, lobstermen, and aquaculture growers are watching with real alarm the damage acidified seas are doing. On America's northwest coast, oyster hatcheries have already experienced significant losses when their new hatches were unable to grow their shells in the acidified seawater. Off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and Northern California, 50 percent of ocean pteropods were measured to have ``severe shell damage,'' mostly from acidified seas. If that species collapses, the bottom falls out of the oceanic food chain. As the oceans go, so goes the planet. It is my sincere hope that President-Elect Trump will feel the call of history, of reason, and of patriotism to live up to the awesome responsibilities he now will bear. The 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, the so-called COP-22, is now taking place in Marrakech, Morocco. A similar gathering took place in Copenhagen 7 years ago. A full-page ad in the New York Times then called for passage of climate legislation in the United States for investment in the clean energy economy and for leadership to inspire the rest of the world to join the fight against climate change. It said: We must embrace the challenge today to ensure that future generations are left with a safe planet and a strong economy. . . . We support your effort-- They said to President Obama-- to ensure meaningful and effective measures to control climate change, an immediate challenge facing the United States and the world today. Please don't postpone the earth. If we fail to act now, it is scientifically irrefutable that there will be catastrophic and irreversible consequences for humanity and our planet. That full-page ad from which we took this was signed by Donald J. Trump, Chairman and President of the Trump organization. The signatories also included his children, Donald Jr., Eric, and Ivanka. Their future and their reputations are at stake too. The President-elect campaigned against big special interests controlling Washington, and he mocked Republican politicians groveling before the Koch brothers at their ``begathon,'' as he called it. He has a simple choice now. He can make his own decisions based on the best recommendations of our military, our national science laboratories, and our great universities, or he can fall in tow to the Koch brothers--the biggest special interest of them all. He can believe our National Labs and our National Aeronautics and Space Administration, or he can believe the National Enquirer. He can believe our military or he can believe the fossil fuel industry's denial apparatus. He can believe established scientific principles or he can believe fanciful conspiracy theories. His choice will be fateful, and the world and history will both be watching. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",package_114_207.csv,73648,73648,73722,"[congressional record volume 162, number 164 (wednesday, november 16, 2016)] [senate] [pages s6388-s6397] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] american energy and conservation act of 2016--motion to proceed the presiding officer. under the previous order, the senate will resume consideration of the motion to [[page s6389]] proceed to s. 3110, which the clerk will report. the senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: motion to proceed to calendar no. 543, s. 3110, a bill to provide for reforms of the administration of the outer continental shelf of the united states, to provide for the development of geothermal, solar, and wind energy on public land, and for other purposes. the presiding officer. the senator from florida. mr. nelson. mr. president, i want to speak on the bill. we are going to have a vote somewhere around midday tomorrow on this bill. this senator comes to this issue with a long history of drilling for oil off our coast. ever since i was a young congressman, i have been fighting to keep oil rigs off florida's coast. it is especially important at this time, as we have a new administration coming in that took a public position in the election declaring the intent of the president-elect to open up additional areas off the coast to oil drilling. the package that we are going to consider tomorrow is an enhancement of exactly that goal. i want to point out to the senate why this is not in the interest of our country now. first of all, we are dealing with a law that we passed about 5 or 6 years ago with an acronym of gomesa, which opened up for the first time oil revenues that came from federal waters to be shared with the gulf states. we were doing this primarily in the interests of louisiana because louisiana had been hit so hard by hurricane katrina, and there was a need to restore a lot of those marshes. this was another way of getting revenue to the state of louisiana. at the same time that bill was passed, it enhanced a law that we had passed with my former colleague senator mel martinez back in the 2006 timeframe that kept the oil drilling off florida in the gulf--and kept it off, and it is in law. it is the only place of the outer continental shelf where it is in law that you cannot drill up through the year 2022. i want to point out for the historical record why that is so and why this bill we are considering tomorrow is not in the interest of the country. this area in yellow is the gulf of mexico off of florida. this is florida, the peninsula, the keys. this is the gulf coast of florida. over here is pensacola. all of that area in yellow is off limits to drilling until the year 2022. why? well, it does not take a rocket scientist to realize what happened to florida's economy after the deep water horizon oil spill. the oil got as far as pensacola. the spill was over here off of louisiana. it got to the beaches of pensacola, some to destin, some tar balls to panama city, until the wind started sending it back the other way. but what happened to florida's tourism industry on its gulf coast for an entire season? the tourists thought there was oil on our beaches, and tourists did not come for an entire season all the way down to marco island, naples--all of those beautiful sugary white sand beaches, including the beaches of northwest florida. they did not come because they thought there was oil there. that did not just affect the airlines and the hotels. it affected the dry cleaners and the restaurants and all of the largest industry in florida, which is the tourism industry. that is one reason. another reason is that there are so many of the bays and estuaries along this gulf coast where the critters are hatched that supply the fish stocks for the entire gulf. of course, there are stocks that are hatched here that migrate out into the other oceans. but there is a third reason. that reason is that all of this area to the east of this line--in other words, 125 miles off panama city, 235 miles off tampa bay, even further off naples--all of that is the largest testing and training area in the world for the u.s. military. the department of defense has issued two letters under the signatures of two republican secretaries of defense saying that any oil-related activities here would be incompatible with our testing and training mission, this being the largest one in the united states. that is why we do not have drilling there. you will hear the proponents of the bill say: well, we have exempted this part. we have exempted it not only because it is off limits in law, but what they are doing to the rest of the gulf coast is almost doubling the revenue sharing that would go to the states, the gulf states, thereby giving even more incentive for the state governments to want to have drilling off of their coasts regardless of the u.s. military, regardless of the economic engine of florida, regardless of the very delicate environment. but there is more. as a matter of fact, the bill before us would offer revenue sharing to states. mind you, this is drilling in federal waters. any revenue would typically go to the federal government. as a matter of fact, it is estimated by cbo that it would be a loss of $7 billion to the u.s. treasury. that would also be available for the states on the atlantic. here is florida, georgia, south carolina, north carolina, virginia, maryland, new jersey, new york, and on up on the atlantic coast. i brought this chart to show not only the gulf area off of florida and the military testing and training ranges, but to look at the military testing and training ranges off the atlantic coast. if it is incompatible here, are we not going to hear, as we have heard from some in the department of defense, that it is going to be incompatible in the atlantic region? i want to urge that not only have we been battling to keep our coastal environments and beaches clean and unpolluted--that is not the only argument. the argument is also one of keeping our national security tested and trained in the most sophisticated weapons and training for the best military in the world. this senator is a senior member of the senate armed services committee. there is a reason that we do not have oil rigs out here. first of all, in the state of florida, we have tyndall air force base at panama city. that is where they are training our pilots on f-22s. at eglin air force base near fort walton beach, that is where about half of the u.s. air force training and the other services--the navy as well as the air force--are training their pilots for the f-35 that is now being cycled in to be the workhorse of our fighters. the u.s. navy, which will have f-35s but presently has f-18s, will fly a squadron to key west naval air station. they will be there for a week or two. when they lift off from the runway at boca chica key, in 2 minutes they could be over restricted airspace, not having spent a lot of time and fuel to get to the area of restriction for their testing and training. so the department of defense has said: you simply cannot have oil rigs operating in an area where we are testing these very sophisticated weapons systems--and they need a lot of space; from this location down here, this is some 300 miles--as well as the training that goes on. it is not just for the benefit of our military, it is key to our national defense. we have watched the tar balls wash up on the beaches. we have seen the sugary white sands of pensacola beach completely black, covered in oil. we saw the harm that was done to not only the local businesses that cater to tourists, such as the hotels, restaurants, and attractions, but to all the ancillary businesses, such as the drycleaners and the real estate firms. to put it into perspective, for our state of florida, this is a $50 billion industry that oils the engine of our economy. we are talking about generating some $700 million in sales tax revenue for the state, and it helps support more than 450,000 jobs throughout the state. why would you risk destroying a state's economy as well as our military preparation? it is not as if we don't have other places that we want to produce oil. think of the oil shale that has been tapped in the dakotas, in oklahoma, and in texas that is not producing at maximum capacity. as floridians, the images of the hazmat crews in those hazmat suits and the coast guard vessels skimming off the water just 6 years ago are emblazoned on our memories. our fishermen and our businesses certainly haven't forgotten their own losses that amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars. so if the new administration and the oil industry want to have a fight on in issue, well, they certainly have one. this senator is going to continue to try to keep the oil rigs off the state of florida with everything i have, for all of the reasons i have stated. [[page s6390]] when we vote tomorrow, i would commend to our colleagues to beware of all of the effects of almost doubling the revenue for the gulf coast states of texas, louisiana, mississippi, and alabama, which is at the heart of what is behind this particular bill we are going to vote on, but also beware there are hidden messages in this revenue sharing, and it strikes at the heart of what we have been trying to protect here-- the environment, our economy, and our u.s. military preparedness. i yield the floor. mr. president, i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. nelson. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. bringing people together mr. nelson. mr. president, as long as no other senator is asking to be recognized, let me just say that from the perspective of the senior senator from florida, i think it is the obligation of those of us who were backing the candidate who did not win the presidency--as president obama has said, the president-elect will be the president. it is incumbent upon the rest of us, regardless of party, to reach out and to try to help the new president on behalf of and for the sake of our country. this senator, who in four decades of public service has always tried to reach out in a bipartisan way and bring people together, to build consensus in order to govern, will continue to do so, and this senator greets the new administration with that statement. it is important that a statement like that be made, especially in this time where we are so rent asunder, where we are so divided, and where we have come through an election that has been--the only word i can think of is ``ugly.'' things were said in the ordinary course of conversation in this election that should not have been said. particularly as we try to heal the wounds of both sides and take back the awful things that were said and create an atmosphere where we can come together for the sake of our country, that is especially important, and this senator is going to contribute to that. it is my hope that it will be received on all sides and that we will reach out and try to bring people together. i think it is important to say that, particularly at a time where feelings have been hurt and feelings have been so high and so tense. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. cornyn. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. working together mr. cornyn. mr. president, we are living in historic times. the 115th congress will be the first time in a decade that republicans have held both chambers of congress and the white house. before the george w. bush administration in the early part of this century, you would have to go back to the eisenhower administration--i believe it was 1953--to find a comparable time of republican control. interestingly, for the history buffs who may be listening, there have actually been 14 times since 1945 when we have had single-party majorities in both houses and the white house. eleven of those times have been our democratic colleagues and three times have been republicans. so i come back to where i started in saying these are truly historic times. this morning, our republican conference met to elect our leadership team to serve in the next congress during this extraordinary time. after gaining the majority 2 years ago, it has been a pleasure to look back and see what we have been able to accomplish even with the president from the opposing party in the white house. yesterday i mentioned the rewrite of no child left behind, which sent more authority back to the states, parents, and teachers to make education decisions for children in kindergarten through 12th grade. i also mentioned passing a long-term highway bill for 5 years--something we hadn't been able to do for a long time. those are just two concrete examples of how, working together, we can tackle big, intractable problems. frankly, nothing happens in the senate unless it is bipartisan. we also passed some other important legislation, something negotiated by the majority leader in the house at the time, nancy pelosi, or leader pelosi, and speaker john boehner, which was the reform of our social security laws in terms of how doctors under medicare are paid. it is an important item because if doctors are not paid a prevailing fee or competitive fee for their services, they are simply not going to see medicare patients and seniors are not going to have access to the care they deserve. we passed a bill sanctioning north korea for its nuclear program and its human rights abuses. we also passed legislation to better support our troops, who fight and put themselves in harm's way to keep us safe every day. i am grateful to our republican colleagues for voting to continue the direction of progress for the american people by reelecting their current leadership, including the senior senator from kentucky, mr. mcconnell. as all of us have, i have had the honor to serve alongside senator mcconnell for several years now, although i have served for the last 4 years as the whip or the right hand of the majority leader when it comes to trying to corral votes and trying to promote our legislative agenda. i found the majority leader to be a wise and steady hand in a town marked by the absence of those virtues, among many. so i am proud to serve with him in the next congress, as i am with all of our colleagues, and in his case as the majority leader, as his assistant. we also had a chance, having come back together after the election, to talk about the future and to talk about our agenda going forward. yesterday i pointed out several legislative priorities at the top of the list--policy items we have to get right on behalf of the american people--such as confirming a supreme court justice who will interpret the laws as we write them and as the constitution is written, rather than as another policymaking branch of government. we have also promised we would repeal and replace obamacare, which was a failed experiment--failed because the president, when he promoted it, said: if you like what you have, you can keep it. he said: if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. and he said: an average family of four will see their premiums go down $2,500. none of that has been proven to be true. so it is very important we keep that promise of repealing obamacare and then replace it on a step-by-step basis over a transition period with more affordable health care that will preserve the choices in health care through americans and their families and not washington, dc. and then there is the matter of legislation. after our democratic friends lost their 60-vote majority in the senate and the republicans flipped the house, providing for a divided government, the one thing that has characterized the obama administration has been its executive actions and overregulation. in august, it was reported the president and his administration had issued 600 major regulations with a pricetag of more than $740 billion. if there is one thing i hear from my constituents back in texas-- small business owners and the like--it is that they are feeling the strangling effect of overregulation, along with the cost of compliance and the uncertainty that goes along with it. so it is no surprise to see that our economy has essentially flatlined and not been growing because none of this is good for the small business owners we are relying upon to create jobs and opportunities, and it is not good for american families looking for those jobs in order to provide for their families and simply put food on the table. so we are eager to roll back those expensive, and in many instances unnecessary, certainly in every instance burdensome regulations so the economy can have some breathing room and begin to grow again. many of us are interested in addressing tax reform as well. there is bipartisan consensus that our tax code is simply too complex and counterproductive. in fact, it is literally a self- [[page s6391]] inflicted wound when it comes to forcing $2 trillion-plus overseas that american-based companies would like to bring back, but the reason they do not is they would be subject to double taxation, first, in the country where the money has been earned and, secondly, when they bring it back to the united states. rather than do that, many of them will leave that money overseas. that means that rather than investing in american jobs and american infrastructure, they are literally investing in jobs overseas and in building infrastructure to support their facilities in other countries. that makes no sense whatsoever. so tax reform is high on our agenda. i believe, and i am optimistic, that at a time when everybody understands our tax code has simply gotten too complex, too expensive, and too counterproductive, we will be able to make some real progress. coming from a border state, i can tell you i am delighted to hear president elect trump talk about the importance of border security. in a post-9/11 world, it is simply critical we know who is coming into our country and make sure they do so only by legal means. so securing our border is something we need to deal with, and thank goodness there is no shortage of good ideas. chairman mike mccaul of the house homeland security committee has a bipartisan bill i think would make great progress along those lines, but obviously we are going to have to have an important discussion among all members of congress and the administration about how best to accomplish the goal. we also need to remember our ports of entry are where legitimate trade and travel occur, and we should do nothing to impede that because legitimate trade and travel are very important to our economy. the u.s. economy enjoys about 6 million jobs as a result of trade between the united states and mexico alone. so i look forward to working with the administration and with our colleagues to make sure we secure our border against illegal immigration, including human trafficking, drug trafficking, and the potential violence that goes along with that, while making sure our legitimate trade and travel at our ports of entry are supported so we can benefit from those as well. of course, as we debated earlier this congress, having an updated and efficient infrastructure is vital to the health and well-being of our economy. i mentioned the transportation bill we passed. a long-term transportation bill will provide for some of that, but certainly not all that is necessary. we need to take a look at the proposals the president-elect is going to send our way, but there is no shortage of good ideas being discussed both in the house and the senate as well. i look forward to learning more about those, but one thing that hasn't been talked about very much is how we are going to pay for it, and that is going to be an important item to discuss as well. frankly, we can't keep spending our kids' and grandkids' inheritance or at least forcing upon the younger generations the obligation to pay for bills we incur today. one of the things i hope will occur as a result of this historic election is that we will have the courage and the willingness to sit down and come up with structural solutions to our financial situation, which is $19 trillion-plus in debt. because of the federal reserve keeping interest rates very low, we are not having to pay huge amounts of money in order to service that debt or pay interest to the people who own that debt, but that is going to change if the federal reserve begins to raise interest rates, and we are going to find ourselves paying more and more money to service that debt to the bondholders and less and less of that money will be available for our priorities domestically, whether they be national security or other investments in things such as medical research and the like. so finding out how we can crack that nut and come together on a bipartisan basis, working with the white house to deal with our long- term fiscal problems and continuing to meet the needs of our nation are going to be challenging but exhilarating to do. many are talking about the next steps and what should and shouldn't happen in light of the new political reality, but what is clear to me today is that republicans are united by a strong desire to listen to the concerns of the american people and to deliver results--results that make their lives easier and our collective futures stronger. i want to say that as committed as the majority party is to that, we can't do this without the cooperation and consensus building that comes along as part of the legislative process. unfortunately, we have seen the last years characterized by obstruction and filibusters and blocking things that essentially have already received bipartisan support. i am talking particularly about the appropriations process. one of the terrible things that happened this last year in the congress is the appropriations committees have gotten back to work on a bipartisan basis. we would see bills coming out at a fiscally responsible level, with agreed-upon spending caps and democrats and republicans supporting them, only to see them dead on arrival on the floor of the senate. that is the kind of mindless obstructionism i hope we can avoid going forward. just from the conversations i have had as a result of this election, many of our democratic colleagues appear to be willing to work with us. certainly, with the new leadership on the democratic side of the aisle, i am more optimistic than i have been in a long time that we can come together while maintaining our strongly held convictions and principles--i am not talking about compromising those but rather working together when we can--and try to develop more ideas to better serve the american people. mr. president, i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. vitter. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. vitter. mr. president, i rise in strong support of s. 3110, the american energy and conservation act of 2016. this would increase revenue-sharing with the states for offshore oil and gas development. this legislation is scheduled for a vote on the senate floor tomorrow. i am pleased the senate is finally voting on this critical legislation, and i thank my colleague from louisiana, senator cassidy, for his lead and his hard work on this crucial issue. senator cassidy and i and several of our colleagues have worked hard over the years to bring this issue to the forefront and help both congress and the american people understand how important revenue-sharing is not only to louisiana, to other energy-producing states, but to the country and for the good of the country to expand american energy. i also thank leader mcconnell and chairman murkowski for working with us to bring this important bill to the floor for a vote. revenue sharing with oil- and gas-producing states is only fair, for two key reasons: first, energy-producing states incur real costs and real impacts from that production, including environmental, and second, revenue sharing is the most important way we can continue to incent domestic energy production over the long term in this country. it makes it fair and smart for our u.s. energy future. energy production is essential to job creation and an overall healthy economy. if it weren't for the oil and gas jobs that accompanied the energy sector boom earlier this decade, we would perhaps still be in a technical recession. one point i want to emphasize is that many of those jobs have been created by small firms in the oil and gas sector and support sectors. these small business energy jobs are something i have highlighted in my role as chair of the committee on small business and entrepreneurship, and they are vital in terms of the impact in this sector. this legislation would increase revenue sharing for the gulf states that produce energy offshore and would establish revenue sharing for new production off of alaska and off of virginia, north carolina, south carolina, and georgia. these are all areas that welcome the opportunity to have this revenue sharing to incent domestic energy production and increase the availability of american energy. [[page s6392]] contrary to what some have said, this legislation would not authorize any new offshore drilling. let me repeat. this legislation does not provide for new or expanded lease sales. this bill is about revenue sharing. let me be clear on what revenue sharing means for a state like louisiana, but there are many more. in louisiana, we spend 100 percent of these revenues on environmental concerns--specifically coastal restoration. we lose about a football field worth of land in coastal louisiana--just think of the football field you see every sunday in an nfl game; that amount of land just in coastal louisiana--every 38 minutes. that is 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 52 weeks a year, no time off for weekends, holidays, nothing. it is a constant loss. it is an environmental disaster. that is the most significant environmental issue by far that we face in our state. our state is committed to spending all of the money we receive from revenue sharing to restore, rebuild, and protect our coast. that is vitally important for louisiana, but it is also vitally important for the rest of the country because louisiana supplies so much energy that is good for america. let me be clear on what this legislation does. it expands revenue sharing to alaska and the mid-atlantic states, so it has impacts well beyond the gulf in a very positive way. beginning in 2027, alaska, virginia, north carolina, south carolina, and georgia would begin receiving 37.5 percent revenue sharing from oil and gas production off of their coasts, which is what louisiana, texas, alabama, and mississippi receive on new production there. it would also increase revenue sharing that those gulf states receive under the gulf of mexico energy security act of 2006, or gomesa. under that law, revenue sharing in those four gulf states is capped at $500 million per year between all of them, but beginning in 2027, that cap would increase substantially. that cap right now is completely arbitrary and far too low. revenue sharing is vital when it comes to adequately compensating states that help provide so much u.s. energy. it needs to be adequate if we are going to continue to incent those states to play that very important role in our u.s. economy. this legislation would help bring that objective to reality, and it is a critical component of a robust, strengthened revenue sharing regime for those major energy-producing states. i urge my colleagues to pass this important legislation. again, i thank everyone who has worked on this, starting with my colleague from louisiana, senator cassidy, who will be speaking on this topic immediately following me. with that, i welcome the senator's remarks. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from louisiana. mr. cassidy. mr. president, i wish to thank senator vitter for his support, his kind words, and his tireless effort over his senatorial career to highlight the fact that louisiana is losing so much land and there is something we need to do about it. i also thank majority leader mcconnell for following through on his commitment to allow a vote on the american energy and conservation act of 2016. this was introduced earlier this year by senators murkowski, scott, vitter, tillis, sullivan, and me. i thank each of them for their hard work. i also thank senators kaine and warner for helping draft the atlantic portion of the legislation and for cosponsoring an earlier version. as i just said, this is a bipartisan piece of legislation that uses an ``all of the above'' strategy to pursue true american energy independence. more than anything else, though, this legislation is about creating better jobs with better benefits. if there was one message we heard from this past election--if we actually listened to the american people, if we heard what they were saying, what we heard is that they want jobs that work for them, better jobs with better benefits. this helps accomplish that. for example, a study conducted by quest offshore resources, inc., projects that this legislation would incentivize the creation of 280,000 new jobs by 2035. that same study estimates $195 billion in new investments and an additional $51 billion in cumulative government revenue. that is $51 billion in new federal revenue that this bill helps unlock. it goes a long way to addressing our debt, deficit, and obligation to future generations. the american energy and conservation act will benefit american families and small businesses by expanding opportunities for states-- not just gulf coast but elsewhere--to support energy development. for years, energy activities in coastal gulf states and adjacent offshore waters have produced billions of barrels of oil and trillions of cubic feet of natural gas for american families. these states support offshore energy development for the rest of the country and provide the support and pay for the infrastructure needed to bring this energy to market. as with all development, there are increased costs associated with supporting increased traffic, additional use of local and state resources, as well as transportation corridors such as pipelines, vessels, and trucks to get this energy delivered to consumers across the united states. this bill is truly an ``all of the above'' energy jobs bill. this legislation includes language introduced by senators heller, heinrich, risch, and tester that streamlines the process for developing the renewable energy on public lands while establishing the first-ever revenue sharing paradigm for renewables. this legislation incentivizes tapping into the 27,000 megawatts of carbon-free energy that the bureau of land management estimates could be provided by these projects. furthermore, if offshore revenue exists for oil and gas development, the same should be true for offshore wind development. that is why we are using the same model established in gomesa to extend revenue sharing to states that support offshore wind projects. this legislation thus incentivizes developing some of the 4,233 gigawatts of carbon-free generation that the bureau of land management estimates is available for development off our coasts. this is the american energy and conservation act of 2016. this legislation makes significant investments in conservation projects all over the united states. this legislation provides an additional $807 million for projects that increase access to public lands for hunting, fishing, and other outdoor recreational activities. this particular provision was included in senator murkowski's bipartisan sportsmen's act of 2015, which 24 senators have cosponsored. the legislation makes investments in a variety of important programs, including the payment in lieu of taxes program. this legislation is supported by over 50 important stakeholder groups, including the national association of manufacturers, the u.s. chamber of commerce, the american chemistry council, the american petroleum institute, and the consumer energy alliance. these organizations understand that this legislation is a jobs builder and good policy for american workers. mr. president, i urge my colleagues to support this legislation, the american energy and conservation act of 2016. i yield back. mr. vitter. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. cotton. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. remembering jack shatford mr. cotton. mr. president, my arkansan of the week is jack shatford, and the recognition is both honorary and, sadly, posthumous. jack passed away last month during one of his many hunting trips to arkansas. he loved our state and its people, and we all miss him badly. jack first got to know arkansas on the other side of the world in vietnam. jack and my dad len served together in the same infantry squad in vietnam in 1969 and 1970. they became closest of friends, a friendship that only grew over nearly a half century. jack was from missouri, so he and dad were able to see each other regularly, often on deer-hunting trips in [[page s6393]] arkansas and duck- and goose-hunting trips in missouri. he became like the brother my dad never had, a second son to my grandparents and aunt pood. jack also got to know my mom avis, just as my mom and dad got to know jack's wife joy. over time, my sister and i came along and jack and joy became like an aunt and uncle to us, just like my parents felt about kurt, jack and joy's son. some of my oldest memories are traveling to missouri to see the shatfords at places like six flags, silver dollar city, and branson and seeing how happy and excited my dad was in the days leading up to jack's visits to arkansas. jack was a lifelong hunter and outdoorsman. he worked for 34 years at the missouri department of conservation. if it flew, ran, or swam, you can pretty much bet that jack knew how to find it, track it, kill it, and cook it. in fact, i have to confess that jack probably put more meat on the cotton family table than my dad ever did. he taught me a lot of lessons as well, not just about the outdoors but about life. jack helped me see some things through my dad's eyes, and i figure he probably did the same thing for my dad. their example from vietnam contributed to my decision to join the army. that wasn't an easy time in the cotton household, believe me, but jack was there to help smooth things over, and he encouraged me all along the way. jack was a patriot. he had put his life on the line to defend the country we love so much. i know from my dad's war stories that jack was fearless and brave, but he was also gentle and outgoing, the kind of guy who makes fast friends. he sure made a lot of friends in dardanelle where he was like an adopted son. he even belonged to our yell county wildlife federation. above all, though, jack was a loving family man, a devoted husband to joy, and father to kurt and his wife mary, and jack was a doting grandpa to sarah and shelby. they will miss jack as we all miss him so dearly. the pain hasn't gone away yet. it will not for a while, and it may never go away, but with the pain, we ought to be swelled with pride and gratitude to have known and loved such a fine man. jack shatford, rest in peace and follow me. funding our military mr. president, the world may be more unstable than ever. the security architecture we built after world war ii is at risk. our parents and grandparents fought to keep the world free from a conflict between major powers. they created order out of the chaos of world war and genocide. they protected our freedom and ensured that our democratic ideals would be the dominant power in the world. the foundation of that order is the u.s. military. since they toppled nazi germany and imperial japan, they held firm against the north korean assault on the democratic south. they faced down a powerful soviet union through decades of cold war. they liberated kuwait and have shed blood and sweat for over a decade, keeping america safe from islamic terrorism. today our military is composed solely of volunteers. we don't press our people into service. they choose to serve. since the draft was abolished, we have had a basic compact with our men and women in uniform. in exchange for their service, we ensure that they have the best training, equipment, and leadership america has to offer. we make certain that if our troops must face the enemy, they are equipped to meet the task. with regret, i must say this compact is fraying and we are failing in our duty to our military. today the armed forces face a growing number of threats and a shrinking budget. russia is resurgent. they don't think they lost the cold war, only that they were behind at halftime. russia's invasion and occupation of ukraine and georgia make it clear that moscow seeks to dominate its so-called near abroad. moscow wants to divide the great atlantic alliance, viewing the confederation of democracies as a threat to the power and authority of a putin government. their bombers probe our airspace in ways unseen since the cold war. they recently sent a carrier fleet through the english channel. they probe our electronic defenses with daily cyber attacks and rattle the sabre of their nuclear arsenal at the west. china has also risen. they have sought to establish military control over the east and south china seas. china also probes and attacks american servers, stealing vital military and industrial secrets. china has quadrupled its defense spending in the past few years, seeking control of the pacific rim. north korea is growing a nuclear arsenal and developing the capability to hit any american city with those nuclear bombs. iran continues to violate the terms of its nuclear agreement and is the world's worst state sponsor of terrorism. just last month, iranian- backed rebels fired chinese anti-ship missiles at an american warship. had it not been for the skill of the crew and our modern defenses, sailors may have come home in boxes. in afghanistan, we lost 15 servicemembers in 2016. they continue to fight daily, protecting americans from the threat of a resurgent terrorist threat. how do we repay their service? we have cut their budget by over $1 trillion. we have told them to do more with less. we have ignored their needs, long and repeated deployments, and brutal operations tempo. we have cut their pay, forced them to sail on rickety ships, and told them to fly on aircraft so old they date back to the truman and eisenhower administrations. this neglect has taken its toll. in january, 12 marines died in a helicopter crash. low readiness and subpar flying hours were to blame. last week, six green berets were killed in 72 hours. they died in three separate incidents, stretching from the continental united states to jordan, to afghanistan. the air force is 4,000 airmen short of what is needed to maintain their fleet, and they are 700 pilots short to fly that fleet. they are salvaging parts from scrap yards to keep their aircraft flying. since may, five f-18 hornets and super hornets have crashed, killing two pilots and destroying all five jets. in the army, just 30 percent of brigade combat teams are properly trained and equipped to fight. the navy has had to defer maintenance for combat ships, leaving them more dangerous for the crews. we are wrong to ask our military to work and risk their lives under these conditions, and we cannot wait until the next fiscal year to fix this crisis because this is a crisis. this is no way to treat our troops and the military needs relief now. i will soon introduce a $26 billion emergency spending request, a lifeline to our overworked warfighters. the funds will be used to address immediate needs in military readiness and overseas operations. they will give our warfighters critical relief in these trying times. they will help keep our men and women in uniform safe as we ask them to do an increasingly dangerous job. i ask my colleagues to put aside old debates and do what is right for our armed forces. they are the ones risking their lives daily, not us. they are the ones out on the front lines defending our country, not us. they are the ones begging for help, and we are the ones obligated to provide it. mr. president, i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. mccain. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer (mr. gardner). without objection, it is so ordered. working together mr. mccain. mr. president, it has been the great privilege and honor of my life to represent the people of arizona in the senate. i am humbled that in last tuesday's election they placed their trust in me for another term. since i first came to this body, i have never taken that trust for granted, and i never will. i will get up every day for the next 6 years determined to work harder than the day before for the people of arizona. of course, mine was not the only election last tuesday. the american people did their civic duty and chose a [[page s6394]] new president. i congratulate the president-elect. my prayers are with him and his family as he prepares to assume our nation's highest office, and i will do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges confronting our nation. this was a long and difficult national election and not always an uplifting one. i know there were many americans who were disappointed on election night, and we have seen some of that disappointment in the protests that have taken place in several cities across the nation. some of those protesters have even taken to using the slogan ``not my president.'' this is misguided. i have been on the losing side of elections before, and it is no fun. but america has only one president at a time. we do not have to agree with the president on every issue, and when we do disagree, we should express ourselves in the spirit of mutual respect that is essential for a free and democratic people. therefore, i urge all americans to offer our next president good will and an earnest effort to find ways to come together to make necessary compromises to grow our economy, defend our security, and leave future generations a stronger, better america. that better america is one in which we never forget that whatever our differences, we are all americans. we must respect our common citizenship by treating each other with respect. that is why i have been so disturbed by reports of increased acts of intimidation, harassment, and even violence directed at minority, racial, and religious groups in the aftermath of this election. prejudice and hate have no place in america. such behavior is a betrayal of who we are as a people and all that we aspire to be. to those who have committed these disgusting acts, i repeat the words of the president-elect: stop it. with the campaign over, it is time for all of us to go about the work the american people sent us here to do, and there is a lot of work to do. for too long, washington has schemed, fought, and maneuvered to gain political advantage at the cost of delivering for the american people. the predictable result is that we have made little, if any, progress toward meeting the great challenges of our time and too many americans feel left out and left behind. this election made clear that americans are fed up with business as usual in washington, and they want us to make progress now on solving national problems that threaten their ability to prosper and make a better life for their families. they want progress now on growing the economy and increasing their opportunities to live purposeful and satisfying lives. they want progress now to secure their families and america's interests from the dangerous threats we face overseas. as chairman of the senate armed services committee, america's national security and the men and women in uniform who protect it will be my top priorities. we have to put an end to business as usual at the pentagon, where the largest government agency cannot pass a financial audit and where a broken acquisitions system is too often plagued by cost overruns, schedule delays, and poor performance. we have to put an end to sequestration once and for all and return to a strategy-based defense budget. it gives our servicemembers the resources, training, and equipment they need to meet current and future threats. we have to accelerate the defeat of isil in iraq and syria and continue to take the fight to radical islamist terrorists who seek to attack our homeland. above all, we must remain the free world's leader and stand up always and everywhere for the values that make us exceptional and to which all people are entitled: the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. we have to reinvigorate america's alliances around the world, not discard them in favor of cynical deals with adversaries who want us to relinquish our global leadership. we have to enhance shared efforts to deter and, if necessary, defeat aggression from whatever power threatens our interests and values. achieving these goals will require a team at the department of defense composed of the best people our nation has to offer. the senate armed services committee stands ready to receive nominations from the new president. the stakes for our nation are high. so too must be our standards. america has many challenges ahead, but none of us should despair of our present difficulties. instead, we must believe always in the promise and greatness of america. i still do. in that spirit, my promise is this: to work as hard as i ever have; to use all my knowledge, experience, and relationships; and to work with our new president and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to solve our problems together as fellow americans. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer (mr. lee). the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. kirk. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. congratulating the chicago cubs on winning the world series mr. kirk. mr. president, i rise to offer congratulations to the 2016 world series champion chicago cubs, who are being congratulated in a resolution that i did with my colleague senator durbin. for 100 years, it seemed fitting that we would overcome the daunting three games to one to win the series. many times i have said that any team can have a bad century, like 108 years. one of the most painful moments we have had as cubs fans is watching the 1969 cubs when we always knew we were going to beat the amazing mets. i remember the names: the late ron santo, the late ernie banks, fergie jenkins, and billy williams. they were up nine games on the mets but collapsed at the end of the season. in 2016, the cubs blew away the 1969 record and went all the way. they removed the curse of the billy goat and the black cat. that toughness exemplifies the can-do spirit of the people of illinois. no one deserves this championship more than the best baseball fans in the country, the cubs fans. i also want to give a real shout-out to world series mvp ben zobrist. following the victory, i had the honor of riding in the victory parade. over 5 million chicagoans came to watch. i understand from the press that this was the seventh largest gathering in human history. congratulations to the 2016 world series champion chicago cubs. i want to send my thank you to tom ricketts, theo epstein, and joe maddon, the players, the fans, and everyone involved in making this the most unforgettable cubs season. i yield back. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. hatch. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. religious freedom mr. hatch. mr. president, 1 year ago i came to the senate floor for a series of eight speeches on a subject central to the identity and character of our country's religious freedom. as congress unanimously declared less than two decades ago, religious freedom undergirds the very origin and existence of the united states. in that series of remarks, i started with the first principles to establish why religious freedom matters and must be given special protection. i reviewed the central role of religious freedom and the central role that religious freedom has played in shaping our country beginning long before independence. i have an example of how i phrased it on this chart. from the earliest settlers to the revolutionary generation, to the 19th century, to the modern day, religious freedom has been a driving force in american life. without the quest for religious liberty, there would be no united states, and without the continued guarantee of religious freedom, there can be no american ideal. i also outlined the substance and status of religious freedom in america. in other words, i answered the questions of what religious freedom is and how important it is. from the pen of james madison to the words of the first amendment, from statutes to international treaties, religious freedom has [[page s6395]] always been understood to include both belief and behavior in public and in private, collectively and individually. the status of the importance of religious freedom can be summed up in two words used repeatedly by america's founders and leaders from the beginning: religious freedom is both inalienable and preeminent. in last year's series of speeches, i also described the ways our government institutions are increasingly undermining religious freedom. these attacks come from, of course, the executive branch and even state legislatures, and they occur because our leaders have forgotten, ignored, or never really learned the fundamentals of religious freedom. a philosopher, george santayana, wrote that ``those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.'' put another way, as president andrew jackson warned as he left office, ``eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.'' ``you must pay the price,'' jackson said, ``if you wish to secure the blessing.'' unfortunately, we are no longer paying the price necessary to maintain this fundamental right. either by negligence or intention, political forces in our society are radically changing what has been the very heart and soul of our great country. they want to restrict the substance of religious freedom so that it includes belief but not behavior; in private but not in public; individually but not collectively. they want to demote the status of religious freedom from inalienable and preeminent to optional and secondary. examples abound in just the last several years. when the obama administration and democrats in congress fashioned obamacare, for instance, they gave no thought to the law's impact on religious freedom. this is especially shocking given that federal law required them to do so. the religious freedom restoration act sets a high standard for government actions that burden religious freedom and explicitly requires that federal laws and regulations meet that standard. the obama administration and congressional democrats, however, ran roughshod over religious freedom in fashioning mandates and policies that force people to violate their deeply held religious beliefs. the supreme court has twice held that the birth control mandate in obamacare is incompatible with the protections for religious freedom that congress previously and nearly unanimously enacted. another example is before us today. two years ago, president obama issued a sweeping executive order prohibiting federal contractors and grant recipients from taking into account sexual orientation or gender identity when making employment decisions. the order itself is not a surprise. president obama has been a supporter of lgbt rights throughout his presidency and believes that gays and lesbians deserve the same job opportunities as everyone else. on that latter point, i-- along with most americans--agree. what was remarkable about president obama's order was that it contained no exemption for employers with religious affiliations. for years, laws prohibiting discrimination in employment and housing have routinely included religious liberty exemptions to protect religious organizations from having to take actions that contravene their beliefs. such exemptions, for example, permit a religiously affiliated school that holds traditional views on marriage and human sexuality to offer married housing only to couples of the opposite sex or decline to hire as a faculty member an individual in a committed, same-sex relationship. these exemptions enable religious organizations to hold true to their beliefs while still complying with the law. president obama's decision not to include a religious liberty exemption in his executive order marked a sharp turn in the wrong direction. one year earlier, senate democrats had agreed to include a robust religious exemption in the employment nondiscrimination act, or enda, a bill that would have prohibited sexual orientation discrimination in hiring by employers with at least 15 employees. enda's exemption tracked similar provisions in numerous state laws, including utah's. notwithstanding requests from religious groups, president obama refused to include a similar exemption in his executive order. his refusal means that a religious organization that wishes to compete for federal funds may be forced to hire individuals who hold views or engage in conduct that contravenes the organization's religious beliefs. this is a direct attack on the ability of such organizations to preserve and promote their religious identity. earlier this year, the house of representatives took action to reverse the president's troubling refusal to protect religious employers. back in may, the house passed the annual national defense authorization act, or ndaa, to fund the armed forces. at the markup on the bill, representative steve russell of oklahoma offered, and the committee adopted, an amendment to the bill to clarify that religious organizations that contract with or receive grants from the federal government do not lose religious liberty. they do not lose religious liberty protections that they enjoy under other laws merely because they choose to work with the federal government. these protections, which are found in the civil rights act of 1964 and the americans with disabilities act, include the ability to hire ``individuals of a particular religion to perform work connected with the [organization's] activities'' and to ``require that all applicants and employees conform to the [organization's] religious tenets.'' such protections enable religious organizations to preserve their religious identity by hiring employees who share the organization's religious beliefs. now, the russell amendment affirms that religious organizations and schools enjoy these same protections when they contract with or receive grants from the federal government. the amendment embodies the commonsense, longstanding principle that religious organizations should not have to surrender control over their religious mission in order to interact with government. unfortunately, there has been a lot of misinformation spread about the russell amendment and what it does and does not do so let me take a moment to clear it up. some have claimed the amendment would allow contractors to deny service to gays or lesbians or would enable any contractor who so wishes to make hiring decisions on the basis of religious beliefs. it would do no such thing. the amendment is limited only to hiring and employment practices and only to religiously affiliated corporations, associations, educational institutions, or societies, in conformance with the existing protections in the civil rights act and the americans with disabilities act. the amendment clarifies that religious organizations do not lose religious liberty protections merely because they enter into contract with or receive grants from the federal government. that is it. we might think that a position reaffirming existing religious liberty protections would not raise eyebrows. unfortunately, we would be wrong. president obama swiftly expressed his opposition to the russell amendment. not only that, but he threatened to veto the entire ndaa, cutting off funding for the entire department of defense rather than allow the amendment to take effect. president obama would rather shutter our armed forces than enable religious employers to select employees who share their particular values. regrettably, the president has been joined in his opposition by 42 senate democrats who recently wrote a letter to the president outlining their ``strong opposition'' to the russell amendment and asking the president to ``ensure that [the amendment] is removed from the final version of [the ndaa].'' the president and my democratic colleagues are concerned, it seems, that if religious organizations that contract with the federal government are able to select employees who share the organization's religious beliefs, they may make decisions that liberals would disapprove of. for example, a religious family services charity may choose to hire individuals who hold traditional views on marriage and human sexuality. because the president and my colleagues across the aisle do not share these views, they think religious organizations should be unable to take them into account when [[page s6396]] seeking employees who will promote the organization's mission. it is difficult to imagine a position more at odds with our heritage of religious freedom. president obama and senate democrats would empower the federal government to compel religious organizations to hire individuals who do not share the organization's religious beliefs. they would insert federal tentacles into fundamental decisions regarding religious mission and identity. they would have the federal government declare off-limits traditional views on sexual orientation and gender identity that many americans hold as a matter of religious conviction. but there is an even more pernicious aspect to the democrats' position on this issue. many liberals argue that claims of religious liberty are nothing more than a front for discrimination. they contend--with some force--that religious liberty claimants just don't like gay people or don't like women and use religion as a cover for their deep-seated animus toward disfavored groups. that is, of course, ridiculous. i would challenge anyone who holds this view to actually interact with a religious person. they will find, contrary to their own prejudices, that people of faith are loving, gracious, and polite and, more often than not, go out of their way to help the poor and the downtrodden. religious believers don't treat others with kindness and charity despite their faith; they do so because of their faith. to my liberal friends, i say: before you tar religious believers with whatever benighted stereotypes you see portrayed on tv and in the news media, get to know some of them. you will find your assumptions about them are totally wrong. nevertheless, many liberals claim that religious liberty is a guise for discrimination. there is no reason, they say, for a religious organization or individual to seek an exemption from an otherwise equitable law, other than animus toward those the law is designed to protect. but what, then, are we to make of president obama's executive order and the left's reaction to the russell amendment? president obama could have included a religious liberty exemption in his order--such exemptions are standard in other laws, and numerous religious groups asked him to include one here--but he chose not to. senate democrats could easily have agreed to the russell amendment, which does nothing more than reaffirm existing protections for religious employers--but they chose not to do so. what reason is there to exclude religious contractors and grant recipients from religious liberty protections that are otherwise generally available? why single out such contractors and grant recipients for disfavor? it makes you wonder. do my democratic colleagues not see that the very argument they make against religious liberty can be turned against them? they are seeking to withdraw from religious contractors and grant recipients rights and protections that would otherwise be available under existing law. they are undermining the ability of believers to navigate between secular and spiritual demands. they are bringing to bear the sword of the state when they could easily stay their hand. it is difficult for me to look at the president's actions and those of my colleagues across the aisle and see anything other than discrimination against people of faith. they could give room for believers--as our nation has done for centuries--but they choose not to. rather, they cut and nip at religious liberty until all that remains is a hollow shell. i am left to wonder when the drive for equality became the drive to exclude and to undermine religion because that seems to be where we have arrived. give a place for us, say people of faith. allow us to live out our beliefs. we will abide the law, but we ask you to make reasonable accommodations. surely a simple religious liberty exemption--indeed, one that is already part of our existing laws--would be reasonable. i close with an appeal to my democratic colleagues. the outcome of the fight over the russell amendment is not in doubt. even if president obama vetoes the ndaa or the russell amendment is removed during conference, president obama's executive order will be withdrawn or else amended by the president-elect to include a religious liberty exemption. the russell amendment will become law whether it is through congressional action or executive order. the question for my colleagues across the aisle is whether they will stand up for the rights of religious contractors and grant recipients or whether they will join president obama's losing battle against religious liberty. will they protect people of faith or will they prosecute them? president obama has cast his lot with the prosecution. it is not too late for my democratic colleagues to choose a different course, and i hope and pray they will. these are not itty-bitty issues. these are issues that go right back to the core values of our country and our beliefs. religious liberty is not something that can be cast aside. it is not something that should be cast aside. religious liberty is a fundamental right, and we should not be playing around with it in the congress. when there is prejudice and there is discrimination, that is another matter, but in virtually every case of religious liberty, i don't find that prejudice or discrimination. our churches are a vibrant part of america, and we sure as heck ought to stand behind them and make sure religious liberty is always protected. i hope my colleagues will think these things through, i hope the 42 democrats who voted to remove the russell amendment will change their minds, and i hope they start to realize that religious freedom is not some itty-bitty thing. it is the thing in many respects that has been part of making america the greatest land in the world and the freest land in the world and the place where liberty includes real liberty. mr. president, i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from rhode island. mr. whitehouse. mr. president, i appear to be on the floor for utah day, with the junior senator presiding and the senior senator speaking. i am delighted to follow the senior senator. i think in the boisterous days and months we will see ahead, his longstanding reputation for collegiality and reason and the respect in which his colleagues all hold him could become valuable attributes in our senate. climate change mr. president, i am here as the senate reconvenes from the 2016 election recess to give my 149th climate speech, but i want first to congratulate my colleagues who were reelected and the new members elected to the senate and president-elect trump and vice president- elect pence. with control of the white house and majorities coming in the house and the senate, republicans will wield great power in washington, dc, and as the well-known saying goes, ``with great power comes great responsibility.'' in his acceptance speech, president-elect trump asked us all for help and guidance in governing this great nation. my guidance would be first to be responsible. a key test will be whether our president-elect and republicans here in the senate choose to be responsible about climate change. i am gravely concerned about climate change, but based on the president-elect's campaign, he appears blissfully unconcerned, and congress has been stalled by a decades-long industry-controlled campaign of calculated misinformation on the danger of carbon pollution and by just raw industry political pressure. but the president-elect will soon hear--and, hopefully, take it to heart--from a grownup world outside the creepy alt-right and the fossil fuel industry, a world of people who actually know what they are talking about. the president-elect will hear from our military and national security experts how deadly serious this is. our former pacific commander, admiral locklear, said it was the biggest national security threat we face in the pacific theater. to use admiral locklear's exact words, ``climate change is probably the most likely thing that is going to happen . . . that will cripple the security environment, probably more likely than the other scenarios we all often talk about.'' geoffrey kemp, former special assistant to the president for national [[page s6397]] security affairs under president ronald reagan, said: our military and intelligence leadership have recognized, under both the george w. bush and the obama administrations, that climate change will present real and costly risks to our national security and that the effects are going to get worse if we don't do something about it very soon. as general douglas macarthur warned about the dangers of unpreparedness for war, we don't want to be too late. the president-elect will hear from our national labs and from noaa and nasa, the folks who put a rover on mars and are driving it around and may know a little bit about real science, about the robust scientific consensus on climate change, and the urgency to change our course. if he doesn't trust our own scientific agencies, he can go to any major university in any state in the nation and confirm what the government and military experts tell him. the president-elect will hear from world leaders who have pledged, alongside the united states, to work across borders to limit carbon emissions. the paris agreement brought nearly 200 countries together with the common goal of keeping global warming below 2 degrees celsius and avoiding the most catastrophic outcomes for the planet and its people. he will also hear from ceos across america, particularly those in the food and agriculture sectors who are living with climate change consequences every day, and from many others that we need to quit fooling around. i hope the president-elect will listen to these voices of reason and expertise. the people in our nation certainly are listening. polls show over 60 percent of americans are concerned about global warming, and more than 80 percent of americans favor action to reduce carbon pollution. rhode island, the ocean state, would tell the administration that the oceans are the frontlines of climate change. the oceans have absorbed approximately 30 percent of the excess carbon dioxide that we have added to the atmosphere since the industrial revolution--30 percent of it. they have also absorbed roughly 90 percent of the excess heat trapped in the atmosphere by those greenhouse gases. without the oceans to absorb that added heat and carbon dioxide, we would not be worried about the 2-degree warming limit the world community is racing to avoid. we would be looking at a 30-degree increase, and life as our species knows it on this planet would be over. oceans have spared us thus far from disaster, but what they have done to buffer our self-inflicted harm comes at its own cost. global ocean temperatures are rising. in rhode island, narragansett bay's mean water temperature is up nearly 4 degrees fahrenheit. our rhode island lobster fishery is crashing, and our winter flounder fishery is gone. as water warms, of course, it also expands, and as glaciers melt, they add to the volume of the ocean. that is why sea levels are rising worldwide. the water is up about 10 inches at the newport naval station tide gauge since the 1930s, and the navy is actively planning how to defend the norfolk naval station from rising seas. the effect of the ocean's absorbing all that carbon dioxide is a little different. it causes a chemical reaction. it is making ocean water more acidic. the ocean is acidifying and doing so at the fastest rate in 50 million years. considering we have only been on the planet as a species for about 200,000 years, that is a long, long interval. rhode island's clammers, lobstermen, and aquaculture growers are watching with real alarm the damage acidified seas are doing. on america's northwest coast, oyster hatcheries have already experienced significant losses when their new hatches were unable to grow their shells in the acidified seawater. off the coasts of washington, oregon, and northern california, 50 percent of ocean pteropods were measured to have ``severe shell damage,'' mostly from acidified seas. if that species collapses, the bottom falls out of the oceanic food chain. as the oceans go, so goes the planet. it is my sincere hope that president-elect trump will feel the call of history, of reason, and of patriotism to live up to the awesome responsibilities he now will bear. the 22nd session of the conference of the parties to the u.n. framework convention on climate change, the so-called cop-22, is now taking place in marrakech, morocco. a similar gathering took place in copenhagen 7 years ago. a full-page ad in the new york times then called for passage of climate legislation in the united states for investment in the clean energy economy and for leadership to inspire the rest of the world to join the fight against climate change. it said: we must embrace the challenge today to ensure that future generations are left with a safe planet and a strong economy. . . . we support your effort-- they said to president obama-- to ensure meaningful and effective measures to control climate change, an immediate challenge facing the united states and the world today. please don't postpone the earth. if we fail to act now, it is scientifically irrefutable that there will be catastrophic and irreversible consequences for humanity and our planet. that full-page ad from which we took this was signed by donald j. trump, chairman and president of the trump organization. the signatories also included his children, donald jr., eric, and ivanka. their future and their reputations are at stake too. the president-elect campaigned against big special interests controlling washington, and he mocked republican politicians groveling before the koch brothers at their ``begathon,'' as he called it. he has a simple choice now. he can make his own decisions based on the best recommendations of our military, our national science laboratories, and our great universities, or he can fall in tow to the koch brothers--the biggest special interest of them all. he can believe our national labs and our national aeronautics and space administration, or he can believe the national enquirer. he can believe our military or he can believe the fossil fuel industry's denial apparatus. he can believe established scientific principles or he can believe fanciful conspiracy theories. his choice will be fateful, and the world and history will both be watching. thank you, mr. president. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. mcconnell. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer (mr. tillis). without objection, it is so ordered.

CREC-2016-11-16-pt1-PgS6398,CREC-2016-11-16,114,BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6398-S6402] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to submit to the Senate the budget scorekeeping report for November 2016. The report compares current law levels of spending and revenues with the amounts the Senate agreed to in the budget resolution for fiscal year 2016, the conference report to accompany S. Con. Res. 11, and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, P.L. 114-74, BBA 15. This information is necessary for the Senate Budget Committee to determine whether budget points of order lie against pending legislation. It has been prepared by the Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee and the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, pursuant to section 308(b) of the Congressional Budget Act, CBA. This is the seventh report I have made this calendar year. It is the fourth report since I filed the statutorily required fiscal year 2017 enforceable budget limits on April 18, 2016, pursuant to section 102 of BBA 15, and the 11th report I have made since adoption of the fiscal year 2016 budget resolution on May 5, 2015. My last filing can be found in the Record on September 8, 2016. The information contained in this report for fiscal year 2017 and beyond is current through November 14, 2016. This is the final report I will file this year that provides fiscal year 2016-specific data, as that fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. Tables 1-7 of this report are prepared by my staff on the Budget Committee. While there are no changes to Tables 4, 6, and 7 from the last report, legislative activities by authorizing committees, table 1, and the Senate Committee on Appropriations, tables 2, 3, and 5, have made changes to budgetary levels. Table 1 gives the amount by which each Senate authorizing committee exceeds or is below its allocation for budget authority and outlays under the fiscal year 2016 budget resolution and the fiscal year 2017 enforceable budget levels filing. This information is used for enforcing committee allocations pursuant to section 302 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, CBA. Enforceable levels charged to authorizing committees for fiscal year 2016 remain unchanged from the last scorekeeping report, as budget authority remains below assumed levels by $51 million and outlays are $2.7 billion above allowable levels. The remaining enforceable levels have all changed since the last report. Notably, over the fiscal year 2017-2026 period, authorizing committees have approved $550 million in new budget authority and $505 million in outlays higher than allowable levels. During the last work period, Congress approved two bills with significant direct spending increases, the West Los Angeles Leasing Act of 2016, H.R. 5936, P.L. 114-226, and Treatment of Certain Payments in Eugenics Compensation Act, S. 1698, P.L. 114-241. Over 10 years, the former increased budget authority by $44 million and outlays by $18 million, and the latter increased both budget authority and outlays by $4 million. Table 2 gives the amount by which the Senate Committee on Appropriations exceeds or is below the statutory spending limits for fiscal year 2016. This information is used to determine points of order related to the spending caps found in section 312 and section 314 of the CBA. On September 29, the Continuing Appropriations and Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017, was signed into law, P.L. 114-223. Included in that bill as an offset for supplemental Zika funding was a provision that rescinded $168 million in budget authority for fiscal year 2016 from funds provided in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. This rescission, which was not designated as an emergency, had the effect of reducing regular nonsecurity discretionary funding charged to the Appropriations Committee by $168 million. Table 3 tracks the same enforcement information as Table 2 for fiscal year 2017. The continuing resolution included full-year appropriations for military construction and veterans affairs programs. As such, that funding has been scored against the discretionary caps, leaving $543.1 billion and $414.8 billion in budget authority for security and nonsecurity discretionary spending, respectively, for the remainder of fiscal year 2017. Table 5 tracks compliance with the fiscal year 2016 limit for overall changes in mandatory programs in appropriations bills, CHIMPS, established in the fiscal year 2016 budget resolution. This information is used for determining points of order under section 3103 of that resolution. The $168 million rescission in the CR, discussed above, is classified as a CHIMP; therefore, it is scored against the overall limit of $19.1 billion. In total, the Committee on Appropriations will be under the CHIMP limit by $1.1 billion. In addition to the tables provided by the Senate Budget Committee Republican staff, I am submitting additional tables from CBO, which I will use for enforcement of budget totals agreed to by the Congress. CBO provided a report both for fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2017. This information is used to enforce aggregate spending levels in budget resolutions under section 311 of the CBA. CBO's estimates show that current law levels of spending for fiscal year 2016 exceed the amounts in last year's budget resolution by $138.7 billion in budget authority and $103.6 billion in outlays. Revenues are $155.2 billion below the revenue floor for fiscal year 2016 set by the budget resolution. As well, Social Security outlays are at the levels assumed for fiscal year 2016, while Social Security revenues are $23 million below levels in the budget. For fiscal year 2017, CBO annualizes the temporary effects of the Continuing Appropriations and Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017, which provides funding through December 9, 2016. For the enforcement of budgetary aggregates, the Senate Budget Committee excludes this temporary funding. As such, the committee views current law levels as being $952.4 billion and $582.9 billion below budget resolution levels for budget authority and outlays, respectively. Revenues are $199 million above the level assumed in the budget resolution. Finally, Social Security outlays and revenues are at the levels assumed in the fiscal year 2017 enforcement filing for this budget year. CBO's report also provides information needed to enforce the Senate's pay-as-you-go rule. As part of the fiscal year 2017 enforcement filing, the Senate's pay-as-you-go scorecard was reset to zero. Since my last filing, legislative activity has resulted in an increase in the deficit of $74 million over the fiscal year 2016-2021 period, but deficit reduction of $35 million over the fiscal year 2016-2026 period. Over the initial 6-year period, Congress has enacted legislation that increased outlays by $482 million and revenues by $408 million. Over the 11-year period, outlays were increased by $505 million and revenues by $544 million. The Senate's pay-as-you-go rule is enforced by section 201 of S. Con. Res. 21, the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution. Finally, there is one new entry in the enforcement table included at the end of this submission, which tracks the Senate's budget enforcement activity on the floor. On September 14, 2016, a Senate PAYGO budget point of order, [[Page S6399]] section 201(a) of S. Con Res. 21, 110th Congress, was raised against the Water Resources Development Act of 2016, S. Amdt. 4979, for increasing the deficit by nearly $300 million over the fiscal year 2016-2026 period. This point of order was waived through a motion from Senator Inhofe by a vote of 85-12. While the point of order was waived, the bill has yet to clear both houses of Congress, and, as such, its budgetary effects remain unrecorded for enforcement purposes. All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years. I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: TABLE 1.--SENATE AUTHORIZING COMMITTEES--ENACTED DIRECT SPENDING ABOVE (+) OR BELOW (-) BUDGET RESOLUTIONS [In millions of dollars] ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 2016 2017 2017-2021 2017-2026 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Budget Authority.......... 0 0 0 0 Outlays................... 0 0 0 0 Armed Services Budget Authority.......... -66 0 0 0 Outlays................... -50 0 0 0 Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Budget Authority.......... 0 0 0 0 Outlays................... 0 0 0 0 Commerce, Science, and Transportation Budget Authority.......... 130 -3 -33 -8 Outlays................... 0 -3 -33 -8 Energy and Natural Resources Budget Authority.......... 0 200 365 370 Outlays................... 0 200 365 370 Environment and Public Works Budget Authority.......... 2,880 2 72 212 Outlays................... 252 1 57 193 Finance Budget Authority.......... 365 0 0 0 Outlays................... 365 0 0 0 Foreign Relations Budget Authority.......... 0 0 0 0 Outlays................... 0 0 0 0 Homeland Security and Government Affairs Budget Authority.......... 0 3 3 4 Outlays................... 0 3 3 4 Judiciary Budget Authority.......... -3,358 -9 102 -72 Outlays................... 1,713 -9 102 -72 Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Budget Authority.......... 0 0 0 0 Outlays................... 0 0 0 0 Rules and Administration Budget Authority.......... 0 0 0 0 Outlays................... 0 0 0 0 Intelligence Budget Authority.......... 0 0 0 0 Outlays................... 0 0 0 0 Veterans' Affairs Budget Authority.......... -2 -1 22 44 Outlays................... 388 -1 -12 18 Indian Affairs Budget Authority.......... 0 0 0 0 Outlays................... 0 0 0 0 Small Business Budget Authority.......... 0 0 0 0 Outlays................... 1 0 0 0 ----------------------------------------- Total Budget Authority...... -51 192 531 550 Outlays............... 2,669 191 482 505 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ TABLE 2.--SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE--ENACTED REGULAR DISCRETIONARY APPROPRIATIONS \1\ [Budget authority, in millions of dollars] ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 2016 --------------------------------- Security \2\ Nonsecurity \2\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Statutory Discretionary Limits........ 548,091 518,491 Amount Provided by Senate Appropriations Subcommittee Agriculture, Rural Development, and 0 21,750 Related Agencies.....................

Hon. Mike Enzi, Chairman, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: The enclosed report shows the effects of Congressional action on the fiscal year 2016 budget and is current through September 30, 2016. This report is submitted under section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act, as amended. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of S. Con. Res. 11, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2016. Since our last letter dated September 8, 2016, the Congress has cleared and the President has signed the Continuing Appropriations and Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017, and Zika Response and Preparedness Act (Public Law 114-223). That act had significant effects on budget authority in fiscal year 2016. Sincerely, Keith Hall, Director. Enclosure.

CBO estimated that: Division B would result in an additional $1,108 million in budget authority in fiscal year 2016 for emergency requirements; Section 145 of Division C would result in an additional $500 million in budget authority in fiscal year 2016 for disaster relief; and Division D would result in decreases in budget authority in fiscal year 2016 of $232 million for emergency requirements, and of $168 million for amounts not designated pursuant to section 251(b)(2) of the Deficit Control Act. d For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the Senate, the resolution, as approved by the Senate, does not include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a result, current level does not include these items. e Periodically, the Senate Committee on the Budget revises the budgetary levels in S.

Division C of P.L. 114-223, the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2017, provides funding through December 9, 2016; those amounts are shown in the ``Continuing Resolution'' portion of this table. In addition, certain provisions included in Divisions B-D of P.L. 114-223 provide supplemental appropriations for fiscal year 2016 which would result in additional outlays in fiscal year 2017 within the jurisdiction of various subcommittees. CBO estimates that: Division B would result in an additional $344 million in outlays in fiscal year 2017 from funding for emergency requirements; Section 145 of Division C would result in an additional $1 million in outlays in fiscal year 2017 from funding for emergency requirements and an additional $10 million from funding for disaster relief; and Division D would result in a decrease of $34 million in outlays in fiscal year 2017 from funding for emergency requirements. b Emergency funding that was not designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 shall not count for certain budgetary enforcement purposes.

This funding, which was not offset, would be used to combat the Zika virus. c This amendment designated $7.7 billion in outlays as being for emergency purposes. This funding, which was not offset, would be used to extend the Veterans Choice Program. d In its estimate for PROMESA, the Congressional Budget Office found that the bill would impose a number of mandates on the territorial government of Puerto Rico and its instrumentalities. The costs of these mandates on public entities would exceed the annual threshold in UMRA for intergovernmental mandates ($77 million in 2016, adjusted annually for inflation). e This amendment, as amended, triggered multiple points of order for increases in direct spending over all enforceable time periods. In particular, the amendment increased deficits by $299 million over the 2016-2026 period. f Unless otherwise noted, the motion to waive was offered pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6398-S6402] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to submit to the Senate the budget scorekeeping report for November 2016. The report compares current law levels of spending and revenues with the amounts the Senate agreed to in the budget resolution for fiscal year 2016, the conference report to accompany S. Con. Res. 11, and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, P.L. 114-74, BBA 15. This information is necessary for the Senate Budget Committee to determine whether budget points of order lie against pending legislation. It has been prepared by the Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee and the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, pursuant to section 308(b) of the Congressional Budget Act, CBA. This is the seventh report I have made this calendar year. It is the fourth report since I filed the statutorily required fiscal year 2017 enforceable budget limits on April 18, 2016, pursuant to section 102 of BBA 15, and the 11th report I have made since adoption of the fiscal year 2016 budget resolution on May 5, 2015. My last filing can be found in the Record on September 8, 2016. The information contained in this report for fiscal year 2017 and beyond is current through November 14, 2016. This is the final report I will file this year that provides fiscal year 2016-specific data, as that fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. Tables 1-7 of this report are prepared by my staff on the Budget Committee. While there are no changes to Tables 4, 6, and 7 from the last report, legislative activities by authorizing committees, table 1, and the Senate Committee on Appropriations, tables 2, 3, and 5, have made changes to budgetary levels. Table 1 gives the amount by which each Senate authorizing committee exceeds or is below its allocation for budget authority and outlays under the fiscal year 2016 budget resolution and the fiscal year 2017 enforceable budget levels filing. This information is used for enforcing committee allocations pursuant to section 302 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, CBA. Enforceable levels charged to authorizing committees for fiscal year 2016 remain unchanged from the last scorekeeping report, as budget authority remains below assumed levels by $51 million and outlays are $2.7 billion above allowable levels. The remaining enforceable levels have all changed since the last report. Notably, over the fiscal year 2017-2026 period, authorizing committees have approved $550 million in new budget authority and $505 million in outlays higher than allowable levels. During the last work period, Congress approved two bills with significant direct spending increases, the West Los Angeles Leasing Act of 2016, H.R. 5936, P.L. 114-226, and Treatment of Certain Payments in Eugenics Compensation Act, S. 1698, P.L. 114-241. Over 10 years, the former increased budget authority by $44 million and outlays by $18 million, and the latter increased both budget authority and outlays by $4 million. Table 2 gives the amount by which the Senate Committee on Appropriations exceeds or is below the statutory spending limits for fiscal year 2016. This information is used to determine points of order related to the spending caps found in section 312 and section 314 of the CBA. On September 29, the Continuing Appropriations and Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017, was signed into law, P.L. 114-223. Included in that bill as an offset for supplemental Zika funding was a provision that rescinded $168 million in budget authority for fiscal year 2016 from funds provided in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. This rescission, which was not designated as an emergency, had the effect of reducing regular nonsecurity discretionary funding charged to the Appropriations Committee by $168 million. Table 3 tracks the same enforcement information as Table 2 for fiscal year 2017. The continuing resolution included full-year appropriations for military construction and veterans affairs programs. As such, that funding has been scored against the discretionary caps, leaving $543.1 billion and $414.8 billion in budget authority for security and nonsecurity discretionary spending, respectively, for the remainder of fiscal year 2017. Table 5 tracks compliance with the fiscal year 2016 limit for overall changes in mandatory programs in appropriations bills, CHIMPS, established in the fiscal year 2016 budget resolution. This information is used for determining points of order under section 3103 of that resolution. The $168 million rescission in the CR, discussed above, is classified as a CHIMP; therefore, it is scored against the overall limit of $19.1 billion. In total, the Committee on Appropriations will be under the CHIMP limit by $1.1 billion. In addition to the tables provided by the Senate Budget Committee Republican staff, I am submitting additional tables from CBO, which I will use for enforcement of budget totals agreed to by the Congress. CBO provided a report both for fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2017. This information is used to enforce aggregate spending levels in budget resolutions under section 311 of the CBA. CBO's estimates show that current law levels of spending for fiscal year 2016 exceed the amounts in last year's budget resolution by $138.7 billion in budget authority and $103.6 billion in outlays. Revenues are $155.2 billion below the revenue floor for fiscal year 2016 set by the budget resolution. As well, Social Security outlays are at the levels assumed for fiscal year 2016, while Social Security revenues are $23 million below levels in the budget. For fiscal year 2017, CBO annualizes the temporary effects of the Continuing Appropriations and Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017, which provides funding through December 9, 2016. For the enforcement of budgetary aggregates, the Senate Budget Committee excludes this temporary funding. As such, the committee views current law levels as being $952.4 billion and $582.9 billion below budget resolution levels for budget authority and outlays, respectively. Revenues are $199 million above the level assumed in the budget resolution. Finally, Social Security outlays and revenues are at the levels assumed in the fiscal year 2017 enforcement filing for this budget year. CBO's report also provides information needed to enforce the Senate's pay-as-you-go rule. As part of the fiscal year 2017 enforcement filing, the Senate's pay-as-you-go scorecard was reset to zero. Since my last filing, legislative activity has resulted in an increase in the deficit of $74 million over the fiscal year 2016-2021 period, but deficit reduction of $35 million over the fiscal year 2016-2026 period. Over the initial 6-year period, Congress has enacted legislation that increased outlays by $482 million and revenues by $408 million. Over the 11-year period, outlays were increased by $505 million and revenues by $544 million. The Senate's pay-as-you-go rule is enforced by section 201 of S. Con. Res. 21, the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution. Finally, there is one new entry in the enforcement table included at the end of this submission, which tracks the Senate's budget enforcement activity on the floor. On September 14, 2016, a Senate PAYGO budget point of order, [[Page S6399]] section 201(a) of S. Con Res. 21, 110th Congress, was raised against the Water Resources Development Act of 2016, S. Amdt. 4979, for increasing the deficit by nearly $300 million over the fiscal year 2016-2026 period. This point of order was waived through a motion from Senator Inhofe by a vote of 85-12. While the point of order was waived, the bill has yet to clear both houses of Congress, and, as such, its budgetary effects remain unrecorded for enforcement purposes. All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years. I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: TABLE 1.--SENATE AUTHORIZING COMMITTEES--ENACTED DIRECT SPENDING ABOVE (+) OR BELOW (-) BUDGET RESOLUTIONS [In millions of dollars] ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 2016 2017 2017-2021 2017-2026 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Budget Authority.......... 0 0 0 0 Outlays................... 0 0 0 0 Armed Services Budget Authority.......... -66 0 0 0 Outlays................... -50 0 0 0 Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Budget Authority.......... 0 0 0 0 Outlays................... 0 0 0 0 Commerce, Science, and Transportation Budget Authority.......... 130 -3 -33 -8 Outlays................... 0 -3 -33 -8 Energy and Natural Resources Budget Authority.......... 0 200 365 370 Outlays................... 0 200 365 370 Environment and Public Works Budget Authority.......... 2,880 2 72 212 Outlays................... 252 1 57 193 Finance Budget Authority.......... 365 0 0 0 Outlays................... 365 0 0 0 Foreign Relations Budget Authority.......... 0 0 0 0 Outlays................... 0 0 0 0 Homeland Security and Government Affairs Budget Authority.......... 0 3 3 4 Outlays................... 0 3 3 4 Judiciary Budget Authority.......... -3,358 -9 102 -72 Outlays................... 1,713 -9 102 -72 Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Budget Authority.......... 0 0 0 0 Outlays................... 0 0 0 0 Rules and Administration Budget Authority.......... 0 0 0 0 Outlays................... 0 0 0 0 Intelligence Budget Authority.......... 0 0 0 0 Outlays................... 0 0 0 0 Veterans' Affairs Budget Authority.......... -2 -1 22 44 Outlays................... 388 -1 -12 18 Indian Affairs Budget Authority.......... 0 0 0 0 Outlays................... 0 0 0 0 Small Business Budget Authority.......... 0 0 0 0 Outlays................... 1 0 0 0 ----------------------------------------- Total Budget Authority...... -51 192 531 550 Outlays............... 2,669 191 482 505 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ TABLE 2.--SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE--ENACTED REGULAR DISCRETIONARY APPROPRIATIONS \1\ [Budget authority, in millions of dollars] ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 2016 --------------------------------- Security \2\ Nonsecurity \2\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Statutory Discretionary Limits........ 548,091 518,491 Amount Provided by Senate Appropriations Subcommittee Agriculture, Rural Development, and 0 21,750 Related Agencies.....................

Hon. Mike Enzi, Chairman, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: The enclosed report shows the effects of Congressional action on the fiscal year 2016 budget and is current through September 30, 2016. This report is submitted under section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act, as amended. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of S. Con. Res. 11, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2016. Since our last letter dated September 8, 2016, the Congress has cleared and the President has signed the Continuing Appropriations and Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017, and Zika Response and Preparedness Act (Public Law 114-223). That act had significant effects on budget authority in fiscal year 2016. Sincerely, Keith Hall, Director. Enclosure.

However, it was estimated that it would decrease revenues below the levels assumed in the budget resolution. b This amendment designated $1.1 billion in outlays as being for emergency purposes. This funding, which was not offset, would be used to combat the Zika virus. c This amendment designated $7.7 billion in outlays as being for emergency purposes. This funding, which was not offset, would be used to extend the Veterans Choice Program. d In its estimate for PROMESA, the Congressional Budget Office found that the bill would impose a number of mandates on the territorial government of Puerto Rico and its instrumentalities. The costs of these mandates on public entities would exceed the annual threshold in UMRA for intergovernmental mandates ($77 million in 2016, adjusted annually for inflation). e This amendment, as amended, triggered multiple points of order for increases in direct spending over all enforceable time periods. In particular, the amendment increased deficits by $299 million over the 2016-2026 period. f Unless otherwise noted, the motion to waive was offered pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6398-S6402] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT Mr. ENZI.

This is the seventh report I have made this calendar year. It is the fourth report since I filed the statutorily required fiscal year 2017 enforceable budget limits on April 18, 2016, pursuant to section 102 of BBA 15, and the 11th report I have made since adoption of the fiscal year 2016 budget resolution on May 5, 2015. My last filing can be found in the Record on September 8, 2016. The information contained in this report for fiscal year 2017 and beyond is current through November 14, 2016. This is the final report I will file this year that provides fiscal year 2016-specific data, as that fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. Tables 1-7 of this report are prepared by my staff on the Budget Committee. While there are no changes to Tables 4, 6, and 7 from the last report, legislative activities by authorizing committees, table 1, and the Senate Committee on Appropriations, tables 2, 3, and 5, have made changes to budgetary levels. Table 1 gives the amount by which each Senate authorizing committee exceeds or is below its allocation for budget authority and outlays under the fiscal year 2016 budget resolution and the fiscal year 2017 enforceable budget levels filing. This information is used for enforcing committee allocations pursuant to section 302 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, CBA. Enforceable levels charged to authorizing committees for fiscal year 2016 remain unchanged from the last scorekeeping report, as budget authority remains below assumed levels by $51 million and outlays are $2.7 billion above allowable levels. The remaining enforceable levels have all changed since the last report. Notably, over the fiscal year 2017-2026 period, authorizing committees have approved $550 million in new budget authority and $505 million in outlays higher than allowable levels. During the last work period, Congress approved two bills with significant direct spending increases, the West Los Angeles Leasing Act of 2016, H.R. 5936, P.L. 114-226, and Treatment of Certain Payments in Eugenics Compensation Act, S. 1698, P.L. 114-241. Over 10 years, the former increased budget authority by $44 million and outlays by $18 million, and the latter increased both budget authority and outlays by $4 million. Table 2 gives the amount by which the Senate Committee on Appropriations exceeds or is below the statutory spending limits for fiscal year 2016. This information is used to determine points of order related to the spending caps found in section 312 and section 314 of the CBA. On September 29, the Continuing Appropriations and Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017, was signed into law, P.L. 114-223. Included in that bill as an offset for supplemental Zika funding was a provision that rescinded $168 million in budget authority for fiscal year 2016 from funds provided in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. This rescission, which was not designated as an emergency, had the effect of reducing regular nonsecurity discretionary funding charged to the Appropriations Committee by $168 million. Table 3 tracks the same enforcement information as Table 2 for fiscal year 2017. The continuing resolution included full-year appropriations for military construction and veterans affairs programs. As such, that funding has been scored against the discretionary caps, leaving $543.1 billion and $414.8 billion in budget authority for security and nonsecurity discretionary spending, respectively, for the remainder of fiscal year 2017. Table 5 tracks compliance with the fiscal year 2016 limit for overall changes in mandatory programs in appropriations bills, CHIMPS, established in the fiscal year 2016 budget resolution. This information is used for determining points of order under section 3103 of that resolution. The $168 million rescission in the CR, discussed above, is classified as a CHIMP; therefore, it is scored against the overall limit of $19.1 billion. In total, the Committee on Appropriations will be under the CHIMP limit by $1.1 billion. In addition to the tables provided by the Senate Budget Committee Republican staff, I am submitting additional tables from CBO, which I will use for enforcement of budget totals agreed to by the Congress. CBO provided a report both for fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2017. This information is used to enforce aggregate spending levels in budget resolutions under section 311 of the CBA. CBO's estimates show that current law levels of spending for fiscal year 2016 exceed the amounts in last year's budget resolution by $138.7 billion in budget authority and $103.6 billion in outlays. Revenues are $155.2 billion below the revenue floor for fiscal year 2016 set by the budget resolution. As well, Social Security outlays are at the levels assumed for fiscal year 2016, while Social Security revenues are $23 million below levels in the budget. For fiscal year 2017, CBO annualizes the temporary effects of the Continuing Appropriations and Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017, which provides funding through December 9, 2016. For the enforcement of budgetary aggregates, the Senate Budget Committee excludes this temporary funding. As such, the committee views current law levels as being $952.4 billion and $582.9 billion below budget resolution levels for budget authority and outlays, respectively. Revenues are $199 million above the level assumed in the budget resolution. Finally, Social Security outlays and revenues are at the levels assumed in the fiscal year 2017 enforcement filing for this budget year. CBO's report also provides information needed to enforce the Senate's pay-as-you-go rule. As part of the fiscal year 2017 enforcement filing, the Senate's pay-as-you-go scorecard was reset to zero. Since my last filing, legislative activity has resulted in an increase in the deficit of $74 million over the fiscal year 2016-2021 period, but deficit reduction of $35 million over the fiscal year 2016-2026 period. Over the initial 6-year period, Congress has enacted legislation that increased outlays by $482 million and revenues by $408 million. Over the 11-year period, outlays were increased by $505 million and revenues by $544 million. The Senate's pay-as-you-go rule is enforced by section 201 of S. Con. Res. 21, the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution. Finally, there is one new entry in the enforcement table included at the end of this submission, which tracks the Senate's budget enforcement activity on the floor. On September 14, 2016, a Senate PAYGO budget point of order, [[Page S6399]] section 201(a) of S. Con Res. 21, 110th Congress, was raised against the Water Resources Development Act of 2016, S. Amdt. 4979, for increasing the deficit by nearly $300 million over the fiscal year 2016-2026 period. This point of order was waived through a motion from Senator Inhofe by a vote of 85-12. While the point of order was waived, the bill has yet to clear both houses of Congress, and, as such, its budgetary effects remain unrecorded for enforcement purposes. All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years. I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: TABLE 1.--SENATE AUTHORIZING COMMITTEES--ENACTED DIRECT SPENDING ABOVE (+) OR BELOW (-) BUDGET RESOLUTIONS [In millions of dollars] ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 2016 2017 2017-2021 2017-2026 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Budget Authority.......... 0 0 0 0 Outlays................... 0 0 0 0 Armed Services Budget Authority.......... -66 0 0 0 Outlays................... -50 0 0 0 Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Budget Authority.......... 0 0 0 0 Outlays................... 0 0 0 0 Commerce, Science, and Transportation Budget Authority.......... 130 -3 -33 -8 Outlays................... 0 -3 -33 -8 Energy and Natural Resources Budget Authority.......... 0 200 365 370 Outlays................... 0 200 365 370 Environment and Public Works Budget Authority.......... 2,880 2 72 212 Outlays................... 252 1 57 193 Finance Budget Authority.......... 365 0 0 0 Outlays................... 365 0 0 0 Foreign Relations Budget Authority.......... 0 0 0 0 Outlays................... 0 0 0 0 Homeland Security and Government Affairs Budget Authority.......... 0 3 3 4 Outlays................... 0 3 3 4 Judiciary Budget Authority.......... -3,358 -9 102 -72 Outlays................... 1,713 -9 102 -72 Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Budget Authority.......... 0 0 0 0 Outlays................... 0 0 0 0 Rules and Administration Budget Authority.......... 0 0 0 0 Outlays................... 0 0 0 0 Intelligence Budget Authority.......... 0 0 0 0 Outlays................... 0 0 0 0 Veterans' Affairs Budget Authority.......... -2 -1 22 44 Outlays................... 388 -1 -12 18 Indian Affairs Budget Authority.......... 0 0 0 0 Outlays................... 0 0 0 0 Small Business Budget Authority.......... 0 0 0 0 Outlays................... 1 0 0 0 ----------------------------------------- Total Budget Authority...... -51 192 531 550 Outlays............... 2,669 191 482 505 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ TABLE 2.--SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE--ENACTED REGULAR DISCRETIONARY APPROPRIATIONS \1\ [Budget authority, in millions of dollars] ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 2016 --------------------------------- Security \2\ Nonsecurity \2\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Statutory Discretionary Limits........ 548,091 518,491 Amount Provided by Senate Appropriations Subcommittee Agriculture, Rural Development, and 0 21,750 Related Agencies.....................

Hon. Mike Enzi, Chairman, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: The enclosed report shows the effects of Congressional action on the fiscal year 2016 budget and is current through September 30, 2016. This report is submitted under section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act, as amended. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of S. Con. Res. 11, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2016. Since our last letter dated September 8, 2016, the Congress has cleared and the President has signed the Continuing Appropriations and Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017, and Zika Response and Preparedness Act (Public Law 114-223). That act had significant effects on budget authority in fiscal year 2016. Sincerely, Keith Hall, Director. Enclosure.

CBO estimated that: Division B would result in an additional $1,108 million in budget authority in fiscal year 2016 for emergency requirements; Section 145 of Division C would result in an additional $500 million in budget authority in fiscal year 2016 for disaster relief; and Division D would result in decreases in budget authority in fiscal year 2016 of $232 million for emergency requirements, and of $168 million for amounts not designated pursuant to section 251(b)(2) of the Deficit Control Act. d For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the Senate, the resolution, as approved by the Senate, does not include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a result, current level does not include these items. e Periodically, the Senate Committee on the Budget revises the budgetary levels in S.

Division C of P.L. 114-223, the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2017, provides funding through December 9, 2016; those amounts are shown in the ``Continuing Resolution'' portion of this table. In addition, certain provisions included in Divisions B-D of P.L. 114-223 provide supplemental appropriations for fiscal year 2016 which would result in additional outlays in fiscal year 2017 within the jurisdiction of various subcommittees. CBO estimates that: Division B would result in an additional $344 million in outlays in fiscal year 2017 from funding for emergency requirements; Section 145 of Division C would result in an additional $1 million in outlays in fiscal year 2017 from funding for emergency requirements and an additional $10 million from funding for disaster relief; and Division D would result in a decrease of $34 million in outlays in fiscal year 2017 from funding for emergency requirements. b Emergency funding that was not designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 shall not count for certain budgetary enforcement purposes.

However, it was estimated that it would decrease revenues below the levels assumed in the budget resolution. b This amendment designated $1.1 billion in outlays as being for emergency purposes. This funding, which was not offset, would be used to combat the Zika virus. c This amendment designated $7.7 billion in outlays as being for emergency purposes. This funding, which was not offset, would be used to extend the Veterans Choice Program. d In its estimate for PROMESA, the Congressional Budget Office found that the bill would impose a number of mandates on the territorial government of Puerto Rico and its instrumentalities. The costs of these mandates on public entities would exceed the annual threshold in UMRA for intergovernmental mandates ($77 million in 2016, adjusted annually for inflation). e This amendment, as amended, triggered multiple points of order for increases in direct spending over all enforceable time periods. In particular, the amendment increased deficits by $299 million over the 2016-2026 period. f Unless otherwise noted, the motion to waive was offered pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. ____________________",package_114_207.csv,46636,46636,46710,"[congressional record volume 162, number 164 (wednesday, november 16, 2016)] [senate] [pages s6398-s6402] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] budget scorekeeping report mr. enzi. mr. president, i wish to submit to the senate the budget scorekeeping report for november 2016. the report compares current law levels of spending and revenues with the amounts the senate agreed to in the budget resolution for fiscal year 2016, the conference report to accompany s. con. res. 11, and the bipartisan budget act of 2015, p.l. 114-74, bba 15. this information is necessary for the senate budget committee to determine whether budget points of order lie against pending legislation. it has been prepared by the republican staff of the senate budget committee and the congressional budget office, cbo, pursuant to section 308(b) of the congressional budget act, cba. this is the seventh report i have made this calendar year. it is the fourth report since i filed the statutorily required fiscal year 2017 enforceable budget limits on april 18, 2016, pursuant to section 102 of bba 15, and the 11th report i have made since adoption of the fiscal year 2016 budget resolution on may 5, 2015. my last filing can be found in the record on september 8, 2016. the information contained in this report for fiscal year 2017 and beyond is current through november 14, 2016. this is the final report i will file this year that provides fiscal year 2016-specific data, as that fiscal year ended september 30, 2016. tables 1-7 of this report are prepared by my staff on the budget committee. while there are no changes to tables 4, 6, and 7 from the last report, legislative activities by authorizing committees, table 1, and the senate committee on appropriations, tables 2, 3, and 5, have made changes to budgetary levels. table 1 gives the amount by which each senate authorizing committee exceeds or is below its allocation for budget authority and outlays under the fiscal year 2016 budget resolution and the fiscal year 2017 enforceable budget levels filing. this information is used for enforcing committee allocations pursuant to section 302 of the congressional budget act of 1974, cba. enforceable levels charged to authorizing committees for fiscal year 2016 remain unchanged from the last scorekeeping report, as budget authority remains below assumed levels by $51 million and outlays are $2.7 billion above allowable levels. the remaining enforceable levels have all changed since the last report. notably, over the fiscal year 2017-2026 period, authorizing committees have approved $550 million in new budget authority and $505 million in outlays higher than allowable levels. during the last work period, congress approved two bills with significant direct spending increases, the west los angeles leasing act of 2016, h.r. 5936, p.l. 114-226, and treatment of certain payments in eugenics compensation act, s. 1698, p.l. 114-241. over 10 years, the former increased budget authority by $44 million and outlays by $18 million, and the latter increased both budget authority and outlays by $4 million. table 2 gives the amount by which the senate committee on appropriations exceeds or is below the statutory spending limits for fiscal year 2016. this information is used to determine points of order related to the spending caps found in section 312 and section 314 of the cba. on september 29, the continuing appropriations and military construction, veterans affairs, and related agencies appropriations act, 2017, was signed into law, p.l. 114-223. included in that bill as an offset for supplemental zika funding was a provision that rescinded $168 million in budget authority for fiscal year 2016 from funds provided in the patient protection and affordable care act. this rescission, which was not designated as an emergency, had the effect of reducing regular nonsecurity discretionary funding charged to the appropriations committee by $168 million. table 3 tracks the same enforcement information as table 2 for fiscal year 2017. the continuing resolution included full-year appropriations for military construction and veterans affairs programs. as such, that funding has been scored against the discretionary caps, leaving $543.1 billion and $414.8 billion in budget authority for security and nonsecurity discretionary spending, respectively, for the remainder of fiscal year 2017. table 5 tracks compliance with the fiscal year 2016 limit for overall changes in mandatory programs in appropriations bills, chimps, established in the fiscal year 2016 budget resolution. this information is used for determining points of order under section 3103 of that resolution. the $168 million rescission in the cr, discussed above, is classified as a chimp; therefore, it is scored against the overall limit of $19.1 billion. in total, the committee on appropriations will be under the chimp limit by $1.1 billion. in addition to the tables provided by the senate budget committee republican staff, i am submitting additional tables from cbo, which i will use for enforcement of budget totals agreed to by the congress. cbo provided a report both for fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2017. this information is used to enforce aggregate spending levels in budget resolutions under section 311 of the cba. cbo's estimates show that current law levels of spending for fiscal year 2016 exceed the amounts in last year's budget resolution by $138.7 billion in budget authority and $103.6 billion in outlays. revenues are $155.2 billion below the revenue floor for fiscal year 2016 set by the budget resolution. as well, social security outlays are at the levels assumed for fiscal year 2016, while social security revenues are $23 million below levels in the budget. for fiscal year 2017, cbo annualizes the temporary effects of the continuing appropriations and military construction, veterans affairs, and related agencies appropriations act, 2017, which provides funding through december 9, 2016. for the enforcement of budgetary aggregates, the senate budget committee excludes this temporary funding. as such, the committee views current law levels as being $952.4 billion and $582.9 billion below budget resolution levels for budget authority and outlays, respectively. revenues are $199 million above the level assumed in the budget resolution. finally, social security outlays and revenues are at the levels assumed in the fiscal year 2017 enforcement filing for this budget year. cbo's report also provides information needed to enforce the senate's pay-as-you-go rule. as part of the fiscal year 2017 enforcement filing, the senate's pay-as-you-go scorecard was reset to zero. since my last filing, legislative activity has resulted in an increase in the deficit of $74 million over the fiscal year 2016-2021 period, but deficit reduction of $35 million over the fiscal year 2016-2026 period. over the initial 6-year period, congress has enacted legislation that increased outlays by $482 million and revenues by $408 million. over the 11-year period, outlays were increased by $505 million and revenues by $544 million. the senate's pay-as-you-go rule is enforced by section 201 of s. con. res. 21, the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution. finally, there is one new entry in the enforcement table included at the end of this submission, which tracks the senate's budget enforcement activity on the floor. on september 14, 2016, a senate paygo budget point of order, [[page s6399]] section 201(a) of s. con res. 21, 110th congress, was raised against the water resources development act of 2016, s. amdt. 4979, for increasing the deficit by nearly $300 million over the fiscal year 2016-2026 period. this point of order was waived through a motion from senator inhofe by a vote of 85-12. while the point of order was waived, the bill has yet to clear both houses of congress, and, as such, its budgetary effects remain unrecorded for enforcement purposes. all years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years. i ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables be printed in the record. there being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the record, as follows: table 1.--senate authorizing committees--enacted direct spending above (+) or below (-) budget resolutions [in millions of dollars]

Transmittal No. 16-53 Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act Annex Item No. vii (vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 1. The Certifiable Predator B (CPB) Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) is a weapons-capable aircraft designed for medium to high altitude-long endurance Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), Target Acquisition, and Strike missions. Protector (formerly known as Scavenger) represents the CPB as modified to a UK-specific configuration which includes the design, development and integration of a UK-specific weapons installation kit for employment of UK- produced weapons (Paveway IV and Brimstone II). Building upon the legacy of Predator B's proven success, CPB/Protector provides up to 40 hours endurance, speeds up to 220 knots true air speed (KTAS) and a maximum altitude of 45,000 feet. The system is designed to be controlled by two operators within an Advanced Ground Control Station (AGCS). The AGCS is designed to emulate a reconnaissance aircraft cockpit, giving users extensive means to operate both the aircraft and sensors. CPB/Protector is able to operate using a direct Line-of-Sight (LOS) datalink or can be operated Beyond Line- of-Sight (BLOS) using satellite communications (SATCOM). The design enables unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) control to be handed off between multiple AGCSs thus allowing remote-split operations and centralized mission control with other assets. The CPB/Protector system can be deployed from a single site that supports launch, recovery, mission control, and maintenance. The system also supports remote-split operations where launch, recovery, and maintenance occur at a Forward Operating Base and mission control is conducted from another geographically separated location, or Main Operating Base (MOB). 2. The United Kingdom CPB/Protector system includes the following components. a. A secure Advanced CGCS with workstations that allow operators to control and monitor the aircraft, as well as record and exploit downlinked payload data. b. The unclassified General Atomics AN/APY-8 Block 20 Lynx Ile Synthetic Aperture Radar and Ground Moving Target Indicator (SAR/GMTI) system provides an all-weather surveillance, tracking and targeting capability. The AN/APY-8 Block 20 operates in the Ku band, using an offset-fed dish antenna mounted on a three-axis stabilized gimbal. It has a large field of regard, produces a strip map and can image up to a 10km wide swath. Swaths from multiple passes can be combined for wide-area surveillance. c. The Raytheon Multi-spectral Targeting System with Laser Target Designator (LTD) and multi-use Electro-Optical (EO)/ Infra-Red (IR) sensor provides long-range surveillance, high- altitude target acquisition, tracking, and range-finding with capabilities up to and including high definition color TV, high definition short-wave IR, medium-wave IR, and long wave IR sensors. d. The weapons installation kit enables the integration of UK-produced munitions (Paveway IV and Brimstone II) onto the Protector platform. The integration of these munitions requires specialized non-recurring engineering work which will be performed by the platform OEM in the United States. 3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain knowledge of the specific hardware or software in this proposed sale, any information gleaned from exploitation of hardware, publications and software could be used to develop countermeasures (electronic, infrared, or other types) as well as offensive and defensive counter-tactics and allow an adversary to exploit those vulnerabilities during combat. 4. A determination has been made that the recipient country can provide substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive technology being released as the US Government. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives outlined in the Policy Justification. 5. All defense articles and services listed in this transmittal have been authorized for release and export to the United Kingdom. ____ Defense Security Cooperation Agency, Arlington, VA. Hon.

Transmittal No. 16-53 Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act Annex Item No. vii (vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 1. The Certifiable Predator B (CPB) Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) is a weapons-capable aircraft designed for medium to high altitude-long endurance Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), Target Acquisition, and Strike missions. Protector (formerly known as Scavenger) represents the CPB as modified to a UK-specific configuration which includes the design, development and integration of a UK-specific weapons installation kit for employment of UK- produced weapons (Paveway IV and Brimstone II). Building upon the legacy of Predator B's proven success, CPB/Protector provides up to 40 hours endurance, speeds up to 220 knots true air speed (KTAS) and a maximum altitude of 45,000 feet. The system is designed to be controlled by two operators within an Advanced Ground Control Station (AGCS). The AGCS is designed to emulate a reconnaissance aircraft cockpit, giving users extensive means to operate both the aircraft and sensors. CPB/Protector is able to operate using a direct Line-of-Sight (LOS) datalink or can be operated Beyond Line- of-Sight (BLOS) using satellite communications (SATCOM). The design enables unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) control to be handed off between multiple AGCSs thus allowing remote-split operations and centralized mission control with other assets. The CPB/Protector system can be deployed from a single site that supports launch, recovery, mission control, and maintenance. The system also supports remote-split operations where launch, recovery, and maintenance occur at a Forward Operating Base and mission control is conducted from another geographically separated location, or Main Operating Base (MOB). 2. The United Kingdom CPB/Protector system includes the following components. a. A secure Advanced CGCS with workstations that allow operators to control and monitor the aircraft, as well as record and exploit downlinked payload data. b. The unclassified General Atomics AN/APY-8 Block 20 Lynx Ile Synthetic Aperture Radar and Ground Moving Target Indicator (SAR/GMTI) system provides an all-weather surveillance, tracking and targeting capability. The AN/APY-8 Block 20 operates in the Ku band, using an offset-fed dish antenna mounted on a three-axis stabilized gimbal. It has a large field of regard, produces a strip map and can image up to a 10km wide swath. Swaths from multiple passes can be combined for wide-area surveillance. c. The Raytheon Multi-spectral Targeting System with Laser Target Designator (LTD) and multi-use Electro-Optical (EO)/ Infra-Red (IR) sensor provides long-range surveillance, high- altitude target acquisition, tracking, and range-finding with capabilities up to and including high definition color TV, high definition short-wave IR, medium-wave IR, and long wave IR sensors. d. The weapons installation kit enables the integration of UK-produced munitions (Paveway IV and Brimstone II) onto the Protector platform. The integration of these munitions requires specialized non-recurring engineering work which will be performed by the platform OEM in the United States. 3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain knowledge of the specific hardware or software in this proposed sale, any information gleaned from exploitation of hardware, publications and software could be used to develop countermeasures (electronic, infrared, or other types) as well as offensive and defensive counter-tactics and allow an adversary to exploit those vulnerabilities during combat. 4. A determination has been made that the recipient country can provide substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive technology being released as the US Government. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives outlined in the Policy Justification. 5. All defense articles and services listed in this transmittal have been authorized for release and export to the United Kingdom. ____ Defense Security Cooperation Agency, Arlington, VA. Hon.

CREC-2016-11-16-pt1-PgS6404,CREC-2016-11-16,114,RECOGNIZING DOUG PETERSON,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6404-S6405] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING DOUG PETERSON Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Doug Peterson today as he retires as President of the Minnesota Farmers Union. I join the thousands of farmers, ranchers, small businesses, and residents of rural Minnesota in thanking Doug for his leadership over the years and for being such a tireless advocate for Minnesota farmers. Doug has made agriculture, advocacy, and public service his life's work. Prior to his election as State president of the Minnesota Farmers Union in 2002, Doug served in the Minnesota House of Representatives for 12 years, representing a district comprised of Big Stone, Chippewa, Lac Qui Parle, and Swift Counties in western Minnesota. Minnesota has taken an incredibly proactive and innovative approach to energy use and sustainability. In fact, we are considered a national leader for boosting bioenergy. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis once called States the ``laboratories of democracy,'' and when it comes to Minnesota being a laboratory for renewable fuels, we have Doug Peterson to thank. While he was in the Minnesota House of Representatives, he authored the legislation that established a Statewide ethanol fuels requirement. Because of Doug's work at the State level in steering us toward energy independence, we have seen Federal renewable energy policy being modeled after the groundwork he laid in Minnesota. In addition to writing landmark legislation and advocating on behalf of greater Minnesota, what some people may not know about Doug is that he is also an accomplished artist and former art teacher. My office in Washington even has one of Doug's paintings on loan and prominently featured. The painting is a depiction of several freshly caught fish, tessellated in shades of orange, purple, and blue. Doug called the artwork ``Dead Fish,'' and I always joke with his members that the painting is much more attractive than the name suggests. During my time in the Senate, I have had the great opportunity to work on two farm bills with Doug leading the Minnesota Farmers Union: the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 and the Agricultural Act of 2014. I have seen the dedication he brings to leading the discussion about how to keep agricultural producers competitive, and I will miss his guidance and friendship. Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, today, on behalf of all Minnesotans, I rise to thank my good friend--and a real jewel in the crown of Minnesota agriculture--Doug Peterson, as he retires as president of the Minnesota Farmers Union after 14 years of leading that important organization. To say family farming is important to Minnesota is an understatement. One in five jobs in our State is connected to agriculture, and as Doug often told me, when Minnesota farmers and ranchers succeed, prosperity follows. In all, Doug spent four decades as an influential voice on farm policy, as a family farmer, a State legislator, and, since 2002, as head of the Minnesota Farmers Union. It is fair to say that a great many national, State, and local leaders have looked to Doug not only for advice and counsel, but also to publicly lead the fight on behalf of our family farmers, ranchers, and rural communities. And I have to tell you, after going through the last farm bill debate, he is one hell of a fighter, and our State and our farmers have reaped the benefits of his work many times over. For me, as a Senator, Doug was an important mentor. He helped teach me what it takes to put crops in the ground and to get that same crop to market. He also invited me to visit farms across the State to see firsthand [[Page S6405]] the time, expense, and hard work required to raise a bushel of corn or soybeans, a ton of sugar beets, or to produce a gallon of milk. Those lessons have been important to me as I have fought for Minnesota producers in the Senate. Doug has always known how important our farmers and ranchers are to our Nation's food security and, thus, our national security. And he worked hard to ensure that people in Minnesota and across the country knew how critical our producers are to feeding a world with a growing population. As our Nation increasingly comes to grips with the causes and seriousness of climate change, it is important to point out that Doug was on the leading edge of Minnesota's clean energy transition for several decades. As a State legislator, he was instrumental in making Minnesota a national leader in ethanol production. As a champion for renewable energy, his priority was not only to reduce our reliance on foreign oil and to cut our use of fossil fuels, but also to create badly needed jobs and economic development in rural communities across Minnesota. Doug has always been a tireless fighter for family farmers, and he pushed hard against the excessive concentration of foreign and corporate power in U.S. agriculture because those forces were pushing food prices up for American consumers. He knew that our Nation's network of family farms have always delivered a safe, abundant, and affordable food supply to the American people, while receiving just 18 cents of every dollar spent on food in this country. That is a pretty good deal by any measure and one that more Americans should appreciate. So, to Doug, I say a heartfelt thank you for your years of important work, your friendship, and for teaching us all about how important Minnesota farming is to our State, to our Nation, and to the world. Your service has made a positive difference to a generation of Minnesota producers, and the work you have done will continue to serve our State well, long into the future. I wish you and your wife, Elly, your two sons, and your entire family the best of luck in the future, and I hope you continue to thrive in your well-earned retirement. Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I thank my colleague for his statement and agree. Doug Peterson has served the Minnesota Farmers Union for 14 years, the Minnesota State House of Representatives for 12 years, and the Minnesota public education system for 20 years. Whether it has been through writing and advocating legislation, painting on a canvas, or educating students, for nearly 40 years Doug Peterson has been leaving his mark. That is why I am proud to honor him today on his retirement from the Minnesota Farmers Union. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6404-S6405] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING DOUG PETERSON Ms. KLOBUCHAR.

seriousness of climate change, it is important to point out that doug was on the leading edge of minnesota's clean energy transition for several decades. as a state legislator, he was instrumental in making minnesota a national leader in ethanol production. as a champion for renewable energy, his priority was not only to reduce our reliance on foreign oil and to cut our use of fossil fuels, but also to create badly needed jobs and economic development in rural communities across minnesota. doug has always been a tireless fighter for family farmers, and he pushed hard against the excessive concentration of foreign and corporate power in u.s. agriculture because those forces were pushing food prices up for american consumers. he knew that our nation's network of family farms have always delivered a safe, abundant, and affordable food supply to the american people, while receiving just 18 cents of every dollar spent on food in this country. that is a pretty good deal by any measure and one that more americans should appreciate. so, to doug, i say a heartfelt thank you for your years of important work, your friendship, and for teaching us all about how important minnesota farming is to our state, to our nation, and to the world. your service has made a positive difference to a generation of minnesota producers, and the work you have done will continue to serve our state well, long into the future. i wish you and your wife, elly, your two sons, and your entire family the best of luck in the future, and i hope you continue to thrive in your well-earned retirement. ms. klobuchar. i thank my colleague for his statement and agree. doug peterson has served the minnesota farmers union for 14 years, the minnesota state house of representatives for 12 years, and the minnesota public education system for 20 years. whether it has been through writing and advocating legislation, painting on a canvas, or educating students, for nearly 40 years doug peterson has been leaving his mark. that is why i am proud to honor him today on his retirement from the minnesota farmers union. ____________________",6522

Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate Travis Wood, an Arkansan who is a member of the 2016 World Series Champion Chicago Cubs. Travis was born in Little Rock, AR. He comes from an athletic family and demonstrated his potential on the baseball diamond early. He gained national notice as a member of Bryant's 15-year-old All-Stars team when he pitched a no-hitter and struck out 17 batters at the Babe Ruth World Series. Travis played baseball at Bryant High School, where he was a three- time All-State selection and helped lead the Bryant Hornets to the State championship game in his junior season. He went on to win more accolades, including Saline County ``Male Athlete of the Year'' and the Arkansas Gatorade ``Player of the Year'' in addition to being named to the Louisville Slugger High School All-American team and the Louisville Slugger ``Player of the Year'' in Arkansas. After high school, Travis began his professional baseball career when he was drafted 60th overall by the Cincinnati Reds. He made his major league debut for the Reds against the Cubs at Wrigley Field on July 1, 2010. Wood was traded to the Cubs in 2011 and was named to the National League All-Star Team in 2013. This season, Travis was an integral part of the Cubs' bullpen, going 4-0 with a 2.95 ERA in 77 appearances. While he's known for his impressive pitching repertoire, Travis has also had success in the batter's box throughout his career. That was on full display in game 2 of this year's National League Division Series, when he hit a 393-foot solo homerun against the Giants and helped propel the Cubs to a 2-0 lead in the series. Travis has continued to impress throughout his professional career, and Arkansas is extremely proud of him. We are so excited for Travis and his teammates, who were able to come back from a 3-1 series deficit to win the World Series, the first time the Chicago Cubs have done so in 108 years. Travis Wood is a great ambassador for the Natural State, and I am pleased to recognize his achievements. Congratulations, Travis and the entire Chicago Cubs organization, on a historic World Series championship. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S6405] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS ______ TRIBUTE TO TRAVIS WOOD Mr. BOOZMAN.

Mr. President, today I would like to recognize the 30th anniversary of post-secondary enrollment options for high school students and the former Governor of Minnesota, Rudy Perpich, who founded this program. Mr. Perpich was the longest serving Governor of Minnesota and a proud member of the Democratic farm and labor party in our great State. Since 1986, Minnesota's high school juniors and seniors have had the opportunity to participate in courses at the college level for dual credit and at no cost to the student or their family. The program has even grown now to allow sophomores to participate. This has made the transition between high school and college so much easier and affordable for our students. I have been honored to continue this effort in the Senate as we reformed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Schools across the country can now invest in accelerated learning programs, including dual enrollment programs, like post- secondary enrollment options, as part of their efforts to provide students with a well-rounded education. In 2014, more than 9,000 Minnesota students took advantage of post- secondary enrollment option courses. With the growing cost of college, it is more important than ever that we continue to champion opportunities for students to save. Today I would like to honor Governor Rudy Perpich for investing in the education of our children and working to make higher education more accessible and affordable for all students. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S6405] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF POST-SECONDARY ENROLLMENT OPTIONS Mr. FRANKEN.

It gives me great pleasure to [[Page S6406]] congratulate her on many years of hard work for the city of Sparks and her recent election to the Nevada State Senate. As a graduate of the University of Nevada at Reno, UNR, Councilwoman Ratti is an exemplary role model who is truly devoted to the citizens of Sparks and Nevada. Before she was elected to the Sparks City Council, Councilwoman Ratti founded and served as president of Strategic Management Services, a consultant firm providing nonprofit and government services. Additionally, Councilwoman Ratti worked as an influential leader for young women as a Girl Scouts of the USA nonprofit manager and former executive. Since her first term as councilwoman in 2008, she remained committed to helping the Sparks community by serving as a strong advocate for initiatives that helped meet the needs of the city's most vulnerable. Specifically, as chair of the city's redevelopment agency, Councilwoman Ratti focused on improving infrastructure and development in areas around Victorian Square, as well as refining recreational facilities. She also served on the Washoe County District Board of Health, Truckee Meadows Water Authority, Capital Funding Protection Committee and Oversight Committee for School Facilities, and the Sparks Legislative Team. Councilwoman Ratti's impact on local businesses and her relentless advocacy for improving the Sparks community should serve as an example to all. Her steadfast support for the children of Sparks, as well as her entire constituency, will be remembered and missed. Councilwoman Ratti's leadership and achieved success throughout northern Nevada proves her dedication to community service, and she should be proud of her accomplishments throughout her tenure as a Sparks city councilwoman. I am grateful for her commitment to Sparks and to the great State of Nevada. Today I ask that all of my colleagues join me in congratulating Councilwoman Ratti on her retirement, and I offer my deepest appreciation for all that she has done for Sparks and Nevada.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Janet Snyder for tirelessly supporting Nevada's veterans and military families, particularly military spouses and widows. Mrs. Snyder is dedicated to giving back to the brave men and women who defend our freedom and has contributed greatly to the Las Vegas military community and to the greater good of the Silver State. Mrs. Snyder understands the many sacrifices military families make on a daily basis. As an army wife, mother of three, grandmother of six, and great-grandmother of five, she stands as a shining example of someone who has devoted her life to the betterment of others, selflessly serving to advocate for the interests of our Nation's heroes and their families each day. Her dedication reminds us all of the importance of thanking the men and women serving this great Nation, as well as their families, for their countless sacrifices. Since the passing of her husband of 52 years, Mrs. Snyder has provided unwavering support and care for military widows as president of several military wives clubs and support groups. In fact, Mrs. Snyder was recently installed as president of the National Society of Military Widows in October of 2016. The Silver State is grateful and honored to have a Nevadan leading this critical organization. Additionally, Mrs. Snyder is the secretary and acting treasurer of the Society of Military Widows of Southern Nevada Chapter 34 and was also the founding president from 2012 to 2015. Mrs. Snyder is also an active member of multiple religious groups. She was editor of the Military Jewish Chapel Newsletter and directed and participated in many projects with local religious leaders from Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish communities. Mrs. Snyder is also known for her outstanding advocacy for military widows by fighting against unfair benefit adjustments that negatively impact families of deceased veterans. Specifically, she has played a pivotal role in fighting for legislation, S. 979, to reverse the offset of the Survivor Benefit Plan, SBP, and Dependency and Indemnity Compensation, DIC, programs so that spouses of late military retirees fairly receive their deserved benefits without any deductions. As a cosponsor of this bill in the Senate and as a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I truly admire Mrs. Snyder's commitment to these families and believe she is an extraordinary role model to all Nevadans. Mrs. Snyder's hard work has not gone unnoticed. I extend my deepest gratitude to Mrs. Snyder for her noble contributions to the Las Vegas military community. Her service to Nevada places her among the most remarkable men and women of the State, and acknowledgement of her dedication is well deserved. I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in recognizing Mrs. Snyder and her work with veterans and their families. Her efforts are both honorable and necessary.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Dale Sandstrom, who is retiring from the North Dakota Supreme Court after 24 years of devoted service. Justice Sandstrom is a fifth-generation North Dakotan. Born in Grand Forks, he grew up in Fargo and graduated first from North Dakota State University and then from the University of North Dakota School of Law. After law school, Justice Sandstrom began his career in public service. He came to Washington, DC, to work under Senator Milton R. Young, who was North Dakota's 15th Senator and, for a time, President Pro Tempore of the U.S. Senate. Justice Sandstrom returned to North Dakota to work on the North Dakota Criminal Justice Commission. He then served for 6 years as assistant attorney general and headed the office's Consumer Fraud and Antitrust Division. In 1981, North Dakota Governor Allen I. Olson appointed Justice Sandstrom to his cabinet as the State securities commissioner. Two years later, in 1983, Justice Sandstrom was appointed to the North Dakota Public Service Commission, a position to which he was elected in 1984 and then reelected to in 1990. During his tenure on the commission, he served two terms as its president. In 1992, Justice Sandstrom was elected to the North Dakota Supreme Court. He was reelected to two 10-year terms in 1996 and 2006 and was a member of the court during my time as Governor of North Dakota. Justice Sandstrom chairs the North Dakota Supreme Court's Joint Procedure Committee and the North Dakota Advisory Commission on Cameras in the Courtroom. He is also a member of the court's Joint Committee on Attorney Standards and is a past chairman of the court's Technology Committee, the North Dakota Judicial Conference, and the North Dakota Judges Association. North Dakotans have tremendous access to justice, and the State is a leader in court technology because of Justice Sandstrom's work. In 1996, he created the court's award-winning website, and in 2011, North Dakota became the first State in the country to have its entire trial court system on an electronic record system. Justice Sandstrom is married to Gail Hagerty, who is a judge for the North Dakota South Central Judicial District. Together, they have three children and live in Bismarck. Throughout his life, Justice Sandstrom has distinguished himself through his example of integrity and hard work, especially during his tenure on the North Dakota Supreme Court. He has shown not only outstanding knowledge of law, but also wisdom in applying it. He has been a mentor to his law clerks, as well as the State bar. Outside of his work on the court, Justice Sandstrom is an active member in the Bismarck community. An Eagle Scout, he remains active in scouting and received the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award for his involvement. We honor Justice Sandstrom for his excellent work, and we celebrate his achievements. His efforts have made our State a safer and better place to live, and we commemorate him for his dedication to the people of North Dakota. The court has been well-served by his thoughtful opinions from the bench, and North Dakota will always be grateful for his service to our State. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S6407] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO DALE SANDSTROM Mr. HOEVEN.

Mr. President, to commemorate Public Recognition Week, the Vermont Federal Executive Association--VTFEA--recognized the more than 4,000 Federal employees working across the State and the good work they do every day. I would like to offer special congratulations to the 2016 Excellence in Government award winners, who have been recognized by VTFEA for their exemplary government service: Vermont Federal Team of the Year Award, The Northwest Vermont Locality Pay Committee--Brandon Ackel, Transportation Security Administration; Robert Brugman, National Credit Union Administration; Brian Johansson, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services; Kelly Larsen, Federal Aviation Administration, Alaska; Bruce McDonald, Transportation Security Administration; Sean McVey, U.S. Customs and Border Protection; Mark Nielsen, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement; Jeff Ostlund, Transportation Security Administration; Corey Price, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Texas; Lisa Rees, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services; Diana Richardson, Federal Aviation Administration; Krista Scheele, Transportation Security Administration. In November 2012, VTFEA discussed what initiatives would benefit the most Federal employees, and it didn't take long to realize that securing locality pay for Vermont was the No. 1 priority. In early 2013, VTFEA created a Locality Pay Committee, consisting of employees from six Federal agencies. Working tirelessly, the team prepared a locality pay proposal for northwest Vermont and, in December 2013, presented it to the Federal Salary Council in Washington, DC. Unfortunately, the first proposal was denied, so the following year, they tried again. Again, the proposal was denied. Not to be discouraged, the team drafted a third proposal in November 2015, and committee members traveled to Washington at their own expense to support the package and their fellow Vermonters. At the hearing, the council approved the package, which is waiting for approval by the President's pay agent and the President. The Northwest Vermont Locality Pay Committee's tenacity, collaborative spirit, and positivity is why Vermont is being considered for locality pay. And it is because of their efforts that VTFEA chose them as Federal Team of the Year. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S6407] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] VERMONT FEDERAL EXECUTIVE ASSOCIATION 2016 AWARDS Mr. SANDERS.

GREGORY FRITZ,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S6408] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO DR. GREGORY FRITZ Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, today Dr. Gregory Fritz will be honored by the Mental Health Association of Rhode Island with the Bell Award. This award recognizes a mental health champion whose work has helped promote the cause of mental health and improved of lives of people living with mental illness. For over three decades, Dr. Fritz's leadership and advocacy have strengthened our Rhode Island community. He arrived in Rhode Island in 1985 to build a comprehensive pediatric psychiatry service at Hasbro Children's Hospital. Since, Dr. Fritz has become the academic director of Bradley Hospital, the director of Bradley Hasbro Children's Research Center, the director of the Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at Rhode Island Hospital, and the director of the Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior at the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University. Dr. Fritz is also a national leader in the mental health field, serving as the president of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry. He has used this platform to encourage integration of mental health services into primary care, a key strategy to improving children's access to mental health care, and ultimately, their health outcomes. It has been my privilege to see up close Dr. Fritz's dedication and drive to improve the lives of children and adults with mental illness. A decades-long effort I led with Senator Jack Reed to provide parity in Federal funding for teaching programs at children's psychiatric hospitals would not have been possible without Dr. Fritz. We hit many road bumps along the way, but Dr. Fritz did not stray from the course. He left no stone unturned--and no strategic partner uncalled--in advocating for this change. He noted, quite honestly, in an op-ed published in the Providence Journal, ``I am far from dispassionate about this issue.'' Dr. Fritz has displayed passion and energy for raising awareness and bringing people together to identify solutions to a range of issues, including mental health parity, addiction and recovery, and workforce training. This is so important for the communities he serves--children and young adults with mental health and substance use disorders--who too often don't have a strong advocate. Thankfully, in Rhode Island, they have Dr. Fritz. Dr. Gregory Fritz has dedicated his career to improving the lives of children with mental illness, and many have benefited from his leadership. I offer him my congratulations on this well-deserved award, and I look forward to continuing to work alongside him. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S6408] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO DR.

CREC-2016-11-16-pt1-PgS6422,CREC-2016-11-16,114,ACCOUNTABILITY AT THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6422-S6423] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ACCOUNTABILITY AT THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I have the honor of serving with the chair on the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, and I want to speak tonight about a set of issues, a circumstance that we have found ourselves in. As you will recall, several years ago there was a national news story and our Nation was appalled to learn that Department of Veterans Affairs employees from across the country were creating secret waiting lists that stood between veterans and the care they deserved. Veterans died waiting for care because of deceptive practices at the VA. In the wake of that wrongdoing, I called for the resignation of the then- Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. At that time, I didn't think things could get worse at the Department, but I was wrong. In 2014, during the confirmation hearings for the current VA Secretary, Bob McDonald, he seemed to understand the urgency demanded by the American people and by their Congress to fix the problems at the Department of Veterans Affairs. In his testimony, he promised that ``the seriousness of this moment demands action . . . those employees that have violated the trust of the Nation and of veterans must be, and will be, held accountable.'' Now, more than 2 years later, with authorities granted by Congress and signed into law by the President, the Secretary seems to have forgotten that promise. Time and time again, the Secretary uses a talking point on accountability, stating ``the VA has terminated more than 4,095 employees'' since he arrived. The real number of terminations is three. Only three people have been discharged from the VA for their misconduct, and another 12 to 15 are ``potential removals or demotions.'' What the Secretary hasn't said is that thousands of those terminations were actually employees placed on paid leave, thereby racking up $23 million to pay the salaries of 2,500 VA employees who weren't actually working. The opportunity for the Secretary and for the VA to hold bad actors accountable has been squandered. The terrible part of this is that Americans have been misled. The accountability the VA created in the wake of the scandal about the fake waiting lists has generated further disappointment and scandal due to the mismanagement and manipulation. Instead of firing people, Americans are paying bad actors to do nothing or, worse yet, they have been transferred to other facilities to continue bad practices. The morale of the vast majority--a huge number--of hard-working people who work for the VA, many who are veterans themselves, has to be harmed as they care for veterans every day and suffer in this culture of corruption. In Kansas, my home State, we face one of the worst examples of a VA employee violating the trust of a veteran. Yet the VA seems to have no sense of urgency in holding this person accountable or committing to fixing the process that enabled this individual to do what he did. In 2015, we learned from newspaper reports--certainly not from the VA--that a physician assistant at the Leavenworth VA hospital, Mr. Mark Wisner, had been sexually abusing veteran patients. Shortly after that news broke, the Leavenworth county prosecutors charged this individual with multiple counts of sexual assault and abuse against numerous veterans. We learned, as the story unfolded, that he had targeted vulnerable veterans suffering from PTSD. He prescribed opioids that inhibited their thinking, and he used his position to deepen the wounds of war rather than healing them. I will share a quote from two Army veteran brothers who were patients and felt they had no choice but to continue seeking the care or lose the health care benefits they had earned. One of them said: ``The fear of losing what I had earned [in benefits] versus the fear of being sexually assaulted again, I don't know which one was more important.'' Imagine the desperation of a veteran trying to answer that question. Again, what is so troubling about this situation is that Mr. Wisner should never have been hired by the VA in the first place. As we add injury to insult for these veteran victims, he was not fired after he admitted the abuse. He was allowed to retire, and his voluntary retirement means he receives certain benefits that he might not otherwise received if he had actually been fired. According to publicly available documents, Mr. Wisner indicated on his application for licensure that he had been convicted of a crime, and further information indicates the crime and convictions were lewd in nature. Yet he was hired. It is infuriating--it is worse than infuriating--that a person with a criminal record, convicted of a lewd crime, was still hired to be at the frontlines of veteran patient care. When the VA was asked about his criminal record, they indicated that background checks are contingent upon ``the position's risk level'' and that physician assistant positions were considered ``low risk'' and didn't require an exhaustive background check. In my view, a practitioner in patient care should be held to the highest standards of excellence and should receive an exhaustive background check. How can a position in patient care be considered low risk at the VA? Fortunately, as I said, I serve with the Presiding Officer on the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, and I had the opportunity during one of our committee hearings last September--just a few months ago--to question Secretary McDonald about the background check process and why Mr. Wisner was hired with a known criminal background. The Secretary's response was ``there was nothing in his file that suggested that there was a risk.'' He also suggested that I had different information than he did--than he, the Secretary, did--which is hard to believe because the documentation I was reading from, the circumstances I was describing, came directly from his own Office of Inspector General. I have also sent the Secretary a letter with more than 20 questions about this situation, hoping I could receive substantive answers to those questions. More than 2 months passed until I received a response last week from the Under Secretary for Health. Actually, I was hoping to learn something from that response about the VA's commitment to fixing their hiring practices, not a canned answer regarding the VA's current process for background checks. Certainly, the 20 questions asked of the Secretary remain unanswered. They remain unanswered regarding why the VA's credentialing process failed to catch Mr. Wisner--a convict. Does the VA not consider lewd crimes or convictions in an applicant's file as a risk to veterans? The responses have been unacceptable. The lack of response has been unacceptable. Also unacceptable are the circumstances surrounding Mr. Wisner's separation from the VA. Instead of an immediate termination, unbelievably, he was permitted to retire with full benefits. When the VA police received a complaint about Mr. Wisner in May of 2014, they alerted the VA inspector general. Wisner was removed from patient care and placed on paid administrative leave while the IG conducted its investigation. Some days later, in an interview with the VA inspector general's special agent, Wisner admitted he ``crossed the professional line'' and that he engaged in ``unnecessary and inappropriate behavior of a sexual nature.'' Mr. Wisner made no attempt to hide his actions, stating that he ``knew what he was doing to these patients was wrong and that he had no self-control.'' Despite confessing to these horrible and illegal actions, Mr. Wisner continued to be an employee of the VA for 37 more days, giving him enough time to beat the VA to the punch and seeking and receiving retirement on June 28, 2014. One would think the moment a VA employee admits to violating or abusing a patient, a client, or a coworker would be the moment their paycheck would end and they would no longer be employed; that there would be zero tolerance for such egregious conduct. Grounds for immediate termination clearly existed from Wisner's own confessions. Yet he was able to gather all his personal documents and submit his [[Page S6423]] retirement paperwork to the VA to guarantee his retirement benefits-- benefits, incidentally, that millions of veterans continue to wait for years and decades to receive. There are so many factors about this situation that are troublesome, upsetting, and disgusting, but most importantly our veterans themselves are distraught. The VA failed to protect them from a sexual predator. They were taken advantage of and they are hurting. One victim took his own life, troubled by what happened to him. Wisner's termination void of retirement benefits maybe would have brought a small measure of justice to the victims. Despite having more than enough justification and the authority to fire Wisner, the VA chose to do nothing, and that inaction sends a very strong and disappointing message not only to our veterans but to the VA employees who are looking to the VA to have their best interest and the best interest of patients they care for, our veterans, at heart. Our veterans are expecting the VA to live up to the ``I CARE'' values created by the Secretary. Secretary McDonald announced the I CARE Program, and I can tell you that veterans in Kansas would agree that the VA did not demonstrate integrity, commitment, advocacy, respect or excellence in these circumstances. When given the opportunity in a hearing and in writing, the VA's top executives are unable to put at rest not just my mind but the minds of veterans back home in Kansas. Veterans deserve a heartfelt, thorough examination, a thorough explanation of what went wrong and what is now being done to make certain that it never happens again. Our local VA folks in our State have done what they can do to reach out to veteran patients. The stories continue to grow. Veterans continue to come forward. However, this is a serious and significant incident. The serious and significant incidents require more than just outreach. They require more than just what can happen in Kansas. They require an engagement by the top leadership officials at the Department of Veterans Affairs. The VA's refusal to admit fault or commit to remedying this situation gives little confidence to Congress and, more importantly, to veterans who are being asked to trust the Department that failed to protect them. It appears the Secretary has forgotten his promise made over 2 years ago to uphold the ``seriousness of the moment,'' to hold those responsible for bad behavior accountable. There could be no more serious moment. There could be no more serious moment of recklessness by the VA than the abuse of a veteran by its own employees. I yield the floor. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6422-S6423] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ACCOUNTABILITY AT THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS Mr. MORAN.

I yield the floor. ____________________",package_114_207.csv,11001,11001,11075,"[congressional record volume 162, number 164 (wednesday, november 16, 2016)] [senate] [pages s6422-s6423] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] accountability at the department of veterans affairs mr. moran. mr. president, i have the honor of serving with the chair on the senate committee on veterans' affairs, and i want to speak tonight about a set of issues, a circumstance that we have found ourselves in. as you will recall, several years ago there was a national news story and our nation was appalled to learn that department of veterans affairs employees from across the country were creating secret waiting lists that stood between veterans and the care they deserved. veterans died waiting for care because of deceptive practices at the va. in the wake of that wrongdoing, i called for the resignation of the then- secretary of the department of veterans affairs. at that time, i didn't think things could get worse at the department, but i was wrong. in 2014, during the confirmation hearings for the current va secretary, bob mcdonald, he seemed to understand the urgency demanded by the american people and by their congress to fix the problems at the department of veterans affairs. in his testimony, he promised that ``the seriousness of this moment demands action . . . those employees that have violated the trust of the nation and of veterans must be, and will be, held accountable.'' now, more than 2 years later, with authorities granted by congress and signed into law by the president, the secretary seems to have forgotten that promise. time and time again, the secretary uses a talking point on accountability, stating ``the va has terminated more than 4,095 employees'' since he arrived. the real number of terminations is three. only three people have been discharged from the va for their misconduct, and another 12 to 15 are ``potential removals or demotions.'' what the secretary hasn't said is that thousands of those terminations were actually employees placed on paid leave, thereby racking up $23 million to pay the salaries of 2,500 va employees who weren't actually working. the opportunity for the secretary and for the va to hold bad actors accountable has been squandered. the terrible part of this is that americans have been misled. the accountability the va created in the wake of the scandal about the fake waiting lists has generated further disappointment and scandal due to the mismanagement and manipulation. instead of firing people, americans are paying bad actors to do nothing or, worse yet, they have been transferred to other facilities to continue bad practices. the morale of the vast majority--a huge number--of hard-working people who work for the va, many who are veterans themselves, has to be harmed as they care for veterans every day and suffer in this culture of corruption. in kansas, my home state, we face one of the worst examples of a va employee violating the trust of a veteran. yet the va seems to have no sense of urgency in holding this person accountable or committing to fixing the process that enabled this individual to do what he did. in 2015, we learned from newspaper reports--certainly not from the va--that a physician assistant at the leavenworth va hospital, mr. mark wisner, had been sexually abusing veteran patients. shortly after that news broke, the leavenworth county prosecutors charged this individual with multiple counts of sexual assault and abuse against numerous veterans. we learned, as the story unfolded, that he had targeted vulnerable veterans suffering from ptsd. he prescribed opioids that inhibited their thinking, and he used his position to deepen the wounds of war rather than healing them. i will share a quote from two army veteran brothers who were patients and felt they had no choice but to continue seeking the care or lose the health care benefits they had earned. one of them said: ``the fear of losing what i had earned [in benefits] versus the fear of being sexually assaulted again, i don't know which one was more important.'' imagine the desperation of a veteran trying to answer that question. again, what is so troubling about this situation is that mr. wisner should never have been hired by the va in the first place. as we add injury to insult for these veteran victims, he was not fired after he admitted the abuse. he was allowed to retire, and his voluntary retirement means he receives certain benefits that he might not otherwise received if he had actually been fired. according to publicly available documents, mr. wisner indicated on his application for licensure that he had been convicted of a crime, and further information indicates the crime and convictions were lewd in nature. yet he was hired. it is infuriating--it is worse than infuriating--that a person with a criminal record, convicted of a lewd crime, was still hired to be at the frontlines of veteran patient care. when the va was asked about his criminal record, they indicated that background checks are contingent upon ``the position's risk level'' and that physician assistant positions were considered ``low risk'' and didn't require an exhaustive background check. in my view, a practitioner in patient care should be held to the highest standards of excellence and should receive an exhaustive background check. how can a position in patient care be considered low risk at the va? fortunately, as i said, i serve with the presiding officer on the committee on veterans' affairs, and i had the opportunity during one of our committee hearings last september--just a few months ago--to question secretary mcdonald about the background check process and why mr. wisner was hired with a known criminal background. the secretary's response was ``there was nothing in his file that suggested that there was a risk.'' he also suggested that i had different information than he did--than he, the secretary, did--which is hard to believe because the documentation i was reading from, the circumstances i was describing, came directly from his own office of inspector general. i have also sent the secretary a letter with more than 20 questions about this situation, hoping i could receive substantive answers to those questions. more than 2 months passed until i received a response last week from the under secretary for health. actually, i was hoping to learn something from that response about the va's commitment to fixing their hiring practices, not a canned answer regarding the va's current process for background checks. certainly, the 20 questions asked of the secretary remain unanswered. they remain unanswered regarding why the va's credentialing process failed to catch mr. wisner--a convict. does the va not consider lewd crimes or convictions in an applicant's file as a risk to veterans? the responses have been unacceptable. the lack of response has been unacceptable. also unacceptable are the circumstances surrounding mr. wisner's separation from the va. instead of an immediate termination, unbelievably, he was permitted to retire with full benefits. when the va police received a complaint about mr. wisner in may of 2014, they alerted the va inspector general. wisner was removed from patient care and placed on paid administrative leave while the ig conducted its investigation. some days later, in an interview with the va inspector general's special agent, wisner admitted he ``crossed the professional line'' and that he engaged in ``unnecessary and inappropriate behavior of a sexual nature.'' mr. wisner made no attempt to hide his actions, stating that he ``knew what he was doing to these patients was wrong and that he had no self-control.'' despite confessing to these horrible and illegal actions, mr. wisner continued to be an employee of the va for 37 more days, giving him enough time to beat the va to the punch and seeking and receiving retirement on june 28, 2014. one would think the moment a va employee admits to violating or abusing a patient, a client, or a coworker would be the moment their paycheck would end and they would no longer be employed; that there would be zero tolerance for such egregious conduct. grounds for immediate termination clearly existed from wisner's own confessions. yet he was able to gather all his personal documents and submit his [[page s6423]] retirement paperwork to the va to guarantee his retirement benefits-- benefits, incidentally, that millions of veterans continue to wait for years and decades to receive. there are so many factors about this situation that are troublesome, upsetting, and disgusting, but most importantly our veterans themselves are distraught. the va failed to protect them from a sexual predator. they were taken advantage of and they are hurting. one victim took his own life, troubled by what happened to him. wisner's termination void of retirement benefits maybe would have brought a small measure of justice to the victims. despite having more than enough justification and the authority to fire wisner, the va chose to do nothing, and that inaction sends a very strong and disappointing message not only to our veterans but to the va employees who are looking to the va to have their best interest and the best interest of patients they care for, our veterans, at heart. our veterans are expecting the va to live up to the ``i care'' values created by the secretary. secretary mcdonald announced the i care program, and i can tell you that veterans in kansas would agree that the va did not demonstrate integrity, commitment, advocacy, respect or excellence in these circumstances. when given the opportunity in a hearing and in writing, the va's top executives are unable to put at rest not just my mind but the minds of veterans back home in kansas. veterans deserve a heartfelt, thorough examination, a thorough explanation of what went wrong and what is now being done to make certain that it never happens again. our local va folks in our state have done what they can do to reach out to veteran patients. the stories continue to grow. veterans continue to come forward. however, this is a serious and significant incident. the serious and significant incidents require more than just outreach. they require more than just what can happen in kansas. they require an engagement by the top leadership officials at the department of veterans affairs. the va's refusal to admit fault or commit to remedying this situation gives little confidence to congress and, more importantly, to veterans who are being asked to trust the department that failed to protect them. it appears the secretary has forgotten his promise made over 2 years ago to uphold the ``seriousness of the moment,'' to hold those responsible for bad behavior accountable. there could be no more serious moment. there could be no more serious moment of recklessness by the va than the abuse of a veteran by its own employees. i yield the floor. ____________________",11001

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5732, the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act of 2016. In September, a trending comment on Twitter read: This is not Pompeii, this is Aleppo. Think about that for a minute. The death and destruction in Aleppo has reached such epic proportions that we are comparing it to one of the most deadly natural disasters in world history. The President and his administration have continued to highlight the horrors of Syria exhibited by Assad and Putin by using terms like ``barbarism'', ``beyond the pale'', and ``haunting''. I think the more apt term for this is ``a problem from hell.'' Yet, even as the President, Secretary of State, and Ambassador to the UN continue to talk about the carnage in Syria, there has been very little action to end the suffering of the people of Aleppo and across Syria. Mr. Speaker, it pains me every single time I come to the well of the House to talk about the atrocities in Syria. But we are failing the innocent people of Syria through our inaction. Rather than enforcing red lines for Assad's use of chemical weapons or enhancing sanctions against the Russians for their war crimes in the bombing of medical facilities and aid convoys, the President and Secretary of State focus their attention on sham ceasefires that are continually violated by the people with which we negotiate. They constantly worry about the Iranians walking away from flawed nuclear deals instead of leading the global community to end the atrocities in Syria. I have said it before, and I will say it again: Russia and Iran are not our allies. Their interests lie in destabilizing Europe and turning the Middle East into a wasteland of murder and chaos. Mr. Speaker, there needs to be a true cost for the complicity in war crimes and crimes against humanity. It's time that Russia, Iran, and Syria are held accountable. That is why this bill is so important. It would increase sanctions on the Assad regime and its supporters for the continued atrocities committed against the Syrian people. It requires this administration and any future administration to stand up and impose costs on the Russians, Syrians, and Iranians for the barrel bombing and gassing of innocent civilians. I want to thank my colleagues, Congressman Engel and Congressman Royce for introducing this critical bill. We owe it to the innocent people of Syria to bring justice against the Assad regime, Russian military, and their allies and help the struggling people of Syria. If we fail to act, fail to lead--this Syrian Civil War will be the greatest humanitarian crisis of the 21st century. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1489] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CAESAR SYRIA CIVILIAN PROTECTION ACT OF 2016 ______ speech of HON.

That is why this bill is so important. It would increase sanctions on the Assad regime and its supporters for the continued atrocities committed against the Syrian people. It requires this administration and any future administration to stand up and impose costs on the Russians, Syrians, and Iranians for the barrel bombing and gassing of innocent civilians. I want to thank my colleagues, Congressman Engel and Congressman Royce for introducing this critical bill. We owe it to the innocent people of Syria to bring justice against the Assad regime, Russian military, and their allies and help the struggling people of Syria. If we fail to act, fail to lead--this Syrian Civil War will be the greatest humanitarian crisis of the 21st century. ____________________",package_114_207.csv,3027,3027,3101,"[congressional record volume 162, number 164 (wednesday, november 16, 2016)] [extensions of remarks] [page e1489] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] caesar syria civilian protection act of 2016 ______ speech of hon. adam kinzinger of illinois in the house of representatives tuesday, november 15, 2016 mr. kinzinger of illinois. mr. speaker, i rise in strong support of h.r. 5732, the caesar syria civilian protection act of 2016. in september, a trending comment on twitter read: this is not pompeii, this is aleppo. think about that for a minute. the death and destruction in aleppo has reached such epic proportions that we are comparing it to one of the most deadly natural disasters in world history. the president and his administration have continued to highlight the horrors of syria exhibited by assad and putin by using terms like ``barbarism'', ``beyond the pale'', and ``haunting''. i think the more apt term for this is ``a problem from hell.'' yet, even as the president, secretary of state, and ambassador to the un continue to talk about the carnage in syria, there has been very little action to end the suffering of the people of aleppo and across syria. mr. speaker, it pains me every single time i come to the well of the house to talk about the atrocities in syria. but we are failing the innocent people of syria through our inaction. rather than enforcing red lines for assad's use of chemical weapons or enhancing sanctions against the russians for their war crimes in the bombing of medical facilities and aid convoys, the president and secretary of state focus their attention on sham ceasefires that are continually violated by the people with which we negotiate. they constantly worry about the iranians walking away from flawed nuclear deals instead of leading the global community to end the atrocities in syria. i have said it before, and i will say it again: russia and iran are not our allies. their interests lie in destabilizing europe and turning the middle east into a wasteland of murder and chaos. mr. speaker, there needs to be a true cost for the complicity in war crimes and crimes against humanity. it's time that russia, iran, and syria are held accountable. that is why this bill is so important. it would increase sanctions on the assad regime and its supporters for the continued atrocities committed against the syrian people. it requires this administration and any future administration to stand up and impose costs on the russians, syrians, and iranians for the barrel bombing and gassing of innocent civilians. i want to thank my colleagues, congressman engel and congressman royce for introducing this critical bill. we owe it to the innocent people of syria to bring justice against the assad regime, russian military, and their allies and help the struggling people of syria. if we fail to act, fail to lead--this syrian civil war will be the greatest humanitarian crisis of the 21st century. ____________________",3027

PETER J. VISCLOSKY of indiana in the house of representatives Wednesday, November 16, 2016 Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure and admiration that I recognize the Northwestern Indiana Regional Planning Commission (NIRPC) as the organization celebrates its 50th anniversary. Since its inception in 1966 as the Lake-Porter County Regional Transportation and Planning Commission, which became NIRPC in 1973, the agency continues to play a vital role in the planning and coordination of Northwest Indiana's highway, local road, public transit, and trails systems. In addition, NIRPC continues to perform essential regional environmental planning and land use analysis. Serving the people of Lake, LaPorte and Porter Counties, NIRPC's coordinating role among the various public interests has been crucial to the success of the region. During the course of the past 50 years, NIRPC has been instrumental in shaping our region's view toward transportation infrastructure as well as land-use planning. Often, we narrowly view transportation infrastructure as simply the roads upon which we drive. The organization's executive directors, Board of Commissioners, and transportation planners have challenged this understanding by developing programs focused upon regional transit, through its support for increasing commuter transportation opportunities along existing bus systems and the South Shore Rail Line, upon our waterways, by shaping transportation policies along our rivers, and upon our multi-modal trail system, the availability of which increased from 13 miles in 1990 to nearly 150 miles currently under NIRPC's direction. NIRPC's work to expand the concepts of interconnectivity within the communities in its three-county system benefits the economic development of our region as does its work in support of the Marquette Plan, a land-use reinvestment strategy focused upon the Lake Michigan shoreline. Working in coordination with the Northwest Indiana Regional Development Authority and the lakefront communities, NIRPC's technical expertise has led to the implementation of transformational, intergenerational projects along the lakeshore. Indiana's First Congressional District has resources other areas in our country envy--our transportation infrastructure, our waterways and shoreline, and our proximity to Chicago--all of which have been enhanced by the exceptional leadership exhibited by the dedicated individuals and municipal officials which make up NIRPC. I would be remiss if I did not mention just a few of the people who have made NIRPC's first 50 years such a great success and guarantee at least another half century of accomplishment. The commission's first Chairman, Dr. Joseph J. Forszt; Vice-Chairman, Virgil O. King; Secretary William L. Staehle; Executive Director, Norman E. Tufford; and Deputy Director Jim Ranfranz were essential in establishing and guiding the organization. NIRPC is currently under the able direction of Chairman, Chesterton Town Councilman James Ton; Vice-Chairman, Highland Clerk-Treasurer Michael Griffin; Secretary, Beverly Shores Town Councilman Geof Benson; Executive Director, Ty Warner; and Deputy Director, Steve [[Page E1490]] Strains. The wide array of talent and ideas possessed by these individuals and countless others has developed NIRPC's focus and promises its future success. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring and congratulating NIRPC. For the past 50 years, the organization has touched the lives of countless individuals through its unwavering commitment to the community of Northwest Indiana. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1489-E1490] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE NORTHWESTERN INDIANA REGIONAL PLANNING COMMISSION ______ HON.

CREC-2016-11-16-pt1-PgE1490,CREC-2016-11-16,114,TRIBUTE TO DOCTOR TOM LARWOOD AND HIS LEADERSHIP ON VALLEY FEVER RESEARCH,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1490] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO DOCTOR TOM LARWOOD AND HIS LEADERSHIP ON VALLEY FEVER RESEARCH ______ HON. KEVIN McCARTHY of california in the house of representatives Wednesday, November 16, 2016 Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and achievements of Dr. Tom Larwood, who passed away on September 6, 2016 at the age of 90. He was a devoted community leader in Kern County, California, a pioneer in Valley Fever research, and a good friend of mine. Doctor Tom--as he was known in Bakersfield--served in the Navy Hospital Corps and went on to graduate from the University of Southern California's School of Medicine. Active in his local Methodist church, Tom went on a missionary trip to South Korea in 1955 where he provided medical assistance and was instrumental in the construction of a new hospital in Wonju. Currently, Wonju Severance Christian Hospital is the largest university hospital in central Korea, a lasting marker of Tom's desire to help others. Despite contracting polio during his time in South Korea, Tom continued to lead a life of profound professional accomplishment and remained fiercely dedicated to community service. Tom settled in Bakersfield in the 1950s. During this time, he practiced medicine at Kern County General Hospital, now the Kern Medical Center, where he rose to the position of Chief of Internal Medicine. Over the course of his career, he became a respected leader and expert, both locally and nationally, on Valley Fever. He worked closely with others, including Dr. Royce Johnson and the late Dr. Hans Einstein, to raise awareness of this disease, educate health care professionals on how to diagnose and treat it, pioneer treatments and other therapies to combat Valley Fever, and promote the development of a Valley Fever vaccine--an endeavor that continues today. Valley Fever--formally known as coccidioidomycosis--is a disease caused by a fungus that is found in soil mainly in the American southwest and is contracted by inhaling spores into the lungs. This disease has long been a threat to our community and is particularly dangerous to individuals with compromised immune systems and the elderly. Tom and his wife, Pauline, whom he married in 1972, worked tirelessly with the Valley Fever Americas Foundation for more than two decades to spread awareness of Valley Fever and raise money to fund critical research designed to stamp out this disease. In fact, I was honored to recently present the Larwoods with the Hans Einstein Lifetime Achievement Award for their work on Valley Fever. After retiring from medical practice in 1991, Tom remained an active participant in an array of local medical boards and was an enthusiastic volunteer with the American Lung Association, Boy Scouts of America (he was an Eagle Scout), Bethany Homeless Center, and the Bakersfield Symphony Orchestra, among others. I considered the advice Doctor Tom gave me--whether on Valley Fever, health care issues, or how to better serve our community--as invaluable. He is survived by Pauline, his children, David, Don, Dean, Debbie, Diana, Mike, and Scott, and his eight grandchildren. I will miss Tom's great sense of humor and constant optimism, and I know he will be fondly remembered in the hearts and minds of the countless patients and their families that he served in Kern County. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1490] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO DOCTOR TOM LARWOOD AND HIS LEADERSHIP ON VALLEY FEVER RESEARCH ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the residents, businesses, and Board of Supervisors of Schuylkill Township as they celebrate 190 years as a municipality in Chester County, Pennsylvania. Swedish and Dutch settlers first arrived in the area situated between the Schuylkill River and Pickering Creek in 1713 and named the river ``Schuylkill'', meaning ``hidden river'' in Dutch. More than a century later on November 4, 1826, the eastern portion of neighboring Charlestown Township was declared Schuylkill Township by the Chester County Court. One of the Township's most-recognized historical structures is the Schuylkill Friends Meeting House where several generations of Quakers have worshipped and, prior to the Civil War, aided slaves seeking freedom and hosted visits by noted abolitionists of the era. The Township's rich agriculture heritage includes sprawling farms owned by the Reeves family, who operated the Phoenix Iron Works, and relatives of former Pennsylvania Governor Samuel Whitaker Pennypacker. Today, more than 8,500 people call the 9.44 square miles that make up Schuylkill Township home. The community commemorated the Township's 190th anniversary on Saturday, November 5, 2016, during its annual Founders Day celebration.

Now, Mr. Sikes's son holds the position--truly speaking to the amount of respect that the community has for Mr. Robert Sikes and his family.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate an outstanding school that is being honored as a 2016 National Blue Ribbon School. It is a pleasure to congratulate Cathedral High School in Indianapolis, Indiana in celebration of this special occasion. [[Page E1491]] The National Blue Ribbon designation, given by the United States Department of Education, is awarded to both public and private schools across our great nation. Started by President Reagan and given annually since 1982, the award celebrates great American schools that achieve very high learning standards or are making significant improvements in the academic achievements of their students. In my district and across the country, the award recognizes the great educators, students, and parents who have worked so hard to ensure Indiana's children reach their full potential and achieve academic success. For all of these reasons and many more, I am so proud that Cathedral High School is receiving this prestigious designation. It is a wonderful acknowledgement of the school's commitment to providing young Hoosiers an exceptional education. While hundreds of schools nationwide were nominated, only 329 schools were designated as 2016 National Blue Ribbon Schools and Cathedral High School was 1 of 50 private schools to receive recognition, making this recognition all the more impressive. Cathedral was the only high school in Indiana to achieve the National Blue Ribbon award in 2016. Cathedral provides its students with an outstanding education both academically and within the Catholic faith. An exceptional Catholic high school in the Holy Cross tradition, Cathedral transforms a diverse group of students spiritually, intellectually, socially, emotionally, and physically. Their mission to educate students with the competence to see and the courage to act prepares students to be principled learners and future leaders. I applaud Cathedral High School for its work to ensure its students engage in significant acts of community service and remain dedicated to carrying out the mission of Jesus Christ. As an advocate for education and youth, I also want to acknowledge how important it is to our nation's future to encourage and raise a new generation of Americans who have the skills and knowledge to succeed both in and out of the classroom. Students like those at Cathedral High School give me hope that we will accomplish this vital mission. Their outstanding work is an inspiration to students, educators, and parents across the nation. Once again, congratulations to Cathedral High School.

A Saturday church school program geared toward local youth offers meals, field trip opportunities, and a chance to find an outlet for their musical talents by participating in a bell choir, which has performed countless times at other churches in the area. And a community leadership lecture series named in honor of the late Pottstown NAACP leader, Newstell Marable, aims to educate and empower by addressing an array of issues related to finding employment, building a secure financial future, and strengthening the community. Mr. Speaker, I would ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Pottstown on this memorable milestone and in extending our sincere appreciation for the outstanding spirit of volunteerism and compassion demonstrated time and time again during the past 145 years by Church leaders and congregants. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1491] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMMEMORATING THE 145TH ANNIVERSARY OF BETHEL AFRICAN METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH IN POTTSTOWN ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the oldest African-American Church in Pottstown as its congregation celebrates 145 years of worship, fellowship and stewardship in the community. Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church first opened its doors in April 1871 at North Franklin and Beech Streets. In addition to tending to the spiritual needs of its members, Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church has always taken great pride in serving anyone in need throughout the greater Pottstown community. Specifically, the Church operated a thriving food pantry for many years that fed hundreds of families. A Saturday church school program geared toward local youth offers meals, field trip opportunities, and a chance to find an outlet for their musical talents by participating in a bell choir, which has performed countless times at other churches in the area. And a community leadership lecture series named in honor of the late Pottstown NAACP leader, Newstell Marable, aims to educate and empower by addressing an array of issues related to finding employment, building a secure financial future, and strengthening the community.

I have had the great pleasure to have known and worked with George S. Lockwood for over 40 years. He is a boundless innovator, an expansive dreamer, and a relentless task master. I have no doubt that he is one of those remarkable human beings whose life's work in aquaculture will continue to pay dividends for humanity long into the future. George originally trained as an engineer. He earned a BS in Civil Engineering from Northwestern University followed by an MBA from Harvard University. He began his career with Perini, Inc., a large global heavy construction company where he served in various engineering and executive management positions. [[Page E1492]] He next joined Los Angeles based Global Marine where he managed special projects for the firm's offshore drilling, marine engineering, and construction. George then left the corporate world to begin his second career as an aquaculture innovator. He founded Monterey Kelp Corporation in California, a marine plant harvesting and processing company that he later sold to a subsidiary of the pharmaceutical giant Merck. In 1972, he established Monterey Abalone Farms to develop commercial technologies for growing abalone and other seafood. Then in 1984, Mr. Lockwood founded Ocean Farms of Hawaii (OFH) in Kona, Hawaii, to grow salmon, oysters, abalone, sea urchins and marine plants on a commercial scale using cold pure seawater pumped from the deep ocean into ponds and tanks onshore. He recently founded a new company, Ocean Farms of The Bahamas, which he hopes will lead an expansion of aquaculture in the Caribbean. All along, George used his aquaculture experience to help shape public policy. In 1980, he worked with Congress to help craft the National Aquaculture Act. He then helped me in the California Legislature with drafting the California Aquaculture Act of 1982. This legislation modernized the regulation of aquaculture in California and served as a model for other states. George also served in numerous industry leadership roles, including: past president and multi-year director of the World Aquaculture Society; a founder and past president of the California Aquaculture Association--where I first met George; chairman of the Aquaculture Committee of the California Farm Bureau Federation; and a founding member of the U.S. Aquaculture Council. Since 2000, George has been involved in official and unofficial capacities advising USDA's National Organic Standards Board regarding the creation of organic certification standards for aquaculture. Since 2005, he has served as Chair of the Aquaculture Working Group of the USDA National Organic Program that has contributed to the development of proposed standards for farmed fish and shellfish currently working their way through the federal rulemaking process. Mr. Speaker, I know that I speak for the whole House in applauding George Lockwood's accomplishments. The world is a better place because of his efforts. We wish him, his wife, the Rev. Canon Marcia Lockwood, their four grown children and two grandchildren all the success in the world. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1491-E1492] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN HONOR OF GEORGE S.

CREC-2016-11-16-pt1-PgE1492-2,CREC-2016-11-16,114,SEX TRAFFICKERS SHOULD BE SHAMED,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1492] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SEX TRAFFICKERS SHOULD BE SHAMED ______ HON. TED POE of texas in the house of representatives Wednesday, November 16, 2016 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, one hot summer day in Houston, a single mother (we will call her Amy) met a man. At the time, Amy was lonely and struggling to make a life for her young children. He was charming, funny and a talented member of the music industry. He told her he loved her and it made her feel valued and safe. This man promised her a better life, saying that with her help, the two of them would start a thriving record label together, but in order to do this they would need to move away for awhile. He said this would be good for her future and, more importantly, her children's future. She was vulnerable, financially hurting, looking for a better life, and she trusted him. The plan was to move away for three months, and so they went. Once they moved, the man immediately changed his tune. He isolated Amy from her family and friends and became hostile and abusive. It quickly became clear to Amy that that there was no record label. Instead, she had found herself in a dangerous situation. She spent her days trapped in a dark room where men would come in one by one. She was used and abused, treated like a prostitute. She was no prostitute. She was a victim of human trafficking being held against her will. The ``appointments'' with men continued to increase. It became clear quickly to this mother that she was now a sex slave. One day, one of Amy's fellow captives being held by this man had a nervous breakdown to the point where she could no longer be physically controlled. She was a threat to his secretive business. The trafficker became distracted, and Amy was able to escape back to Houston. Her family picked her up and she returned home, but she was not the same woman that left months before. Her life was forever changed. Amy was one of the lucky ones who got away, but her story of captivity is all too common in America. Traffickers prey every day on vulnerable women, from the insecure teenager at the mall to mothers like Amy looking for a better life for their children. This modern-day slavery happens right here in Texas in plain sight at our motels, cantinas and massage parlors. The victims live among us in our communities, but behind closed doors, they are slaves living in fear. They totally lose their identity. Meanwhile, their slave traders are able to keep their lives, committing this horrendous crime anonymously and continuously. Buyers and sellers of humans want to remain anonymous because they can. Those days need to end. As a former criminal court judge in Texas, I successfully used public punishment for two purposes. First, I wanted to make sure defendants did not end up back in my courtroom. Second, I wanted to instill fear in would-be criminals to deter them from committing crimes in the first place. I believe this form of public shaming can be successful in combatting human trafficking. That is why I have introduced The SHAME Act in Congress. This legislation will give federal judges the ability to publish both the names and the photographs of both convicted human traffickers and buyers of trafficked victims. The second part of that is important--in order to effectively combat trafficking, we must go after the customers. The bill is designed to allow the public to easily access the pictures and information of those living among them in society who have purchased sex from victims. That way the buyers will no longer be able to hide in plain sight under the cloak of anonymity. Furthermore, I hope the SHAME Act strikes fear in those who think about purchasing young women for sex. Perhaps the fear of having their face on a billboard will make them think twice about participating in the modern day slave trade. Traffickers and sex abusers run a global business second only to the slave trade. Like any business, this trade is successful because of its customers and the continuous demand they provide. It is time to SHAME these horrible humans out of the business. Our children are not for sale. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1492] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SEX TRAFFICKERS SHOULD BE SHAMED ______ HON.

This man promised her a better life, saying that with her help, the two of them would start a thriving record label together, but in order to do this they would need to move away for awhile. He said this would be good for her future and, more importantly, her children's future. She was vulnerable, financially hurting, looking for a better life, and she trusted him. The plan was to move away for three months, and so they went. Once they moved, the man immediately changed his tune. He isolated Amy from her family and friends and became hostile and abusive. It quickly became clear to Amy that that there was no record label. Instead, she had found herself in a dangerous situation. She spent her days trapped in a dark room where men would come in one by one. She was used and abused, treated like a prostitute. She was no prostitute. She was a victim of human trafficking being held against her will. The ``appointments'' with men continued to increase. It became clear quickly to this mother that she was now a sex slave. One day, one of Amy's fellow captives being held by this man had a nervous breakdown to the point where she could no longer be physically controlled. She was a threat to his secretive business. The trafficker became distracted, and Amy was able to escape back to Houston. Her family picked her up and she returned home, but she was not the same woman that left months before. Her life was forever changed. Amy was one of the lucky ones who got away, but her story of captivity is all too common in America. Traffickers prey every day on vulnerable women, from the insecure teenager at the mall to mothers like Amy looking for a better life for their children. This modern-day slavery happens right here in Texas in plain sight at our motels, cantinas and massage parlors. The victims live among us in our communities, but behind closed doors, they are slaves living in fear. They totally lose their identity. Meanwhile, their slave traders are able to keep their lives, committing this horrendous crime anonymously and continuously. Buyers and sellers of humans want to remain anonymous because they can. Those days need to end. As a former criminal court judge in Texas, I successfully used public punishment for two purposes. First, I wanted to make sure defendants did not end up back in my courtroom. Second, I wanted to instill fear in would-be criminals to deter them from committing crimes in the first place. I believe this form of public shaming can be successful in combatting human trafficking. That is why I have introduced The SHAME Act in Congress. This legislation will give federal judges the ability to publish both the names and the photographs of both convicted human traffickers and buyers of trafficked victims. The second part of that is important--in order to effectively combat trafficking, we must go after the customers. The bill is designed to allow the public to easily access the pictures and information of those living among them in society who have purchased sex from victims. That way the buyers will no longer be able to hide in plain sight under the cloak of anonymity. Furthermore, I hope the SHAME Act strikes fear in those who think about purchasing young women for sex. Perhaps the fear of having their face on a billboard will make them think twice about participating in the modern day slave trade. Traffickers and sex abusers run a global business second only to the slave trade. Like any business, this trade is successful because of its customers and the continuous demand they provide. It is time to SHAME these horrible humans out of the business. Our children are not for sale. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1492] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SEX TRAFFICKERS SHOULD BE SHAMED ______ HON.

DOHERTY ______ HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING of massachusetts in the house of representatives Wednesday, November 16, 2016 Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Edward J. Doherty on the occasion of his retirement after thirty six years of outstanding public service in our criminal justice system. Ed, as he is known to all, launched his career in the district court system in 1980 as an Assistant Clerk-Magistrate in the Attleboro District Court in Attleboro, Massachusetts. He quickly moved up to become the First Assistant Clerk-Magistrate, a position in which he excelled at for seven years before being appointed by then-Governor Paul Cellucci as the Clerk-Magistrate of the Wrentham District Court. Ed is well known to all those who practiced law in Massachusetts district courts as the embodiment of public service and dedicating one's life to the greater good. In addition to his wide array of responsibilities as Clerk Magistrate, Ed also has served on the Massachusetts Association of Magistrates and Assistant Clerks' Executive Board, the board of directors of New England Sinai Hospital, the Massachusetts District Court Task Force on Security, and as a Charter member of the Advisory Committee of the Human Rights Commission, among many other legal administration and public safety organizations. Through his participation in these organizations Ed has helped to shape and influence policy across the board from domestic violence law to human rights. He has also sponsored a Courthouse Speaker Series to bring awareness to the many topics of concern facing the court and the community. Throughout his years of service, Ed has never strayed from his commitment to providing each and every dispute, warrant and issue that comes before him the attention and care they deserve. His experience in the criminal justice system, professional and personal relationships with colleagues, law enforcement officers, and other professionals has allowed Ed to become an invaluable member of the district court system in the Commonwealth. In addition, Ed has spearheaded efforts to send holiday greetings to U.S. military service members deployed around the world. His ``Court Cards for Combat'' program has brightened the holidays of tens of thousands of our troops serving bravely overseas. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise in honor of Edward Doherty, who embodies all of the best qualities of a Clerk Magistrate. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing this distinguished public servant and in wishing him the best of luck in his future endeavors. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1491] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF EDWARD J.

MICHAEL T. McCAUL of texas in the house of representatives Wednesday, November 16, 2016 Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the courage, dedication, and extraordinary career of Colonel Andrea Thompson, who retired on October 31, 2016 after 28 years in the United States Army. Colonel Thompson has spent her life devoted to others--and in defense of our great nation. In May of 1988 Andrea was commissioned into the U.S. Army, and like thousands of other selfless soldiers, stood up and said ``send me.'' She served as a skillful advisor, a steadfast leader, and a committed mentor to younger soldiers while deployed in dangerous places far from home. A career military intelligence officer, Colonel Thompson has commanded missions from the tactical to the strategic, and the result is clear: her work has made our country safer. Her career is marked by notable achievements--including leadership roles in critical combat tours and operational deployments around the world, including in Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, in the NATO Stabilization Force operations in Bosnia, as the Senior Intelligence Officer for the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and in Afghanistan as the Intelligence Directorate/J2 Chief of Staff with General [[Page E1493]] McChrystal during Operation Enduring Freedom. But Colonel Thompson's service to the United States has extended beyond the military. She was a key advisor to multiple Congressional Committees, including the first Senior Military Advisor to the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs in the U.S. House of Representatives. Colonel Thompson also served as my National Security Advisor on the Committee on Homeland Security, where she proved to be tough, honest, and relentless in her work to defend our country against emerging and persistent threats. I want to personally recognize the achievements of this patriot and thank Colonel Thompson for her dedication to duty and to the United States of America. Simply put, she embodies what is best about our country. Her grit is unquestioned, and her bedrock beliefs reflect the heart of American values. We face great challenges in this still-young century, and we must inspire new generations to be equal to the task. To that end, we need guiding lights. Colonel Thompson is one of them. She is a woman whose life is a testament to the age-old truth that we are defined by our character and by our readiness to do what is right. She has already inspired many, but it is clear that Colonel Thompson's continued example will have a ripple effect far beyond our view. For that, she deserves the thanks of a very grateful nation. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1492-E1493] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN HONOR OF AN AMERICAN PATRIOT ______ HON.

She took pride in knowing that no enemy planes were able to successfully attack her hometown. Additionally, Mrs. Hardeman became a Weather Watcher for WTOC in which she kept a detailed record of Savannah's weather for the local news station. Her love of nature extended to bird watching, observing plants, and keeping up with the changes of the seasons. Some say, she even knew the scientific name for every plant in her home. Mrs. Hardeman also loved her local sports teams, holding season passes each year to see the Georgia Bulldogs and Georgia Southern Eagles play. Mrs. Hardeman founded the Savannah Area Republican Women's club and served as its president. Now, the club is flourishing with monthly meetings and increasing membership. She also served on numerous councils and committees throughout Savannah including the Citizen's Advisory Committee to the Chatham Urban Transportation System, the John Birch Society, the Chatham County Republican Committee, the Coastal Heritage Society, Bonaventure Historical Society, Thunderbolt Garden Club, Savannah Bulldog Club, Chatham Club, and the Mighty Eighth Historical Society. Her presence lit up the Savannah community and she will surely be missed. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1493] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF PHYLLIS HARDEMAN ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 50-year career of an extraordinary leader in our community--Chief Arthur ``Artie'' Hawkins, Kensington, Maryland Volunteer Fire Department's most senior operational member. Chief Hawkins has been instrumental in developing the Kensington VFD into one of the most outstanding Departments in the region. A third-generation firefighter, Chief Hawkins began serving the Department at the age of 12 and has dedicated his life to service. Rising through the ranks, he has served as both Department Chief and as President. As a leader and a colleague, Chief Hawkins provided the start for hundreds of volunteers who have continued serving the public through the fire service, Armed Forces, and police and medical fields. Thanks to his outstanding guidance and mentorship for so many leaders, Chief Hawkins' imprint is on the work of people who are saving lives all over the globe each and every day. Chief Hawkins is more than a leader. He has played countless roles in the lives of the Department members, whether it be as a father, a brother or a friend. He has been there for them during the happiest moments of their lives as well as the saddest. Chief Hawkins truly embodies the meaning of ``brotherhood'' within the fire service. Chief Hawkins has also been a pillar of strength during critical times in our nation's history. He has played important roles in the Department's response to numerous emergencies, including the D.C. race riots of the 1960s, the 9/11 attacks on the Pentagon, and the sniper attacks that paralyzed the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area in 2002. On November 20, 2016, Chief Hawkins will lead his final regular shift on a special day--the 50th anniversary of his very first shift with the Department.

Born on January 22, 1938, in Alflora, Florida to James and Verble Hinote, Lloyd spent his first eight years in nearby Indian Ford, before moving to live the remainder of his life in his beloved Milton. Lloyd graduated as 1 of 56 students in the Milton High School Class of 1956, and after high school he matriculated to Florida State University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in management and finance. Lloyd continued his education, completing The School of Banking at the University of Oklahoma, and then embarked on a successful private sector career, working as the vice president of a local bank for over twenty-four years and as a private business owner for over eighteen years, before serving almost ten years as the executive director of the Pace Area Chamber of Commerce. In 2002, Lloyd decided to serve his community in local government by serving on the Milton City Council. On the Milton City Council, Councilman Hinote represented Ward IV for over 15 years. It was his leadership as Chairman of the Parks and Recreation committee that initiated the improvements at Sanders Street Park and Russell Harbor Landing. He was fully dedicated to bettering Milton, as evidenced by his work on the council to build a new city hall, fire station, wastewater treatment facility, and build and maintain countless recreation facilities.

He was assigned to the 10th Signal Corps of the 31st Infantry, which was operating in the Pacific Theater. When the Japanese Army invaded the island of Corregidor, Mr. Fuller was taken captive. He spent a total of three years and four months as a prisoner of war. While a prisoner, Mr. Fuller befriended a Japanese guard who wanted to learn English. The two men played baseball together and [[Page E1494]] formed an unlikely friendship. The guard helped deliver oranges and small fish to the American prisoners--the only food they had to eat besides rice. Mr. Fuller escaped from the prison camp near the end of the war. As he fled from his captors, he saw the guard who he had befriended. Mr. Fuller saluted the guard, who returned the gesture. Although the two men would never see each other again, the guard's compassion had a lasting impact on Mr. Fuller. Mr. Fuller's courage and respect for the human spirit transcended the political and cultural boundaries of his time. Despite the horrors of war, his courage and optimism shined through the darkness and demonstrated the best of the human spirit. Mr. Fuller did not tell his incredible story until 2007, when he was 93 years old. He passed away in 2010 in Penn Yan, New York. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the life and service of Earl L.

Fuller, who served our country during World War II. Mr. Fuller enlisted in the U.S. Army in February 1941 at the age of 27. He was assigned to the 10th Signal Corps of the 31st Infantry, which was operating in the Pacific Theater. When the Japanese Army invaded the island of Corregidor, Mr. Fuller was taken captive. He spent a total of three years and four months as a prisoner of war. While a prisoner, Mr. Fuller befriended a Japanese guard who wanted to learn English. The two men played baseball together and [[Page E1494]] formed an unlikely friendship. The guard helped deliver oranges and small fish to the American prisoners--the only food they had to eat besides rice. Mr. Fuller escaped from the prison camp near the end of the war. As he fled from his captors, he saw the guard who he had befriended. Mr. Fuller saluted the guard, who returned the gesture. Although the two men would never see each other again, the guard's compassion had a lasting impact on Mr. Fuller. Mr. Fuller's courage and respect for the human spirit transcended the political and cultural boundaries of his time. Despite the horrors of war, his courage and optimism shined through the darkness and demonstrated the best of the human spirit. Mr. Fuller did not tell his incredible story until 2007, when he was 93 years old. He passed away in 2010 in Penn Yan, New York. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the life and service of Earl L. Fuller--an American hero with a truly remarkable story. ____________________",package_114_207.csv,1905,1905,1979,"[congressional record volume 162, number 164 (wednesday, november 16, 2016)] [extensions of remarks] [pages e1493-e1494] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] recognizing earl l. fuller ______ hon. tom reed of new york in the house of representatives wednesday, november 16, 2016 mr. reed. mr. speaker, i rise today to recognize earl l. fuller, who served our country during world war ii. mr. fuller enlisted in the u.s. army in february 1941 at the age of 27. he was assigned to the 10th signal corps of the 31st infantry, which was operating in the pacific theater. when the japanese army invaded the island of corregidor, mr. fuller was taken captive. he spent a total of three years and four months as a prisoner of war. while a prisoner, mr. fuller befriended a japanese guard who wanted to learn english. the two men played baseball together and [[page e1494]] formed an unlikely friendship. the guard helped deliver oranges and small fish to the american prisoners--the only food they had to eat besides rice. mr. fuller escaped from the prison camp near the end of the war. as he fled from his captors, he saw the guard who he had befriended. mr. fuller saluted the guard, who returned the gesture. although the two men would never see each other again, the guard's compassion had a lasting impact on mr. fuller. mr. fuller's courage and respect for the human spirit transcended the political and cultural boundaries of his time. despite the horrors of war, his courage and optimism shined through the darkness and demonstrated the best of the human spirit. mr. fuller did not tell his incredible story until 2007, when he was 93 years old. he passed away in 2010 in penn yan, new york. i ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the life and service of earl l. fuller--an american hero with a truly remarkable story. ____________________",1905

I was pleased to join in the celebration of the milestone anniversary in our community. Since 1976, the Jamaican Social Club has served northwest Ohio and southern Michigan as an organization dedicated to charity, education, social and scientific purposes. Since its inception, the Jamaican Social Club has promoted a better understanding and cooperation among all cultures and citizens in the region. Almost one year after being founded as a non-profit, multicultural organization in the State of Ohio, the Hon. Harry Kessler, Mayor of the City of Toledo at the time, proclaimed the first week in August ``Jamaican Independence Week'' and called upon citizens of Toledo to join the organization in celebration. The Jamaican Social Club has given consistently of its time and talents over the past 40 years and has donated hundreds of volunteer hours each year to assist those in need. For example, at the devastation of Hurricane Gilbert in Jamaica, the Jamaican Social Club, through its support from General Mills, donated one trailer load of cereals to hurricane victims in Jamaica. Two truck-loads of hospital beds and equipment, donations by Toledo area hospitals, were shipped to two hospitals in Jamaica. In addition, athletic uniforms and equipment, books and pencils have been donated to several schools in Jamaica, including four computers, which were donated to Trench Town School in Kingston and one to Harry Watch School in Manchester, Jamaica. Over the years, several scholarships have been awarded to high school students in the Toledo area for excellent achievement, and the organization sponsors a ``Dreams for Teens'' TV talent show designed to enhance students with exceptional ability to perform competitively. Winners of this talent competition are offered prizes and scholarships. Periodic donations are made to Toledo's homeless shelters as well. The Jamaican Social Club serves as a liaison between the Citizens of Toledo and its authorities and the people and Government of Jamaica, and offers assistance to newly arrived immigrants to get adjusted in their communities. The Jamaican Social Club has hosted several Jamaican diplomats as well as many other guests from Jamaica; Toronto, Canada; Baltimore, MD; New York, NY; and Indianapolis. IN; to the city of Toledo. We offer our heartiest congratulations to the Jamaican Social Club for its rich history and wonderful contributions to our region over the last 40 years. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1494] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMMEMORATING THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE JAMAICAN SOCIAL CLUB ______ HON.

THOMPSON ______ HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK of virginia in the house of representatives Wednesday, November 16, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to honor the life of Ms. Elaine E. Thompson of Hamilton, Virginia. Throughout her life, Ms. Thompson was a respected leader in her community and a notable historian of African American culture in Loudoun County. Coming from a family of educators, I applaud Ms. Thompson's dedication to the search for knowledge throughout her life as teacher, historian, author, and speaker. Ms. Thompson led many successful efforts to advance the recognition and preservation of African American history. Aside from her numerous contributions of written work on the subject, she was instrumental in the founding of the Thomas Balch Library's Black History Committee, and the establishment of the historic highway marker at the Emancipation Grounds in Purcellville, Virginia. Ms. Thompson was a role model and mentor for many in the community. Most recently, she left her mark on African American history through her contribution of Joseph Trammell's freedom certificate to the Museum of African American History and Culture. Joseph Trammell, a freed slave who was buried in Lincoln, Virginia, was an ancestor of Ms. Thompson. In 2014, she donated Mr. Trammell's freedom certificate to the National Museum of African American History and Culture. One of the last joys of her life was to see her gift at the museum's opening and to be an invited guest at the Dedication Ceremony and Gala. Her selfless legacy will forever be a part of the history of Loudoun County and the nation as a whole. Elaine was quiet but passionate, resolute and firm in her convictions. She lavished love, affection, and gifts on family members and friends. She also gently shared her displeasure if someone disappointed her. After her retirement, Elaine dedicated her time to caring for her parents in their declining years. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in celebrating the life of, and bidding farewell to, Elaine E. Thompson. May she rest in peace, and her family be comforted. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1494] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE OF ELAINE E.

FRANK PALLONE, JR. of new jersey in the house of representatives Wednesday, November 16, 2016 Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Long Branch Free Public Library as its administration, Board of Trustees, members and the Long Branch community celebrates its 100th anniversary this year. Its commitment to serving the community is truly deserving of this body's recognition on this significant milestone. Throughout its history, the Long Branch Free Public Library has supported and been supported by the community. At the proposal by a group of thirty local women, the Long Branch Free Public Library got its start in 1878 as The East Long Branch Reading Room & Library Association. For 38 years, The East Long Branch Reading Room & Library Association was operated by the group until they turned it over to the City of Long Branch in 1916 as a requisite for a Carnegie Corporation grant for a new library that city residents had approved via referendum that November. Since its founding, the Long Branch Free Public Library has been an integral part of the Long Branch community and maintains outstanding resources and accessibility for its patrons. Over the years, the library continued to grow, expanding to a second branch in the Elberon section of Long Branch and currently averages 10,000 visits per month. It has [[Page E1495]] evolved with technology and the changing needs of its patrons, providing computers and free Wi-Fi access, career services, research assistance, literacy and citizenship classes, and homebound library services among many other vital services. The Long Branch Free Public Library also serves as a place for the community to come together, offering programs for children and young adults, book clubs, cultural events, historical programs and activities for all ages. The Long Branch Free Public Library is a welcome place for the community to share and has been recognized for its efforts to offer an outstanding space for learning and civic involvement. It was selected by Asbury Park Press readers as one of the Best Libraries in Monmouth County in 2015 and received the 2014 New Jersey State Library Innovation Award.

FRANK PALLONE, JR. of new jersey in the house of representatives Wednesday, November 16, 2016 Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Long Branch Free Public Library as its administration, Board of Trustees, members and the Long Branch community celebrates its 100th anniversary this year. Its commitment to serving the community is truly deserving of this body's recognition on this significant milestone. Throughout its history, the Long Branch Free Public Library has supported and been supported by the community. At the proposal by a group of thirty local women, the Long Branch Free Public Library got its start in 1878 as The East Long Branch Reading Room & Library Association. For 38 years, The East Long Branch Reading Room & Library Association was operated by the group until they turned it over to the City of Long Branch in 1916 as a requisite for a Carnegie Corporation grant for a new library that city residents had approved via referendum that November. Since its founding, the Long Branch Free Public Library has been an integral part of the Long Branch community and maintains outstanding resources and accessibility for its patrons. Over the years, the library continued to grow, expanding to a second branch in the Elberon section of Long Branch and currently averages 10,000 visits per month. It has [[Page E1495]] evolved with technology and the changing needs of its patrons, providing computers and free Wi-Fi access, career services, research assistance, literacy and citizenship classes, and homebound library services among many other vital services. The Long Branch Free Public Library also serves as a place for the community to come together, offering programs for children and young adults, book clubs, cultural events, historical programs and activities for all ages. The Long Branch Free Public Library is a welcome place for the community to share and has been recognized for its efforts to offer an outstanding space for learning and civic involvement. It was selected by Asbury Park Press readers as one of the Best Libraries in Monmouth County in 2015 and received the 2014 New Jersey State Library Innovation Award.

JUAN VARGAS of california in the house of representatives Wednesday, November 16, 2016 Mr. VARGAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Ramon `Chunky' Sanchez, an exceptional musician and activist for the community of San Diego. Chunky Sanchez passed away on Friday, October 28, 2016, a few days before his sixty-fifth birthday. Chunky Sanchez was born in 1951 in Blythe, California to Mexican immigrant parents. He was a talented musician, who was taught traditional Mexican music by his mother and uncles. Chunky Sanchez quickly learned how to sing, play ten different instruments, and compose his own music. In 1969 he attended San Diego State University on a scholarship and began performing with La Rondalla Amerindia de Aztlan, a noted musical group composed of students and professors. Later, Chunky Sanchez became a vocalist for the folklore group Los Alcranes (The Scorpions) which he co-founded along with his brother Ricardo. They recorded their first album in 1977. Through his music, he would tell the story of the Chicano movement and of the Mexican American bi-cultural experience. Chunky Sanchez was so well received that labor leader Cesar Chavez would often invite him to play at union rallies. Chunky Sanchez was also an incredibly active member of the San Diego community. In his song `Rising Souls', he sang that we needed to `educate, not incarcerate, so that humanity will shine.' During his lifetime he embodied these lyrics as he worked with local youth as a coach, an educator, a youth center director, and a gang intervention counselor. His passion and care for the community garnered numerous awards and honors from organizations across California and throughout the City of San Diego. Chunky Sanchez is best known for his song ``Chicano Park Samba'', which narrated the struggle for and successful creation of Chicano Park in San Diego. A City Historic Landmark, Chicano Park honors the history of the Chicano Mexican people through monumental murals, sculptures, earthworks, and an architectural piece. Earlier in the 114th Congress, I introduced H.R. 3711, the Chicano Park Preservation Act to preserve Chicano Park as part of the National Historic system. Coincidentally, this bill is being marked up by the House Natural Resources Committee later today. I would like to thank Chairman Bishop and Ranking Member Grijalva for supporting this legislation. It's a fitting way to honor Ramon `Chunky' Sanchez's memory. Ramon Chunky Sanchez will be missed by his family--his wife Isabel, five children, many grandchildren and the San Diego community. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the lyrics of the Chicano Park Samba. Chicano Park Samba Lyrics Los Alacranes Mojados: Chunky Sanchez, Ricardo Sanchez, Mario Aguilar, Marco Antonio Rodriguez In the year the year 1970, in the city of San Diego, under the Coronado Bridge, lied a little piece of land, a piece of land that the community of Logan Heights wanted to make into a park . . . A park where all the chavalitos could play in so they wouldn't have to play in the street and get run over by a car . . . a park where all the viejitos could come and just sit down and watch the sun go down in the tarde . . . a park where all the familias could come and just get together on a Sunday afternoon and celebrate the spirit of life itself. But the city of San Diego said, ``Chale. We're going to make a highway patrol substation here, man.'' So on April 22nd, 1970, la raza of Logan Heights and other Chicano communities of San Diego got together, and they organized . . . and they walked on the land, and they took it over with their picks and their shovels and they began to build their park. And today, that little piece of land under the Coronado Bridge is known to everybody . . . as Chicano Park . . . Orale!

Taylorville hosts five International Chilli Society cook-offs every year, in addition to numerous local and regional events. Each summer, Taylorville is home to the Christian County Ag Fair's chilli cookoff and in October, Taylorville hosts its own ``Chillinois Regional'' Chillifest. Annually, these competitions bring twelve chilli-cooking world champions to Taylorville and as many as ten thousand chilli connoisseurs. Earlier this year, the Illinois General Assembly passed H.R. 1357, which officially named Taylorville the Chilli Capital of Illinois. I am very proud of my hometown and I would like to commend Mayor Brotherton and the City of Taylorville on this distinction.

Taylorville hosts five International Chilli Society cook-offs every year, in addition to numerous local and regional events. Each summer, Taylorville is home to the Christian County Ag Fair's chilli cookoff and in October, Taylorville hosts its own ``Chillinois Regional'' Chillifest. Annually, these competitions bring twelve chilli-cooking world champions to Taylorville and as many as ten thousand chilli connoisseurs. Earlier this year, the Illinois General Assembly passed H.R. 1357, which officially named Taylorville the Chilli Capital of Illinois. I am very proud of my hometown and I would like to commend Mayor Brotherton and the City of Taylorville on this distinction. I look forward to celebrating many more years as the state's chilli capital. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1495] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRATULATING TAYLORVILLE AS THE CHILLI CAPITAL OF ILLINOIS ______ HON.

CREC-2016-11-16-pt1-PgE1496-3,CREC-2016-11-16,114,CELEBRATING 50 YEARS OF THE COMMISSION ON ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1496] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CELEBRATING 50 YEARS OF THE COMMISSION ON ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY ______ HON. LOU BARLETTA of pennsylvania in the house of representatives Wednesday, November 16, 2016 Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, it's my honor to recognize the Commission on Economic Opportunity (CEO) which is celebrating its 50th Anniversary this year. With the mission of promoting self-sufficiency among low- income and vulnerable populations by confronting the causes and reducing the effects of poverty, CEO has consistently advanced the wellbeing of my constituents and our community in Northeastern Pennsylvania. The Commission on Economic Opportunity was established in 1966 as a multi-service, nonprofit organization. With its central office in Wilkes-Barre, CEO has expanded to include offices throughout my district in Hazleton, Tunkhannock, and Kingston. CEO operates more than 20 community development programs, and, with over 150 full and part- time employees, their work serves over 32,000 individuals in Northeastern Pennsylvania each year. CEO's ability to adapt to the changing nature of poverty has been a key part of their success, and this allows them to use flexible and local solutions to promote self- sufficiency in our region. When I was mayor, I worked with Gene Brady and CEO to develop the Pine Street neighborhood in Hazleton. This area was in need of renovation, and after a four block section of land was donated, Gene and I brought the community together to build single-family homes. Staying true to their mission, CEO helped these families take control of their mortgages and become self-sufficient homeowners. Over ten years later, the Pine Street neighborhood is still thriving thanks to the work of Gene and all of the employees and volunteers at CEO, and this truly exemplifies their ability to increase the standard of living for all. As a father of four and grandfather of four, I recognize the importance of providing our children with every opportunity to succeed. That's why I am grateful that an organization like CEO has taken a leading role in creating child and family-centered services in my district to ensure that the challenges of poverty do not limit anyone's potential. The Commission on Economic Opportunity also understands the need for strategic partnerships to address the root causes of poverty. Their efforts to provide funding and leadership for groups such as Luzerne County Head Start, the Child Development Council of NEPA, Rural Health Corporation of NEPA, and Maternal and Family Services of NEPA, have allowed them to reach the community at large, while efficiently using their resources to establish more low-income organizations in the region. The Monsignor Andrew J. McGowan Center for Healthy Living exemplifies their strategic partnerships, as they utilize their own Weinberg Food Bank to store and distribute food to a network of regional agencies, with the intent of helping people go ``from hungry to healthy.'' Mr. Speaker, with 50 years of successful service in Northeastern Pennsylvania, the Commission on Economic Opportunity has consistently set an example of what can be achieved when a private organization engages with their community. On behalf of my constituents, I want to thank the board of directors, staff, and volunteers that have worked tirelessly to make their goal of ``People Helping People'' possible, and I look forward to their continued success in Northeastern Pennsylvania. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1496] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CELEBRATING 50 YEARS OF THE COMMISSION ON ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY ______ HON.

BARBARA COMSTOCK of virginia in the house of representatives Wednesday, November 16, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to honor the life of Mrs. Gertrude ``Gertie'' Mae Smith Fletcher of Ashburn, Virginia. Throughout her life, Mrs. Fletcher was a respected leader in the community as she and her husband Charlie were founding members of Ashburn Volunteer Fire and Rescue Department. Her dedicated service has kept the people of the Ashburn community safe for over 60 years. One morning in 1947, Gertrude was busy preparing for an event at the fire station when an alarm was dispatched. Her brother-in-law, Carly Fletcher, was the only fireman that responded to answer the call that morning. Realizing that he may need help in this situation, Carly called for Mrs. Fletcher to get in the [[Page E1496]] truck with him and promptly deputized her as a volunteer firefighter. Ever since that day, Mrs. Fletcher supported the Ashburn Volunteer Fire and Rescue Department through her service as an officer of the Ladies Auxiliary. Her selfless legacy will forever be a part of both organizations. Always willing to lend a hand to a neighbor in need, Gertie was an irreplaceable pillar of our community. Mrs. Fletcher was active in all phases of community life in Ashburn, from her leadership at the Calvary Baptist Church to her role in forming the Blue Ridge Speech and Hearing Center. She always worked tirelessly to better her community. Mrs. Fletcher is survived by her son, Tom Fletcher, two grandchildren, Brian and Catherine, and two great-grandchildren, Taryn and Brock and a sister, Aileen. She will be missed by the countless lives she has touched over her years of public service. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in celebrating the life of, and bidding farewell to, Gertrude Mae Smith Fletcher. May she rest in peace, and her family be comforted. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1495-E1496] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE OF GERTIE FLETCHER ______ HON.

One morning in 1947, Gertrude was busy preparing for an event at the fire station when an alarm was dispatched. Her brother-in-law, Carly Fletcher, was the only fireman that responded to answer the call that morning. Realizing that he may need help in this situation, Carly called for Mrs. Fletcher to get in the [[Page E1496]] truck with him and promptly deputized her as a volunteer firefighter. Ever since that day, Mrs. Fletcher supported the Ashburn Volunteer Fire and Rescue Department through her service as an officer of the Ladies Auxiliary. Her selfless legacy will forever be a part of both organizations. Always willing to lend a hand to a neighbor in need, Gertie was an irreplaceable pillar of our community. Mrs. Fletcher was active in all phases of community life in Ashburn, from her leadership at the Calvary Baptist Church to her role in forming the Blue Ridge Speech and Hearing Center. She always worked tirelessly to better her community. Mrs. Fletcher is survived by her son, Tom Fletcher, two grandchildren, Brian and Catherine, and two great-grandchildren, Taryn and Brock and a sister, Aileen. She will be missed by the countless lives she has touched over her years of public service.

HAROLD ROGERS of kentucky in the house of representatives Wednesday, November 16, 2016 Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to my good friend, George Flynn, who is retiring after nearly 30 years of dedicated public service as Pulaski County Circuit Clerk in Somerset, Kentucky. George has honorably served as Circuit Clerk since winning his first election in 1987. Since then, he has proven to be one of the most beloved and respected leaders in the county with his unmatched work ethic and quick wit. Everyone ``south of the river'' in Pulaski County is related to George, or claims to be, and his support has never wavered. Whether you have known George for five minutes or fifty years, he treats you like family, earning him a loyalty with friends in and out of the political arena. He always has a personal story to share-- and at a moment's notice, he can rattle off the history of Pulaski County, along with the genealogy of nearly every family in town. He has never been one to pass through with a quick hello--but genuinely inquires about the well-being of friends and family. Over the last three decades, George has brought the Pulaski County Circuit Clerk's office up to speed with 21st century technology-- overseeing the digitization of thousands of records and managing growing court dockets on a daily basis. His operation is top-notch. Outside of the clerk's office, his volunteer service has been second to none. From the Lake Cumberland Friends Association, to the Boy Scouts of America, to the Ducks Unlimited Club and the Pulaski County Lincoln Club--his tireless efforts to improve local quality of life expands across the Lake Cumberland region. Everyone is equipped with the same components to make a difference in their community, but it is only those with the courage of conviction and dedication, like George Flynn, who will leave a legacy of community service, such as he has done. My wife, Cynthia, and I wish George and his wife, Resa, many years of joy and good health in their retirement. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1497] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO GEORGE FLYNN ______ HON.

BARBARA COMSTOCK of virginia in the house of representatives Wednesday, November 16, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to remember my constituent Carolyn ``Su'' Allen Saunders Webb from Loudoun County, Virginia. Mrs. Webb was well known throughout the community for her passion and dedication to park conservation. She was an individual committed to protecting the landmarks that make up Virginia's beautiful and historic Loudoun County. Mrs. Webb earned recognition through her preservation efforts on the Piedmont Environmental Council, Aldie Heritage Association, and the Lovettsville Park Advisory Board. She was one of the foremost preservation leaders in Loudoun County, and her tireless efforts can be seen throughout our great Commonwealth. As a long-serving newspaperwoman, Mrs. Webb consistently focused her energy on the local community by keeping Loudoun County informed. Additionally, she served on the Loudoun County Parks, Recreation and Open Space Advisory Board for over 20 years. Few individuals have had such a sterling record of protecting their community's resources. Clearly, Mrs. Webb's unrelenting belief in preservation gave her the strength to protect the community she loved until her passing. Mrs. Webb led the way in founding the Farm Museum at Claude Moore Park in Sterling, Virginia, as well as the transfer of the Historic Mt. Zion Church and Aldie Mill Park to the protection of NOVA Parks. For her actions she was named the 2012 Heritage Hero by the Mosby Heritage Association and was inducted as a Loudoun Laurel. Mrs. Webb is survived by her sister and brother-in-law Sally and Richard Garrison, her daughter and son-in-law Anne and Steve Fabry, her aunt Mary Hirschi, and the Hirschi and Carey cousins. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to highlight the life and legacy of Su Webb and the impact she had on our district. I ask that my colleagues join me in remembering Mrs. Webb on her commitment to natural and historical preservation in Loudoun County.

ZOE LOFGREN of california in the house of representatives Wednesday, November 16, 2016 Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today together with my colleagues, Congress members Anna Eshoo and Mike Honda to acknowledge the Silicon Valley Council of Nonprofits (SVCN). As is widely known, Santa [[Page E1498]] Clara County, particularly Silicon Valley, receives worldwide attention for its technological innovation, but Silicon Valley's innovative spirit is not limited to technology, it also extends to public/private partnerships and the nonprofit sector. The Silicon Valley Council of Nonprofits (SVCN) was founded in 1996 to represent the local community interests of nonprofits in Santa Clara County. Its mission is to continue to foster and magnify the influence and contribution of nonprofit agencies and businesses in Santa Clara County. SVCN achieves this mission with a broadly diverse approach, which includes policy work and advocacy, community partnerships and alliances, and budget and leadership development. This approach is second to none, when compared to other common Organizational Development groups, namely because it participates in the public and private sectors to leverage the effectiveness and impact of nonprofits. SVCN has a network of 200 member agencies which serve as a vital catalyst for building and maintaining nonprofit leaders, partners and collaborators. Furthermore, it is an integral and unifying voice for health and human service agencies in Santa Clara County. SVCN focuses on building alliances and partnerships to increase the effectiveness of nonprofits. It increases the capacity of nonprofits through trainings, summits and skill building programs that make nonprofits more effective and it encourages nonprofit leaders to be better advocates for their system of care and serve as spokespersons at public forums; hearings, and developing meaningful relationships by participating with local elected and government officials at key decision making tables. When SVCN achieves its goals, it benefits the entire nonprofit sector and ultimately our community, particularly those individuals and families who are disenfranchised and find themselves struggling to meet even their most basic needs of housing, healthcare, food and education. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the Silicon Valley Council of Nonprofits, for its 20 years of extraordinary leadership and advocacy in the nonprofit sector. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1497-E1498] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SILICON VALLEY COUNCIL OF NONPROFITS ______ HON.

LOU BARLETTA of pennsylvania in the house of representatives Wednesday, November 16, 2016 Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, it's my honor to recognize The Standard- Speaker, which is celebrating its 150th Anniversary this year. With a humble beginning in my hometown of Hazleton, The Standard-Speaker has provided generations of my constituents with reliable and current news in Northeastern Pennsylvania. It is hard to imagine what our city would be like without The Standard-Speaker to keep us informed. When I was mayor for more than ten years, the newspaper was always there on my front step in the mornings, and the reporters and editors would be weighing in letting me know how I was doing. Now that I am a member of Congress, The Standard- Speaker is still a good barometer of what is happening at home and what the people are thinking about. The Standard-Speaker has a long and proud history. It was founded in 1866 as The Hazleton Sentinel, and after numerous ownership changes during the late 1800s and early 1900s, the paper was eventually purchased by former Hazleton Treasurer Henry Walser. For a time, there were three publications in Hazleton: The Plain Speaker, the Daily Standard, and The Hazleton Sentinel. After acquiring the Daily Standard in 1917 to create The Standard-Sentinel, Henry Walser and his new partner, John R. Dershuck, combined their efforts to bring The Standard-Sentinel and The Plain Speaker under one roof in 1961. Ownership was eventually consolidated in the hands of Henry's son, Frank, who merged not just the morning and afternoon papers, but also their names, to give rise to the all-day publication, The Standard- Speaker. Staying true to the paper's heritage of family ownership and strategic mergers, in April of 2007, it was announced that the Lynett and Haggerty families of Scranton would purchase the paper. The company already owned The Citizens' Voice in Wilkes-Barre, The Times-Tribune in Scranton, and The Republican & Herald in Pottsville, which made The Standard-Speaker a natural fit for their vision of treating Northeastern Pennsylvania as a single region in which Hazleton occupies a unique spot. Mr. Speaker, for more than a century, The Standard-Speaker has been an integral part of the community in Northeastern Pennsylvania. Generations of families have not only relied on the paper for their daily news, but have been the ones working to produce it. I am incredibly grateful for the work of all the employees that make The Standard-Speaker so special, and I look forward to the paper's continued success and innovation in the years to come.

G. K. BUTTERFIELD of north carolina in the house of representatives Wednesday, November 16, 2016 Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the sesquicentennial anniversary of Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church, located in my congressional district in Henderson, North Carolina. Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church was founded in 1866, three years after the Emancipation Proclamation was signed by President Abraham Lincoln and months following the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution. The Church property was acquired by its members for religious worship, and has since remained a place of worship and fellowship for the Henderson/Vance County community and other surrounding areas in eastern North Carolina. In the Church's early days, both Methodists and Baptists worshipped in the same building, but in 1867, the membership had grown so significantly that the two denominations agreed that the Baptists would buy the Methodists' share of the property. Under the leadership of Reverend Jefferson Burwell and Mr. Aaron Pratcher, Shiloh Baptist Church proceeded to organize a place of worship on one acre of land located in Henderson. Mr. Speaker, much of Shiloh Baptist Church's growth over the years can be attributed to its dedicated leadership and congregation. In 1985, Reverend Richard I. Walden led the Church to a larger building to accommodate the growing congregation. With Reverend C. R. Mitchell as pastor in 1967, the Church saw the erection of a new Sanctuary and Educational Department. In October 2002, Shiloh further expanded with a new multipurpose building that was named in honor of Shiloh's church mother, Mother Johnnie Young Mims Sanders. Since 1995, Shiloh has been pastored by Reverend Joseph L. Ratliff. Today, Shiloh Baptist Church remains a pillar of the Henderson community and in the state of North Carolina. The Church remains active in its community, serving as a longtime partner of the Food Bank of North Carolina. As a member of the food pantry, Shiloh serves over 975 households and over 2,280 individuals each month. Shiloh has also partnered with area churches to provide school supplies to students and Christmas food boxes to over 225 families annually. Shiloh Baptist Church's 150th anniversary observes the labor and dedication over 150 years as well as the Church's promise for the future. By the grace of God, Shiloh Baptist Church's outstanding leadership and devoted congregation have allowed for significant growth in membership and ministry and continued outreach in the community. Mr. Speaker, I celebrate the rich history of Shiloh Baptist Church in Henderson, North Carolina, and I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating Reverend Ratliff, the congregation, and the residents of Henderson on this historic milestone. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1499] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMMEMORATING THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF SHILOH BAPTIST CHURCH ______ HON.

BARBARA COMSTOCK of virginia in the house of representatives Wednesday, November 16, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I would like to honor the 25th anniversary of Old Dominion Cotillion. Established in 1991, Old Dominion Cotillion has worked tirelessly to educate young women about how to conduct themselves with grace and poise, as well as the value of community service. Old Dominion Cotillion is an all-volunteer, nonprofit women's social organization founded by Sherry Clark Pressley of Vienna, Virginia. Her original vision, along with friends Alice Cromarty, Lisa Alexander and Lynn Williams, was to establish an organization of families working together to expand their daughters' knowledge and confidence to deal with their future adult lives. The work done by the women of Old Dominion Cotillion has helped shape the lives of countless young women who will serve as the leaders of tomorrow. The ODC's commitment to the community can be seen not only through their efforts to prepare young women for adulthood, but also through their service efforts.

Apprenticeship programs are mutually beneficial for employers and job-seekers. They connect well-qualified, trained employees with meaningful, high paying jobs for fulfilling lives. They have played a critical role in the successes companies across South Carolina, such as BMW, Michelin, Bridgestone, MTU America, Boeing, Blue Cross Blue Shield, and Volvo. Quality education and training is vital for competing in the workplace and I am grateful to Apprenticeship Carolina, led by Director Brad Neese, for their work in creating jobs. I appreciate that the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act passed the House in September.

Mr. Speaker, only in Washington could it make sense to heap praise and award a bonus to a contractor just two weeks before you try to cancel their contract. That's exactly what the Department of Justice (DOD and Bureau of Prisons (BOP) are trying to do in my district to the D. Ray James Correctional Facility in Folkston, Georgia. Despite the fact that D. Ray James has been rated ``superior'' by BOP in each of the last three years, and operates $3,000 more efficiently per inmate than its federal peers, bureaucrats at the DOJ and BOP are threatening to shut it down. This stems from an unsubstantiated DOJ report that admits they didn't study several critical factors during their review, and a politically motivated attempt to shut down prisons holding illegal aliens, with no plan on how to deal with them. In the balance are nearly 500 jobs in my district and thousands more across the county. To make matters worse, the BOP extended D. Ray James' contract just a day before trying to go back on its word. Better yet, the author of the report--Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates--and officials from the Bureau of Prisons are refusing to take my call to explain their actions or answer my questions. The simple truth is the facts do not support their conclusion and they are afraid to admit it. The American people are sick and tired of a bureaucracy run amok and there is perhaps no better example than this, from the same Administration that accidentally gave more than 1800 illegal aliens bound for deportation full American citizenship last year. I call on the BOP and DOJ to honor their commitment to the outstanding employees at D. Ray James and at private correctional facilities across the county. It's time for them to stop stonewalling the efforts of Congress to hold them accountable for their actions. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 164 (Wednesday, November 16, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1500] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SUPPORTING THE D.
