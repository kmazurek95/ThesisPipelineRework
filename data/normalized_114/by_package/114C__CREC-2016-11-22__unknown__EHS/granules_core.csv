BOBBY SEALE,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 22, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1523] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING MR. BOBBY SEALE ______ HON. BARBARA LEE of california in the house of representatives Tuesday, November 22, 2016 Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Bobby Seale on the momentous occasion of his 80th birthday. Mr. Seale has had an incredible career in political activism and community service, dedicating his life to advocating for the rights and betterment of African-Americans across the nation. Born in Texas in 1936, Mr. Seale grew up entrenched in poverty. After moving around in Texas, living in Dallas, San Antonio, and Port Arthur, Mr. Seale's family finally relocated to Oakland, California, when Mr. Seale was eight years old. Mr. Seale attended Berkeley High School, where he started to become politically active. In 1955, Mr. Seale dropped out of high school and joined the United States Air Force. After his military service, Mr. Seale worked as a sheet metal mechanic while earning his high school diploma at night. After earning his high school diploma, Mr. Seale went on to attend Merritt College, where he intended to study engineering. However, during his time at Merritt College, he began to take a deep interest in politics and black history, and joined the Afro-American Association (AAA), a campus group advocating for black separatism. It was through the AAA that Mr. Seale met Mr. Huey P. Newton, a kindred spirit. They quickly became friends and their political activism deepened as they were inspired by the teachings of Malcolm X. During this time, Mr. Seale was also inspired to give back to his community, spending time teaching youths about black history and personal responsibility at the North Oakland Neighborhood Anti-Poverty Center. By October 1966, Mr. Seale and Mr. Newton were ready to organize their beliefs and put them into practice, and they formed the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense. Originally formed to protect the African-American community in Oakland from police brutality, the Black Panthers rejected the nonviolent approach of the mainstream Civil Rights Movement. The Black Panthers also focused on serving the community, cooking free breakfast for children before school, distributing clothing, and teaching classes on politics and economics. A few years later, in 1970, Mr. Seale was arrested in Chicago during a protest at the Democratic National Convention, and he was ultimately sentenced to four years in prison for contempt of court. After his release from prison in 1973, Mr. Seale renounced violence as a means to an end and decided to run for Mayor of Oakland. He finished second out of nine candidates. In 1974, Mr. Seale resigned as Chairman of the Black Panther Party, having grown tired of politics. He has remained active in the community, writing books and working to improve social services and educational opportunities in black neighborhoods. On a personal note, I am deeply grateful for ``the Chairman's'' brilliance and leadership. He was a mentor, a colleague, but most importantly, a true friend. My late beloved mother, Ms. Mildred Massey, was one of Bobby's strongest supporters and believed in him and the Black Panther Party as the ``vanguard of the movement.'' He taught us the importance of grassroots organizing by knocking on doors, walking precincts, and phone banking to communicate our position on issues and most importantly, how to be a true public servant. Today, California's 13th Congressional District celebrates the extraordinary life and service of Mr. Bobby Seale and wishes him a very happy birthday and a life that continues to be filled with peace and happiness and fulfilled by the great work and leadership he continues to provide. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 22, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1523] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING MR.

BARBARA LEE of california in the house of representatives Tuesday, November 22, 2016 Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the extraordinary career of Judge Gordon Baranco. I would like to congratulate him on his retirement and thank him for his invaluable service to our community. Born and raised in Oakland, California, Gordon graduated from Oakland High School in 1965. Gordon would become a star basketball player at the University of California, Davis, where he led the Aggies to win three league championships. Gordon's time spent at UC Davis would coincide with the Vietnam War and the Civil Rights Movement. This time in Gordon's life was critical to his academic and civic development, opening his eyes to injustices here in the United States and abroad. In 1969, Gordon graduated from UC Davis with a bachelor's degree in political science. Inspired by the idea that the law could be a vehicle to change society, he went on to enroll in law school. He graduated from the King School of Law at UC Davis in 1972. As an attorney, Gordon practiced as a Graduate Legal Assistant in the office of the California State Attorney General; a Deputy District Attorney in the office of the San Francisco District Attorney; as managing Attorney for the San Francisco Neighborhood Legal Assistance Foundation, and Assistant to the City Attorney in Oakland. At the young age of 32 he was made the Honorable Gordon Baranco, appointed to the Oakland Piedmont Emeryville Municipal Court by Governor Edmund G. Brown, Jr. After serving as presiding judge of the court, he was appointed by Governor George Deukmejian as a judge of the Alameda County Superior Court. In 2004, Judge Baranco was instrumental in establishing the Alameda County Homeless and Caring Court, which provides a much needed alternative to the traditional criminal justice court system for the homeless. On a personal note, Judge Baranco worked with me and helped lead our record remedy and expungement conferences for several years. Because of his boldness and commitment, many returning citizens have been able to move forward with their lives without the troubles of their past once their parole is completed. For this, I, along with so many others, am deeply grateful. On behalf of the residents of California's 13th Congressional District, Judge Gordon Baranco, salute you. I thank you for a lifetime of service and congratulate you on your achievements. I wish you and your loved ones the very best as you enjoy your well-deserved retirement. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 22, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1523] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING JUDGE GORDON BARANCO ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Zion First Church of God in Christ located in Oakland, California upon its 100th anniversary as a strong religious pillar in the East Bay Community. After moving to California from Louisiana, Zion First Church of God in Christ was founded in 1916 by Samuel Harrison and was the first Church of God in Christ in Northern California. It was created with the vision to expand the ministry and establish a legacy of spirituality through faith. Under the leadership of Pastor Harrison, the church thrived and soon needed a building to accommodate its growing membership. In 1921, the church purchased its first building purchase in West Oakland and became a strong faith center for the West Oakland community. During the 1940's, as African Americans migrated to the West for industrial jobs, many families settled in West Oakland. Worship services immediately grew and were so inspirational it was said that people would hang out of their windows to see what was going on in the services. On January 25, 1977 Pastor Willie E. Pearls was ushered in as the second leader of Zion First Church of God in Christ. Pastor Pearls had moved to California. In 1978, Zion First upgraded its building to make room for its growing membership. Pastor Pearls moved to California in 1952 and joined Zion. First, serving for many years as a youth leader, Deacon, and a special helper to Overseer Harrison before accepting the role as senior pastor. Pastor Pearls carried on the original vision of the church, helping the community, by giving away food, clothing the homeless, and serving hot breakfast every Sunday to the community. [[Page E1524]] In 2003, after 33 years of service, Pastor Pearls stepped down and the church elected Pastor Rickie L. Williams. Under his leadership, the church has continued to faithfully serve the West Oakland community through various outreach programs. Although the church was ravaged by fire in September 2013, the congregation bonded together and rebuilt the church on the same property to continue its ministry in the West Oakland community. On behalf of the residents of California's 13th Congressional District, I extend my sincerest congratulations to Zion First Church of God in Christ on the celebration of its 100th year of worship. I wish Zion First Church of God in Christ many more years of authentic and compassionate service. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 22, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1523-E1524] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING ZION FIRST CHURCH OF GOD IN CHRIST ______ HON.

Pearls was ushered in as the second leader of Zion First Church of God in Christ. Pastor Pearls had moved to California. In 1978, Zion First upgraded its building to make room for its growing membership. Pastor Pearls moved to California in 1952 and joined Zion. First, serving for many years as a youth leader, Deacon, and a special helper to Overseer Harrison before accepting the role as senior pastor. Pastor Pearls carried on the original vision of the church, helping the community, by giving away food, clothing the homeless, and serving hot breakfast every Sunday to the community. [[Page E1524]] In 2003, after 33 years of service, Pastor Pearls stepped down and the church elected Pastor Rickie L. Williams. Under his leadership, the church has continued to faithfully serve the West Oakland community through various outreach programs. Although the church was ravaged by fire in September 2013, the congregation bonded together and rebuilt the church on the same property to continue its ministry in the West Oakland community. On behalf of the residents of California's 13th Congressional District, I extend my sincerest congratulations to Zion First Church of God in Christ on the celebration of its 100th year of worship. I wish Zion First Church of God in Christ many more years of authentic and compassionate service. ____________________",package_114_252.csv,2773,2773,2845,"[congressional record volume 162, number 167 (tuesday, november 22, 2016)] [extensions of remarks] [pages e1523-e1524] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] honoring zion first church of god in christ ______ hon. barbara lee of california in the house of representatives tuesday, november 22, 2016 ms. lee. mr. speaker, i rise today to honor zion first church of god in christ located in oakland, california upon its 100th anniversary as a strong religious pillar in the east bay community. after moving to california from louisiana, zion first church of god in christ was founded in 1916 by samuel harrison and was the first church of god in christ in northern california. it was created with the vision to expand the ministry and establish a legacy of spirituality through faith. under the leadership of pastor harrison, the church thrived and soon needed a building to accommodate its growing membership. in 1921, the church purchased its first building purchase in west oakland and became a strong faith center for the west oakland community. during the 1940's, as african americans migrated to the west for industrial jobs, many families settled in west oakland. worship services immediately grew and were so inspirational it was said that people would hang out of their windows to see what was going on in the services. on january 25, 1977 pastor willie e. pearls was ushered in as the second leader of zion first church of god in christ. pastor pearls had moved to california. in 1978, zion first upgraded its building to make room for its growing membership. pastor pearls moved to california in 1952 and joined zion. first, serving for many years as a youth leader, deacon, and a special helper to overseer harrison before accepting the role as senior pastor. pastor pearls carried on the original vision of the church, helping the community, by giving away food, clothing the homeless, and serving hot breakfast every sunday to the community.

BARBARA LEE of california in the house of representatives Tuesday, November 22, 2016 Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary life of an outstanding member of the East Bay community, the Honorable William Byron Rumford. He was born in Courtland, Arizona in 1915. As a child, he shined shoes, sold newspapers, and graduated from George Washington Carver High School in Phoenix in 1926. After finishing his studies at Sacramento Junior College in 1931, he earned his pharmacy degree at the University of California, San Francisco. After he graduated, he took a number of exams for employment and was discriminated against at every turn. He fought his way through by appealing his oral examination, ultimately becoming a member of the California Board of Pharmacy. Mr. Rumford worked in the Bay Area as an assistant pharmacist and as a venereal disease investigator for the state. In 1942, he co-invested in a pharmacy on Sacramento Street in Berkeley, which he later purchased and renamed Rumford's Pharmacy (now known as the Rumford Clinic). Later, he served as the director of the Oakland chapter of the Red Cross, president of the East Bay Health Association, and was on the region's Democratic Central Committee. Mr. Rumford went on to lead an impactful and significant political career, and ultimately became the first African American legislator from Northern California. Inspired by the disparities he witnessed in his pharmaceutical career, he joined the Berkeley Emergency Housing Committee in 1942 and the Berkeley Rent Board in 1944. In addition, he worked with the unofficial Berkeley Interracial Committee which was intended to ease tensions between the Black community of Berkeley and White Southerners who were moving in. He was also a member of the Appomattox Club, which was one of the first African American political organizations in the country; there was little hope for an African American candidate at that time, so the organization supported White candidates who they believed were right on political issues affecting the African American community. Mr. Rumford did not seek to become a professional politician; instead, he was a neighborhood pharmacist who was passionate about addressing the biggest issues impacting his community. Eventually, Mr. Rumford ran for election in the California Assembly and won in 1949. At first he represented mostly African American areas of Oakland and a portion of South Berkeley. In 1960, however, the district was enlarged to include all of Berkeley and parts of Albany. As an Assembly Member, Mr. Rumford produced several effective pieces of legislation. In 1949, he worked tirelessly to pass the Bill to end discrimination in the National Guard. He also introduced legislation early in his Assembly tenure pertaining to fair trade, small businesses, child polio immunizations, atomic energy conversion, and environmental pollution. Today, Mr. Rumford is best remembered for three pieces of legislation: the California Fair Employment Practices Act of 1959, which lessened the impact of race on hiring decisions; the Good Samaritan Act of 1959, which garnered national attention as the first law in the country to protect professionals in emergency situations; and the law that bore his name: the Rumford Fair Housing Act of 1963, which failed to survive a referendum challenge, but was upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States. This act served as California's main enforcement authority against race-based housing discrimination, by way of housing covenants, until the passage of the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1968. His tremendous legacy paved the way for civil rights legislation nationally, and has been beautifully honored by the William Byron Rumford Memorial Project. This project is led by a diverse group of community members who see the rapid changing of South Berkeley's demographics as a ripe time to honor his leadership, activism, and community, while preserving the neighborhood's history. On a personal note, William was a trailblazer. Had it not been for him, I never would have been elected to the CA legislature. I owe him a debt of gratitude and I will be forever grateful. Today, California's 13th Congressional District salutes the legacy of the Honorable William Byron Rumford. His contributions have truly impacted countless lives through the East Bay area and the country. I join all of Mr. Rumford's loved ones and the community members involved in the William Byron Rumford Memorial Project in celebrating his incredible life and legacy. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 22, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1524] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING WILLIAM BYRON RUMFORD ______ HON.

JOSEPH CROWLEY of new york in the house of representatives Tuesday, November 22, 2016 Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the winner of the 2016 Veterans Day essay contest from New York's 14th Congressional District. George Rivera, a student from I.S. 61 in Corona, Queens submitted the winning essay on the topic, ``What Veterans Day Means To Me.'' George's essay reads as follows: Veteran's Day is a public holiday in the United States and it is celebrated on November 11th. On this day, we honor those who fought for our country and thank them for all they have done. The U.S. Armed Forces risk their lives every day for us. The Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, Marine Corps, and the Navy, all make up the United States Armed Forces. Taking time out of our day to honor them is the least that we can do compared to what they have done for us. This holiday is not only for those who served in our military, but also for the ones who are still serving today. Many people take for granted what they do for us; not only this, but some people even forget about them without realizing that without them, we probably would not have the freedom that we have today. These soldiers sacrifice so much for the people they don't even know; they leave their families to fight for our country. Many people enjoy their freedom without knowing that soldiers are dying behind the lines for them to keep their freedom and rights. All of the soldiers show love to our Nation through this big sacrifice. There are U.S. soldiers located all around the world and I know they miss their families but continue fighting for us. My brother is currently serving in the U.S. Army. Right now he is in Guam which is an island near Japan. I know he misses us but he still strives to keep people from taking our freedom. Throughout U.S. history, many soldiers have lost their lives. In World War I, nearly 11 million military soldiers died, and in World War II even more soldiers died to save our world from tyranny; they wanted to keep the United States safe. At least two soldiers, on average, die each day trying to fight for our country. Imagine, that is between 600 and 800 soldiers that die every single year, leaving their families with tears. It is really not that hard to honor these men and women; all you can do is take a little time out of your day to visit a Veteran's nursing home and thank all the veterans there. Families worry every single day and hope that their sister, brother, son, daughter, mother, or fathers are okay. On Veteran's Day, I honor my brother and all U.S. soldiers that are serving. My brother has made me grow as a person, many soldiers have to face struggles and sometimes they have to kill just to keep the rest of us safe. Would you kill someone to keep other people you don't know safe? Not everyone can be a soldier so we should thank and love the soldiers who keep us and our families safe. Without them, our lives would be completely different and probably more dangerous. Even the soldiers who are located in the United States on the borders should earn the same respect as the soldiers who fight in Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan. Every soldier has the same duty and mindset to keep danger away from the United States. That is what Veteran's Day means to me and I think all the soldiers who have served in the past and who are serving now deserve our respect and gratitude. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 22, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1524] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN HONOR OF GEORGE RIVERA AND HIS WINNING SUBMISSION TO THE 2016 VETERANS DAY ESSAY CONTEST FROM NEW YORK'S 14TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT ______ HON.

Today November 17th, 2016, ICA Fund Good [[Page E1525]] Jobs celebrates its many achievements in supporting small businesses and creating good jobs throughout the Bay Area. ICA Fund Good Jobs was founded in 1996 as Oakland Advisors (later Inner City Advisors). Its mission is to create jobs for people with high barriers to employment, by helping entrepreneurs with consulting, education, and investment services. ICA focuses on high-growth small businesses in order to create accessible jobs that provide living wages, health benefits, and opportunities for advancement. In 2013 ICA founded a partner organization called ``Fund Good Jobs'', which provides small businesses with capital investments and helps reduce the burden of relying on commercial lending for start-up businesses. In 2015 ICA and Fund Good Jobs combined their operations to become a comprehensive support structure for local businesses in the East Bay. In its 20-year history, ICA Fund Good Jobs has worked with more than 500 companies to create more than 5,000 jobs and generate over $65 million in local employee wealth. ICA Fund Good Jobs is a certified Community Development Financial Institution, and has used its expertise and capital to support successful startups including Revolution Foods, Blue Bottle Coffee, and newer successes such as Firebrand Artisan Breads and Back to the Roots. These companies and others supported by ICA Fund Good Jobs have spurred economic growth throughout the East Bay, and are examples of the fulfillment of ICA Fund Good Job's mission. On behalf of the residents of California's 13th Congressional District, I congratulate ICA Fund Good Jobs on 20 years of exemplary service as it continues to solve long-standing problems in new ways, and move the needle on some of the Bay Area's most challenging indicators of socioeconomic inequality. I wish ICA Fund Good Jobs well as it continues to work toward ensuring that every worker has access to a good job. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 22, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1524-E1525] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF INNER CITY ADVISORS FUND GOOD JOBS ______ HON.

ETHEL MAE MOLO ______ HON. BARBARA LEE of california in the house of representatives Tuesday, November 22, 2016 Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary life of Mrs. Ethel Mae Molo, who was affectionately known by family and friends as GG. Mrs. Molo was born on October 27, 1914 in Homer, Louisiana. After graduating from McDonogh Thirty Five High School she attended and graduated from Xavier University in New Orleans, Louisiana with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Social Work. After moving to California Ethel married Mr. Raymond Molo, she also had three beautiful children. Once in California she was given the opportunity to hold a position on the Kaiser shipyard as a Rosie the Riveter, helping to support the war efforts for World War II. She later continued her service at the Naval Air station working on aircrafts. After many years as a dispatcher, she retired from the Air Station. Following her retirement Ethel was very active throughout her community. She worked with political leaders Ronald Dellums, Willie Brown, and Don Peralta on projects in the Bay Area. On a national level she was an active member of the NAACP, for fifteen years she helped fundraise money for Fannie Lou Hamer and the voting rights act in Mississippi. As a strong woman of faith Mrs. Molo worshiped at the Presbyterian Women of Faith East Oakland Fellowship Circle and was the secretary of her church. All in all, Ethel was a woman of many colors. Her interests were diverse as were the many people she touched with her hard work and dedication to her community and those that were less fortunate than her. Traveling, sewing, reading and cooking big meals for her friends and family were among her many hobbies. She spent her golden years reading, comfortably eating her favorite cookies, spending time with her family and watching her game shows. She leaves to celebrate her life, her three loving children, Dovelyn Burbridge-Winbush, Gene Hennen, and Alfreda Gibson-Hampton. She also leaves six generations of grandchildren, great grandchildren, and great-great grandchildren along with her nieces and nephew. Today, California's 13th Congressional District salutes the legacy of Mrs. Ethel Mae Molo. Her contributions have truly impacted countless lives throughout the Bay Area. I join her loved ones in celebrating her incredible life and offer my most sincere condolences. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 22, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1525] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING MRS.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary life and invaluable service of Ms. Patricia Jones, who passed away August 5, 2016. Patricia Marie Jones was born on September 3, 1944 in Vallejo, California to Booker T. and Mildred Jones. At a young age the family relocated back to its homeland of Heidelberg, Mississippi where Patricia graduated from Southside High School at the top of her class. After her high school graduation Patricia moved back to the Bay Area and enrolled at Vallejo Junior college. Patricia earned her Associates Degree. Understanding the power of education, Patricia transferred to San Francisco State University where she would earn her Bachelor's Degree two years later in Journalism. She then enrolled at University of California, Berkeley and in 1973 earned her Master's Degree in City Planning. Patricia had a distinguished career in public service that included local, state and federal service. She served in the city of Richmond as the city planner, the assistant to the City Manager for External Affairs and Assistant Director of Housing Development. She also served as a Board member of the East Bay Community Foundation. Most recently Patricia served as Assistant Executive Director of the Association of Bay Area Governments, a regional planning agency representing nine cities in the Bay Area. Patricia was committed to excellence known for her work ethic, integrity, creativity and fierce determination. She excelled at everything she did. Patricia was also a world traveler and over the years had visited Africa, Asia, Europe, South America and Cuba. She lived a full life and inspired all those around her to do the same. But no matter her accomplishments, Patricia always put family first; she always made time for them no matter the time of day or size of the problem. She leaves to honor her memory, brothers Terry and Kenneth Jones, along with her many nieces and nephews. Today, California's 13th Congressional District remembers the extraordinary life of Ms. Patricia Jones. Her contributions have truly impacted countless lives throughout the Bay Area.

Mr. Speaker, today I rise with my colleague, Congressman DeSaulnier to honor the extraordinary career and invaluable service to our community from Mr. Michael Davenport. A native of Richmond, California, Michael attended Richmond public schools and graduated from Harry Ells High School, going on to study at Contra Costa College. Michael began his career at Ford Motor Company in Richmond, where he worked as a train car unloader and later as an electric forklift mechanic. He also tried his hand in numerous trades, but ultimately found his passion when he began working in the security industry. In 1996, Michael co-founded DP Security. The company initially operated out of his van, but he was able to grow and establish the company as a reputable business in the community. The company would eventually sign contracts with Richmond Sanitation, Chevron Richmond Refinery, Ford Assembly Building, and many others. Since its inception, DP Security has employed 180 individuals, the majority of which have been residents of Richmond. Furthermore, Michael has been a civic leader, and has dedicated his life to influencing Richmond's youth by his active involvement in Richmond Little League's baseball organization, Salesian Boy's and Girl's Club, and the Richmond Black Firefighters Youth Academy. He has also been a longtime participant in the Smart Cookie Factory, donating supplies and bicycles to elementary school students. He has also been a member of the Richmond Police Activities League board, a member of Richmond Main Street, an executive board member of the Richmond Chamber of Commerce, the president of the Kiwanis Club, and the president of the Black Men and Women political organization. On behalf of the residents of California's 11th and 13th Congressional Districts, I would like to congratulate Michael Davenport on a well-deserved retirement.","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 22, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1526] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING MR.

BARBARA LEE of california in the house of representatives Tuesday, November 22, 2016 Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 150th anniversary of the Pacific School of Religion. Founded in 1866, the Pacific School of Religion (formerly known as the Pacific Theological Seminary) was established to serve as [[Page E1526]] ``an institution of the people'' and ``a child of the churches'' by preparing spiritually-rooted leaders through rigorous scholarship, practical training, and immersive footwork. Firmly cemented in the history of social justice in the United States, the school served as a building block for ongoing service including pastoral ministry, non- profit and civic leadership, and public policy. In 1901, the school moved to its first Berkeley location near the University of California, Berkeley campus. By 1916, because of the school's new nondenominational status and the faculty's growing interest in the importance of the world's religions to the Christian faith, the name was changed to its current name: Pacific School of Religion. During World War II, former President Arthur C. McGiffert and his colleague John C. Bennett voiced concerns of community members against Japanese internment camps, including the imprisonment of several seminarians. After the war, President McGiffert went on to remedy war- torn communities in both Europe and Asia through the establishment of the Post-War Rehabilitation School at PSR which trained students to minister to these communities. Similarly, the school provided necessary leadership for other intuitions with similar goals to promote education and dialog in underrepresented communities. The school later formed the Graduate Theological Union, a daring experiment in ecumenical cooperation between Protestant and Catholic institutions. This development aimed to bridge Protestant and Catholic Studies and bring forth new fields of study in religion, such as LGBTQ and Gender Studies. Over the years, the Pacific School of Religion has gathered some of our nation's leading voices of social change and theological writers, including Georgia Harkness who later became the first tenured woman professor at the school in the 1950s. Today, graduates are well recognized in their respective fields and are a leading force in promoting social justice and compassion based-practices around the world. Their leadership and commitment to theology and religious studies have been critical starting points to cultivating positive change throughout our nation. On behalf of California's 13th Congressional District, I extend my sincerest congratulations to the Pacific School of Religion on this important milestone. Thank you to everyone who has contributed to its success over the years. I wish the faculty, students, and administration continued success in the years to come. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 22, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1525-E1526] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PACIFIC SCHOOL OF RELIGION ______ HON.
