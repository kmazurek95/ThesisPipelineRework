CHRISTOPHER P. GIBSON of new york in the house of representatives Friday, November 25, 2016 Mr. GIBSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Lao Heritage Flag as the Official Symbol of the Lao-American Community of New York and Wat Lao Samakhitham. The members of the Lao-American Community in New York are true patriots in every sense of the word. Before arriving in America, many Lao-Americans courageously fought and shed blood in their struggle for freedom during the Southeast Asian conflict in the 1960's and 1970's. As American citizens, they continue to embody an unwavering love of liberty and a desire to serve. There are a significant number of Lao- Americans in New York, and they make great contributions to their local communities. Lao-American citizens are proud to fly the Lao Heritage Flag alongside the flag of the United States of America. This flag is characterized by the three-headed white elephant, and it is significant to Lao-Americans as a symbol of resilience, freedom, and democracy in Laos, as well as the United States of America. Under this flag, the Lao-American community of New York maintains their Lao cultural heritage while simultaneously celebrating American heritage and customs. Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would like to acknowledge each member of the vibrant Lao-American community in New York and thank them for their valuable contribution to our State. As a former service member, I believe strongly in the great symbolism of a flag and the pride that accompanies its display. It is my hope that the Lao-American community will always look to the Lao Heritage Flag and be reminded of the prosperity and freedom for Lao-American citizens across the United States. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 168 (Friday, November 25, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1527] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE LAO HERITAGE FLAG AS THE OFFICIAL SYMBOL OF THE LAO- AMERICAN COMMUNITY OF NEW YORK AND WAT LAO SAMAKHITHAM ______ HON.
