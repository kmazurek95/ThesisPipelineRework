CREC-2016-11-28-pt1-PgS6505-9,CREC-2016-11-28,114,DISPUTE AT STANDING ROCK RESERVATION,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 169 (Monday, November 28, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6505-S6506] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DISPUTE AT STANDING ROCK RESERVATION Mr. REID. Madam President, this month is Native American Heritage Month. During this month, we honor the contributions of American Indians and also, of course, Alaskan Natives and Hawaiians. We don't have to look very far to see how Native Americans continue fighting for their heritage. They really must fight for their heritage. If you pick up a newspaper or turn to the news on any channel you want, you will see what is happening at the Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is opposing the construction of a portion of the Dakota Access Pipeline that passes near their reservation where it crosses the Missouri River. They are concerned that the construction of the pipeline could not only destroy ancestral burial grounds but could also contaminate the water supply for the tribe, as well as for millions of others who depend on water from the Missouri River. The Standing Rock Sioux are fighting for their land, the right to clean water, clean air, and their history. They are not alone. The Standing Rock Sioux have been joined by thousands of others, including members of hundreds of tribes throughout the United States. Last month, while I was in Nevada, members of the 27 Native American tribes we have in Nevada made it clear to me that they stand in solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux. But I do too. Here is why. Here is why I join with the Standing Rock Sioux in calling for an alternative route for the pipeline's construction. It is past time that this situation be resolved peacefully. It has lingered for months, and the debate has descended into violence. Private security guards have unleashed attack dogs on Indians, resulting in men, women, and children being bitten and some very severely. Police have used rubber bullets, tear gas, and compression grenades. Some 300 people have been treated for injuries as a result of this violence against the protesters. The most severe injury took place a week ago, when one young woman had parts of her arm and hand blown off. The violence at Standing Rock must end. I am confident that President Obama's administration is taking the necessary steps to address the situation. They have done well so far. What is happening at Standing Rock is a movement that has captured the attention of the entire country. But we should understand the context of what is taking place. We should be mindful that the history of this region is fraught with disputes--very few [[Page S6506]] of which, if any, have been resolved in the favor of the Indians. This region is fraught, I repeat, with disputes between Native Americans and the U.S. Government--disputes that originated more than a century ago but that, in the minds of the Indians, are still very much alive. Last week, Kevin Gover, the Director of the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian, which is a wonderful place, put the clash at Standing Rock in historic perspective. Here is what he said: Take Standing Rock, for example . . . if you know what the history of the Sioux Nation is, you know that the treaties were made with the Sioux Nation concerning these lands that no longer belong to the Sioux Nation. And you know that the development of the Missouri River for the past century has always, always involved taking of Indian land. They were building dams up and down the Missouri, and every Indian reservation along the way was flooded. Some of the best land was flooded, which only deepened their poverty and made it that much harder to climb out [of poverty, which they haven't]. So we should know that kind of history. I agree. This is the history to which he is referring--or at least a part of it. In the 1890s, Congress pushed the Sioux to reservations, took them off their ancestral lands, and jammed them into reservations. Speaking from the knowledge I have, what they did to the Panamint and Shoshone in Nevada is unbelievable. They put them in the worst places you could find. That is what they did to the Sioux. In the 1890s, they pushed the Sioux into reservations. Then, two decades later, in violation of all of the treaties they had, they built dams on the Missouri River that shrunk the size of the reservations even more. Then, in the 1940s, the United States built yet another dam, putting the Sioux's most fertile land underwater. I don't intend to have all of the answers. But I do know from experience that progress is possible when cooperation and respect form the foundation of fairness, especially on issues related to tribal rights and environmental concerns. I take one example that I know a lot about, and that is what happened in Nevada with a really large powerplant--coal-fired--called the Reid Gardner coal-fired plant. It was one of the dirtiest powerplants in the entire country. This coal plant was located less than a football field from the tribal reservation. Every day it dumped thousands of tons of toxins in the air, such as arsenic, mercury, and lead. Tribal members got sick. Of course, they did. Some 300 people on the reservation were poisoned daily by the pollution. But working with the Moapa Paiutes, I called for closure of the plant. People thought: Why are you doing this? It was the right thing to do. It was the right thing to do for the environment, but, more importantly, it was the fair and just thing to do for the Moapa Band of Paiutes. Since that time, when we started this initial effort, three of Reid Gardner's four generating units have been shut down--closed. The whole coal facility will be out of business within the next 90 days. That is pretty good. It is gone. Why? Because we had government. Local and State governments, Indian government, and the power company all worked together to address this issue. It could not have been done without all three of them working together. I have said this publicly. I have had a lot of disputes with the monopoly power company in Nevada, but on this issue I have complimented them because they did the right thing. With the Paiute tribe, instead of having this toxic dump in the form of a coal-fired generating plant right next to them that they breathe every day, they now have a huge solar farm. It has created lots of construction jobs. That electricity is now being sent to the city of Los Angeles. It has been good for everybody-- good for the air of Nevada, good for the Indians with work. It has helped the environment. The power company has made other arrangements for their power. They did it fairly easily. The simple truth is, based on this whole experience I had, that you need to work together, whether it is the Moapa Paiutes or the Standing Rock Sioux. They are exposed to more pollution than most Americans. That is the way it is. We don't talk a lot about the people who are severely impacted by a century of practically limitless pollution--Indians. This is not an urban or rural phenomenon. It is everywhere, and it is dangerous. Researchers at the University of Minnesota found that the difference in exposure to nitrogen dioxide alone is equal to roughly 7,000 deaths a year from heart disease. From South Dakota to Nevada, Native Americans are on the frontlines of these environmental and public health catastrophes. To make matters worse, heavy-polluting industries are fighting to return to the days of limitless pollution under the next administration. Can the people of America expect our newly elected President to intervene on their behalf against the big polluters? Can the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe depend on the man who is financially invested in the Dakota Access Pipeline? Probably not. This is about more than President-Elect Trump or fossil fuel profits. What is happening at Standing Rock is about respect for people: Where they build their homes, where they raise their families. The violence and aggression against the Standing Rock Sioux in North Dakota is a tragic example of the failure to respect people, of longstanding grievances, for how they and their natural resources have been treated. No one can see this more than the Indians. The Standing Rock Sioux protest at the Dakota Access Pipeline has everything to do with the history of broken promises and the institutionalized disregard for the rights of their own land as well as the trust relationship between Indian tribes and the Federal Government of the United States. While most stakeholders want a speedy end to this situation, we must understand that overreaction to protesters, violence, and disregard for our history undermines the likelihood of a mutually acceptable solution and rubs salt in already festering wounds. Profits should not be a determining factor of how this matter is resolved. The Obama administration has recognized that this history means the Dakota Access Pipeline is much more complicated than a water- crossing permit. They are doing the right thing by working with tribes to develop a better consultation process. I appreciate very much what the Obama administration has done. They recognize that history means that the pipeline is more complicated than simply a water crossing. I appreciate that the President is showing the Standing Rock Sioux the respect to which they are entitled. President Obama has less than 2 months left in his term, and it is becoming clear that the dispute at Standing Rock likely will not be resolved before he leaves office. I encourage the new administration and the Army Corps of Engineers to continue finding an alternate route. There is one out there. This should not be that hard. There is no reason this situation cannot be remedied in a manner that is fair to all. Three hundred people have already been injured. Grenades. Dogs being sicced on these Indians. Water being sprayed on them in freezing temperatures--below-freezing temperatures. Our Native-American tribes are looking to the Federal Government for help. For once, let's get them some help rather than just continue taking from them. They want to believe that after centuries of wrongs, the United States will finally get it right. Indians want to believe that after so long of being treated with no respect, the United States will help and not hurt. Relocating the pipeline to a more suitable area away from the Standing Rock Indian Reservation would be an easy and historic step in the right direction. For the sake of our country, I hope that happens. Madam President, I see no one on the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 169 (Monday, November 28, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6505-S6506] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DISPUTE AT STANDING ROCK RESERVATION Mr. REID.

Every day it dumped thousands of tons of toxins in the air, such as arsenic, mercury, and lead. Tribal members got sick. Of course, they did. Some 300 people on the reservation were poisoned daily by the pollution. But working with the Moapa Paiutes, I called for closure of the plant. People thought: Why are you doing this? It was the right thing to do. It was the right thing to do for the environment, but, more importantly, it was the fair and just thing to do for the Moapa Band of Paiutes. Since that time, when we started this initial effort, three of Reid Gardner's four generating units have been shut down--closed. The whole coal facility will be out of business within the next 90 days. That is pretty good. It is gone. Why? Because we had government. Local and State governments, Indian government, and the power company all worked together to address this issue. It could not have been done without all three of them working together. I have said this publicly. I have had a lot of disputes with the monopoly power company in Nevada, but on this issue I have complimented them because they did the right thing. With the Paiute tribe, instead of having this toxic dump in the form of a coal-fired generating plant right next to them that they breathe every day, they now have a huge solar farm. It has created lots of construction jobs. That electricity is now being sent to the city of Los Angeles. It has been good for everybody-- good for the air of Nevada, good for the Indians with work. It has helped the environment. The power company has made other arrangements for their power. They did it fairly easily. The simple truth is, based on this whole experience I had, that you need to work together, whether it is the Moapa Paiutes or the Standing Rock Sioux. They are exposed to more pollution than most Americans. That is the way it is. We don't talk a lot about the people who are severely impacted by a century of practically limitless pollution--Indians. This is not an urban or rural phenomenon. It is everywhere, and it is dangerous. Researchers at the University of Minnesota found that the difference in exposure to nitrogen dioxide alone is equal to roughly 7,000 deaths a year from heart disease. From South Dakota to Nevada, Native Americans are on the frontlines of these environmental and public health catastrophes. To make matters worse, heavy-polluting industries are fighting to return to the days of limitless pollution under the next administration. Can the people of America expect our newly elected President to intervene on their behalf against the big polluters? Can the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe depend on the man who is financially invested in the Dakota Access Pipeline? Probably not. This is about more than President-Elect Trump or fossil fuel profits. What is happening at Standing Rock is about respect for people: Where they build their homes, where they raise their families. The violence and aggression against the Standing Rock Sioux in North Dakota is a tragic example of the failure to respect people, of longstanding grievances, for how they and their natural resources have been treated. No one can see this more than the Indians. The Standing Rock Sioux protest at the Dakota Access Pipeline has everything to do with the history of broken promises and the institutionalized disregard for the rights of their own land as well as the trust relationship between Indian tribes and the Federal Government of the United States. While most stakeholders want a speedy end to this situation, we must understand that overreaction to protesters, violence, and disregard for our history undermines the likelihood of a mutually acceptable solution and rubs salt in already festering wounds. Profits should not be a determining factor of how this matter is resolved. The Obama administration has recognized that this history means the Dakota Access Pipeline is much more complicated than a water- crossing permit. They are doing the right thing by working with tribes to develop a better consultation process. I appreciate very much what the Obama administration has done. They recognize that history means that the pipeline is more complicated than simply a water crossing. I appreciate that the President is showing the Standing Rock Sioux the respect to which they are entitled. President Obama has less than 2 months left in his term, and it is becoming clear that the dispute at Standing Rock likely will not be resolved before he leaves office. I encourage the new administration and the Army Corps of Engineers to continue finding an alternate route. There is one out there. This should not be that hard. There is no reason this situation cannot be remedied in a manner that is fair to all. Three hundred people have already been injured. Grenades. Dogs being sicced on these Indians. Water being sprayed on them in freezing temperatures--below-freezing temperatures. Our Native-American tribes are looking to the Federal Government for help. For once, let's get them some help rather than just continue taking from them. They want to believe that after centuries of wrongs, the United States will finally get it right. Indians want to believe that after so long of being treated with no respect, the United States will help and not hurt. Relocating the pipeline to a more suitable area away from the Standing Rock Indian Reservation would be an easy and historic step in the right direction. For the sake of our country, I hope that happens. Madam President, I see no one on the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 169 (Monday, November 28, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 169 (Monday, November 28, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6505-S6506] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DISPUTE AT STANDING ROCK RESERVATION Mr. REID. Madam President, this month is Native American Heritage Month. During this month, we honor the contributions of American Indians and also, of course, Alaskan Natives and Hawaiians. We don't have to look very far to see how Native Americans continue fighting for their heritage. They really must fight for their heritage. If you pick up a newspaper or turn to the news on any channel you want, you will see what is happening at the Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is opposing the construction of a portion of the Dakota Access Pipeline that passes near their reservation where it crosses the Missouri River. They are concerned that the construction of the pipeline could not only destroy ancestral burial grounds but could also contaminate the water supply for the tribe, as well as for millions of others who depend on water from the Missouri River. The Standing Rock Sioux are fighting for their land, the right to clean water, clean air, and their history. They are not alone. The Standing Rock Sioux have been joined by thousands of others, including members of hundreds of tribes throughout the United States. Last month, while I was in Nevada, members of the 27 Native American tribes we have in Nevada made it clear to me that they stand in solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux. But I do too. Here is why. Here is why I join with the Standing Rock Sioux in calling for an alternative route for the pipeline's construction. It is past time that this situation be resolved peacefully. It has lingered for months, and the debate has descended into violence. Private security guards have unleashed attack dogs on Indians, resulting in men, women, and children being bitten and some very severely. Police have used rubber bullets, tear gas, and compression grenades. Some 300 people have been treated for injuries as a result of this violence against the protesters. The most severe injury took place a week ago, when one young woman had parts of her arm and hand blown off. The violence at Standing Rock must end. I am confident that President Obama's administration is taking the necessary steps to address the situation. They have done well so far. What is happening at Standing Rock is a movement that has captured the attention of the entire country. But we should understand the context of what is taking place. We should be mindful that the history of this region is fraught with disputes--very few [[Page S6506]] of which, if any, have been resolved in the favor of the Indians. This region is fraught, I repeat, with disputes between Native Americans and the U.S. Government--disputes that originated more than a century ago but that, in the minds of the Indians, are still very much alive. Last week, Kevin Gover, the Director of the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian, which is a wonderful place, put the clash at Standing Rock in historic perspective. Here is what he said: Take Standing Rock, for example . . . if you know what the history of the Sioux Nation is, you know that the treaties were made with the Sioux Nation concerning these lands that no longer belong to the Sioux Nation. And you know that the development of the Missouri River for the past century has always, always involved taking of Indian land. They were building dams up and down the Missouri, and every Indian reservation along the way was flooded. Some of the best land was flooded, which only deepened their poverty and made it that much harder to climb out [of poverty, which they haven't]. So we should know that kind of history. I agree. This is the history to which he is referring--or at least a part of it. In the 1890s, Congress pushed the Sioux to reservations, took them off their ancestral lands, and jammed them into reservations. Speaking from the knowledge I have, what they did to the Panamint and Shoshone in Nevada is unbelievable. They put them in the worst places you could find. That is what they did to the Sioux. In the 1890s, they pushed the Sioux into reservations. Then, two decades later, in violation of all of the treaties they had, they built dams on the Missouri River that shrunk the size of the reservations even more. Then, in the 1940s, the United States built yet another dam, putting the Sioux's most fertile land underwater. I don't intend to have all of the answers. But I do know from experience that progress is possible when cooperation and respect form the foundation of fairness, especially on issues related to tribal rights and environmental concerns. I take one example that I know a lot about, and that is what happened in Nevada with a really large powerplant--coal-fired--called the Reid Gardner coal-fired plant. It was one of the dirtiest powerplants in the entire country. This coal plant was located less than a football field from the tribal reservation.

Madam President, over the next few weeks, Senators will work to conclude the business of the 114th Congress as we begin looking forward to the 115th. We have a lot to do, including approving several conference reports and funding the government. It is good to see the respective committees making important progress on conference reports for the National Defense Authorization Act and the Water Resources Development Act. We will work with our counterparts in the House to consider each of those in the coming days and to send final bills to the President's desk for signature. We will also take up the 21st-century cures bill, which contains resources to promote medical research, including advancing regenerative medicine, among many other important provisions. Sometime soon we will also take up the Iran Sanctions Extension Act, which provides underlying authorities necessary to reimpose sanctions if those sanctions are called for on the country that has continued to exhibit disturbing and very aggressive behavior. And of course we will work to pass the continuing resolution to fund the government. I would also like to note that my friend from Alaska, Senator Murkowski, is continuing her efforts to advance the Energy Policy Modernization Act, which passed the Senate with large bipartisan support earlier this year. As the chair of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, she has been a champion of this critical bill and has never stopped working to move it forward.

CREC-2016-11-28-pt1-PgS6510,CREC-2016-11-28,114,COMMENTS OF THE SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 169 (Monday, November 28, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S6510] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMMENTS OF THE SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I confess that I came to the floor to talk about some of the nominations that we are going to see coming from the administration, particularly regarding one of our colleagues, Senator Sessions, the Senator from Alabama, to be the next Attorney General. I am somewhat taken aback by the nature of the comments that I hear coming from the Senator from Massachusetts. I had to refresh my memory of the Senate Standing Rules, which I thought prohibited this sort of ad hominem attack--the claims of corruption, selling legislation for campaign contributions. I thought the rules of decorum of the Senate prohibited that sort of demagoguery. But I am not sure you can write a rule that would prohibit somebody who is actually determined to defy the very voters they claim to be representing. If our Democratic colleagues like the result of the election that just occurred on November 8, I would say: Keep on keeping on. Keep on with this same sort of ad hominem attacks and attacking the motivation of people, rather than talking about policy. I thought that is what the Senate was supposed to be all about--not where we come in here and call each other names. It is no wonder that the American people are turned off by what they see as politics as usual. I think what they told us on November 8 is that they actually would like to see us accomplish some things--first of all, starting with listening to them, not telling them what is good for them and saying: Well, if you don't like it, you are going to have to take it because the people in power, the people working in Washington, the elites in America know better than you do what is good for you. So when I hear the Senator from Massachusetts come in and give essentially a political speech, such as she did, not talking about the merits or the policy but rather making personal attacks against Senators and people who support the policy, I just think this is beneath the dignity of the Senate. I would hope we would rise to the occasion, in the wake of this historic election and say: You know what, we can do better. The American people deserve better than what they have been getting coming out of Washington. The only way we are going to be able to turn this country around is by, first of all, listening to what the American people are telling us. We know what they said is this: We are not happy with the direction of the country, and we are not happy with what is happening in Washington. To come in and make the kind of speeches that I just heard a moment ago is disturbing. It is disappointing. We can do better than that. We must do better than that if we are going to regain the confidence of the American people that we are actually worthy of their support as we try to guide this ship of state and try to pass laws that actually will improve the quality of their lives by growing the economy, by making it possible for people to find work who want work so they can provide for their families, to try to make sure that the American people are safe and secure, and to provide for our common defense. Those are the sorts of things we ought to be focused on. So it is a little distressing to walk into this Chamber, in what used to be known as the world's greatest deliberative body, and to hear the sort of diatribe and the personal attacks and the name calling that we just heard from the Senator from Massachusetts. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 169 (Monday, November 28, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S6510] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMMENTS OF THE SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS Mr. CORNYN.

Madam President, during the Presidential campaign, which just concluded, President-Elect Donald Trump made some inflammatory remarks about immigration and immigrants. I condemned those remarks, as did many in both political parties, and I remain concerned about the impact that rhetoric has on America and the people who are living in the United States. On election night, Mr. Trump said, ``Now it is time for America to bind the wounds of division.'' As one step in bringing our Nation together, Mr. Trump should change his thinking on at least one aspect of immigration, and I hope even more. As the President-elect knows, we are, in fact, a nation of immigrants, and immigration makes America stronger. Like me, Mr. Trump is the son of an immigrant. His wife will be only the second immigrant in American history to serve as First Lady. During a recent interview, Mr. Trump acknowledged that millions of undocumented immigrants are ``terrific people.'' That is a good start; words matter. The tone the President-elect sets with the language he uses can help to bind the divisions in America, but actions matter as well. I hope that one of President-Elect Trump's first actions will be to pledge to continue the program known as DACA. It was 6 years ago that I sent a letter to President Barack Obama, and joining me in that letter was Senator Dick Lugar, a Republican Senator from Indiana. It was a bipartisan letter, and we asked President Obama to stop the deportations of young immigrants who grew up in this country. These young people have come to be known as DREAMers. They were brought to the United States as children. They grew up singing the national anthem in their classrooms and pledging allegiance to the only flag they ever knew--the American flag. These DREAMers are casualties of our broken immigration system. They were brought here as children, toddlers, infants, babies. They didn't have any voice in the decision of their family to come to America. They were brought here to live. We invested in them. We put them in our school systems. It really makes no sense, since many of them have become accomplished and promising young people, to give up on them now and deport them back to countries they have never known. The President of the United States, Barack Obama, responded. He established the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which is known as DACA. DACA provides temporary renewable legal status to immigrant students who arrived in the United States as children. What does it take? A student has to fill out an application form. When this Executive action went into effect, I joined with Congressman Luis Gutierrez of Chicago. We decided on the first day of eligibility we would set up some tables at the Navy Pier in Chicago, and we would welcome young people to come in and sign up. These were undocumented young people who had grown up in the United States, and now they had a chance because of the President's Executive action to ask for temporary protected status and a work permit. It cost money, almost $500. When they submitted their names, they also submitted their names for a criminal background check to make certain they had no serious criminal offense and they were no threat to this country. Congressman Gutierrez and I expected several hundred to show up. We had immigration lawyers ready to volunteer to help them fill out the forms. We were stunned. The night before, at midnight, they started lining up in the dark with their parents, and they waited all night to come into that room and to sign those applications so that they, as undocumented young people in America, would have a fighting chance to become part of America's future. That is all they asked for. They didn't ask for jobs. They didn't ask for government programs. They don't qualify for very many, if any. All they asked for was a chance--a chance to live here and not be deported and a chance to work here. So far, in the few years that DACA has been in effect, over 740,000 young people have signed up. They came forward, paid their fees, and went through the background checks. They were approved. Now they are working or going to school. DACA has allowed these DREAMers to make contributions to America that are valuable to all of us. They are soldiers, nurses, teachers, engineers, police officers, and they are aspiring to the highest levels of education in our country. These DACA recipients are making important contributions to our economy. A new study by the Center for American Progress finds that ending DACA would cost the United States $433.4 billion in gross domestic product over the next 10 years. These are not just bright young students; they are great workers. They will be great professionals. They will help people, and they will make America stronger. DACA is based on the DREAM Act. The DREAM Act is bipartisan legislation that I first introduced 15 years ago. If you are going to serve in the Senate, you have to be patient. I didn't dream I would be standing here 15 years later, still asking for the Senate to approve the DREAM Act. In the meantime, what President Obama did was to say we will protect these young people while Congress debates the future of immigration reform, but we will make sure that they can stay in this country without fear of deportation. If the DREAM Act is enacted into law--and, incidentally, it passed the Senate several years ago--it will give these undocumented students a chance to earn their way to legal status and citizenship. DACA is clearly legal. Like every President before him, President Obama has the authority to set immigration policy for his administration. DACA is also smart and realistic. It is a way to enforce our immigration laws the right way, to make sure that these young people who have done nothing wrong, who have no criminal problems, who have paid their fee and registered with the government are allowed to [[Page S6508]] stay without fear of a knock on the door. The Department of Homeland Security has only enough funding to deport a small fraction of the undocumented immigrants in our country each year. President Obama has said he wants to focus those resources on those who should not be in the United States, those who could do us harm. That is just common sense. At the same time, the President said we shouldn't waste our resources on deporting young immigrant students who grew up in the United States and are making contributions to our future. During the campaign, President-Elect Trump pledged to rescind and end DACA. I believe that after his administration studies the issue, there is a chance he will reconsider when he comes to know these ``terrific people.'' I have come to the floor of the Senate now for over 10 years, telling the stories of these DREAMers. There was a time when they were afraid to come out publicly and tell America who they were. They had been warned by their parents since they were little kids to be careful. If you talk to the wrong person, if you do the wrong thing, if the police knock on the door, you may be deported along with the rest of your family, so be careful. As kids will, these young people across America have decided they are not going to hide who they are. They want to tell America their story, and I have tried to help them. When they have sent us their biographies, along with photographs, I have come to the floor on about a hundred different occasions to tell the stories of these DREAMers. Each one, in my estimation, is more amazing than the next, and today is no exception. This is Rey Pineda. In 1990, when Rey was 2 years old, his family came to the United States from Mexico. Rey grew up in Atlanta, GA. He worked hard and was an honor roll student in high school. He became the first member of his family to attend college. In 2010, he graduated with a major in philosophy from Southern Catholic College in Dawsonville, GA. Rey is a devout Catholic, and he decided to attend Mundelein Seminary in my home State of Illinois. Rey felt that God was calling him to be a priest, but his spiritual path was blocked. Rey is undocumented. Rey is a DREAMer. Then, in 2012, everything changed. President Obama's Executive action established DACA. In March of 2013, Rey was approved, filed his fee, went through the background check, and did everything he was asked to do. He received his DACA status, and he knew that at least for 2 years he would not be subject to deportation. That allowed him to become a deacon in the Catholic Church 2 months later, in May of 2013. In 2014, Rey entered the priesthood after he graduated magna cum laude from Mundelein Seminary in Illinois. He has a master of divinity degree. Today, Father Rey Pineda is a priest at the Cathedral of Christ the King in Atlanta, GA. He wrote me a letter, and here is what he said about DACA: Like many Dreamers, the U.S. is really the only country I know. DACA was an answer to many years of prayers. Without DACA I would not have been able to serve as a priest in my community. I believe my faith in God has brought me to this point in my life; but my faith in America's promise has pushed me to keep fighting for peace, justice, and opportunity in this great country I proudly call home. If DACA is eliminated--and that threat has been made--Father Rey Pineda will lose his legal status and be subject to deportation, being sent back to a country that he hasn't lived in since he was 2 years old. That would be a tragedy for Father Rey Pineda and his congregation and the hundreds of people who count on him as their priest. Consider this: There is a chronic shortage of Catholic priests in America. Since 1975, the number of priests has declined by 33 percent while the number of American Catholics has grown by 43 percent. Hundreds of parishes have been forced to close or consolidate. Nearly one out of five Catholic parishes in America have no priest. This shortage of priests is not limited to the Catholic Church. The problem is so serious that Congress has established a religious worker visa to allow people from overseas to come in on a visa and serve as priests in communities. It is happening all across my State of Illinois, and I bet it is happening in Iowa. If you go to parishes in rural areas, there will be priests from all over the world. I recently met one in Rome who was in Southern Illinois at Pinckneyville, and he was from Nigeria. At a time when the United States is actively importing ministers and priests from foreign countries, why do we want to deport Father Rey Pineda? This makes no sense. Listen to what Father Rey told me about his role as a priest who is an undocumented immigrant: I believe my entire journey has prepared me to be compassionate with the sufferings of many people I encounter. I look at my ministry as a calling to build bridges between people from all walks of life. Diversity sometimes brings challenges between people and I want to help heal those differences. After the most divisive election in recent memory, I believe that Father Rey Pineda and other DREAMers like him have an important role to play in healing the differences that divide America. I am hoping that President-Elect Trump will see this and will continue the DACA program. Let me be clear. If there is an attempt to shut down DACA, I will do everything in my power as a U.S. Senator to protect the DREAMers who have stepped forward and contributed their talents to our great country. Many of those DREAMers and their parents spoke to me that day at Navy Pier and ever since. They said: Senator, are you sure? Are you sure that we should sign up with this government? We have spent a lifetime trying to stay out of trouble, stay out of the view of people, not cause any problems, go about our business, raise our families, do our jobs, go to our church. If our children register with this government, will that come back at a future time and be used against us? At the time, I said--and I believe it now--that America would stand behind these young people. We will not allow them to be deported after what they have been through. We will not tell them that by complying with the requirements of our government, you have penalized yourself in the future. We want to give them a chance. Now is the time for America, this Nation of immigrants, to heal the wounds that divided us during this election. Let's start with the DREAMers, let's start with DACA, let's start with the young people who will make America better and stronger in the years to come. They are the best in this country. Let's make them the best for America's future. I hope and pray the President- elect's words and actions in the coming weeks and months will, in fact, bring us together. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. WARREN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 169 (Monday, November 28, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6507-S6508] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DACA Mr. DURBIN.

When they submitted their names, they also submitted their names for a criminal background check to make certain they had no serious criminal offense and they were no threat to this country. Congressman Gutierrez and I expected several hundred to show up. We had immigration lawyers ready to volunteer to help them fill out the forms. We were stunned. The night before, at midnight, they started lining up in the dark with their parents, and they waited all night to come into that room and to sign those applications so that they, as undocumented young people in America, would have a fighting chance to become part of America's future. That is all they asked for. They didn't ask for jobs. They didn't ask for government programs. They don't qualify for very many, if any. All they asked for was a chance--a chance to live here and not be deported and a chance to work here. So far, in the few years that DACA has been in effect, over 740,000 young people have signed up. They came forward, paid their fees, and went through the background checks. They were approved. Now they are working or going to school. DACA has allowed these DREAMers to make contributions to America that are valuable to all of us. They are soldiers, nurses, teachers, engineers, police officers, and they are aspiring to the highest levels of education in our country. These DACA recipients are making important contributions to our economy. A new study by the Center for American Progress finds that ending DACA would cost the United States $433.4 billion in gross domestic product over the next 10 years. These are not just bright young students; they are great workers. They will be great professionals. They will help people, and they will make America stronger. DACA is based on the DREAM Act. The DREAM Act is bipartisan legislation that I first introduced 15 years ago. If you are going to serve in the Senate, you have to be patient. I didn't dream I would be standing here 15 years later, still asking for the Senate to approve the DREAM Act. In the meantime, what President Obama did was to say we will protect these young people while Congress debates the future of immigration reform, but we will make sure that they can stay in this country without fear of deportation. If the DREAM Act is enacted into law--and, incidentally, it passed the Senate several years ago--it will give these undocumented students a chance to earn their way to legal status and citizenship. DACA is clearly legal. Like every President before him, President Obama has the authority to set immigration policy for his administration. DACA is also smart and realistic. It is a way to enforce our immigration laws the right way, to make sure that these young people who have done nothing wrong, who have no criminal problems, who have paid their fee and registered with the government are allowed to [[Page S6508]] stay without fear of a knock on the door. The Department of Homeland Security has only enough funding to deport a small fraction of the undocumented immigrants in our country each year. President Obama has said he wants to focus those resources on those who should not be in the United States, those who could do us harm. That is just common sense. At the same time, the President said we shouldn't waste our resources on deporting young immigrant students who grew up in the United States and are making contributions to our future. During the campaign, President-Elect Trump pledged to rescind and end DACA. I believe that after his administration studies the issue, there is a chance he will reconsider when he comes to know these ``terrific people.'' I have come to the floor of the Senate now for over 10 years, telling the stories of these DREAMers. There was a time when they were afraid to come out publicly and tell America who they were. They had been warned by their parents since they were little kids to be careful. If you talk to the wrong person, if you do the wrong thing, if the police knock on the door, you may be deported along with the rest of your family, so be careful. As kids will, these young people across America have decided they are not going to hide who they are. They want to tell America their story, and I have tried to help them. When they have sent us their biographies, along with photographs, I have come to the floor on about a hundred different occasions to tell the stories of these DREAMers. Each one, in my estimation, is more amazing than the next, and today is no exception. This is Rey Pineda. In 1990, when Rey was 2 years old, his family came to the United States from Mexico. Rey grew up in Atlanta, GA. He worked hard and was an honor roll student in high school. He became the first member of his family to attend college. In 2010, he graduated with a major in philosophy from Southern Catholic College in Dawsonville, GA. Rey is a devout Catholic, and he decided to attend Mundelein Seminary in my home State of Illinois. Rey felt that God was calling him to be a priest, but his spiritual path was blocked. Rey is undocumented. Rey is a DREAMer. Then, in 2012, everything changed. President Obama's Executive action established DACA. In March of 2013, Rey was approved, filed his fee, went through the background check, and did everything he was asked to do. He received his DACA status, and he knew that at least for 2 years he would not be subject to deportation. That allowed him to become a deacon in the Catholic Church 2 months later, in May of 2013. In 2014, Rey entered the priesthood after he graduated magna cum laude from Mundelein Seminary in Illinois. He has a master of divinity degree. Today, Father Rey Pineda is a priest at the Cathedral of Christ the King in Atlanta, GA. He wrote me a letter, and here is what he said about DACA: Like many Dreamers, the U.S. is really the only country I know. DACA was an answer to many years of prayers. Without DACA I would not have been able to serve as a priest in my community. I believe my faith in God has brought me to this point in my life; but my faith in America's promise has pushed me to keep fighting for peace, justice, and opportunity in this great country I proudly call home. If DACA is eliminated--and that threat has been made--Father Rey Pineda will lose his legal status and be subject to deportation, being sent back to a country that he hasn't lived in since he was 2 years old. That would be a tragedy for Father Rey Pineda and his congregation and the hundreds of people who count on him as their priest. Consider this: There is a chronic shortage of Catholic priests in America. Since 1975, the number of priests has declined by 33 percent while the number of American Catholics has grown by 43 percent. Hundreds of parishes have been forced to close or consolidate. Nearly one out of five Catholic parishes in America have no priest. This shortage of priests is not limited to the Catholic Church. The problem is so serious that Congress has established a religious worker visa to allow people from overseas to come in on a visa and serve as priests in communities. It is happening all across my State of Illinois, and I bet it is happening in Iowa. If you go to parishes in rural areas, there will be priests from all over the world. I recently met one in Rome who was in Southern Illinois at Pinckneyville, and he was from Nigeria. At a time when the United States is actively importing ministers and priests from foreign countries, why do we want to deport Father Rey Pineda? This makes no sense. Listen to what Father Rey told me about his role as a priest who is an undocumented immigrant: I believe my entire journey has prepared me to be compassionate with the sufferings of many people I encounter. I look at my ministry as a calling to build bridges between people from all walks of life. Diversity sometimes brings challenges between people and I want to help heal those differences. After the most divisive election in recent memory, I believe that Father Rey Pineda and other DREAMers like him have an important role to play in healing the differences that divide America. I am hoping that President-Elect Trump will see this and will continue the DACA program. Let me be clear. If there is an attempt to shut down DACA, I will do everything in my power as a U.S. Senator to protect the DREAMers who have stepped forward and contributed their talents to our great country. Many of those DREAMers and their parents spoke to me that day at Navy Pier and ever since. They said: Senator, are you sure? Are you sure that we should sign up with this government? We have spent a lifetime trying to stay out of trouble, stay out of the view of people, not cause any problems, go about our business, raise our families, do our jobs, go to our church. If our children register with this government, will that come back at a future time and be used against us? At the time, I said--and I believe it now--that America would stand behind these young people. We will not allow them to be deported after what they have been through. We will not tell them that by complying with the requirements of our government, you have penalized yourself in the future. We want to give them a chance. Now is the time for America, this Nation of immigrants, to heal the wounds that divided us during this election. Let's start with the DREAMers, let's start with DACA, let's start with the young people who will make America better and stronger in the years to come. They are the best in this country. Let's make them the best for America's future. I hope and pray the President- elect's words and actions in the coming weeks and months will, in fact, bring us together. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. WARREN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 169 (Monday, November 28, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 169 (Monday, November 28, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6507-S6508] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DACA Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, during the Presidential campaign, which just concluded, President-Elect Donald Trump made some inflammatory remarks about immigration and immigrants. I condemned those remarks, as did many in both political parties, and I remain concerned about the impact that rhetoric has on America and the people who are living in the United States. On election night, Mr. Trump said, ``Now it is time for America to bind the wounds of division.'' As one step in bringing our Nation together, Mr. Trump should change his thinking on at least one aspect of immigration, and I hope even more. As the President-elect knows, we are, in fact, a nation of immigrants, and immigration makes America stronger. Like me, Mr. Trump is the son of an immigrant. His wife will be only the second immigrant in American history to serve as First Lady. During a recent interview, Mr. Trump acknowledged that millions of undocumented immigrants are ``terrific people.'' That is a good start; words matter. The tone the President-elect sets with the language he uses can help to bind the divisions in America, but actions matter as well. I hope that one of President-Elect Trump's first actions will be to pledge to continue the program known as DACA. It was 6 years ago that I sent a letter to President Barack Obama, and joining me in that letter was Senator Dick Lugar, a Republican Senator from Indiana. It was a bipartisan letter, and we asked President Obama to stop the deportations of young immigrants who grew up in this country. These young people have come to be known as DREAMers. They were brought to the United States as children. They grew up singing the national anthem in their classrooms and pledging allegiance to the only flag they ever knew--the American flag. These DREAMers are casualties of our broken immigration system. They were brought here as children, toddlers, infants, babies. They didn't have any voice in the decision of their family to come to America. They were brought here to live. We invested in them. We put them in our school systems. It really makes no sense, since many of them have become accomplished and promising young people, to give up on them now and deport them back to countries they have never known. The President of the United States, Barack Obama, responded. He established the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which is known as DACA. DACA provides temporary renewable legal status to immigrant students who arrived in the United States as children. What does it take? A student has to fill out an application form. When this Executive action went into effect, I joined with Congressman Luis Gutierrez of Chicago. We decided on the first day of eligibility we would set up some tables at the Navy Pier in Chicago, and we would welcome young people to come in and sign up. These were undocumented young people who had grown up in the United States, and now they had a chance because of the President's Executive action to ask for temporary protected status and a work permit. It cost money, almost $500. When they submitted their names, they also submitted their names for a criminal background check to make certain they had no serious criminal offense and they were no threat to this country.

but my faith in america's promise has pushed me to keep fighting for peace, justice, and opportunity in this great country i proudly call home. if daca is eliminated--and that threat has been made--father rey pineda will lose his legal status and be subject to deportation, being sent back to a country that he hasn't lived in since he was 2 years old. that would be a tragedy for father rey pineda and his congregation and the hundreds of people who count on him as their priest. consider this: there is a chronic shortage of catholic priests in america. since 1975, the number of priests has declined by 33 percent while the number of american catholics has grown by 43 percent. hundreds of parishes have been forced to close or consolidate. nearly one out of five catholic parishes in america have no priest. this shortage of priests is not limited to the catholic church. the problem is so serious that congress has established a religious worker visa to allow people from overseas to come in on a visa and serve as priests in communities. it is happening all across my state of illinois, and i bet it is happening in iowa. if you go to parishes in rural areas, there will be priests from all over the world. i recently met one in rome who was in southern illinois at pinckneyville, and he was from nigeria. at a time when the united states is actively importing ministers and priests from foreign countries, why do we want to deport father rey pineda? this makes no sense. listen to what father rey told me about his role as a priest who is an undocumented immigrant: i believe my entire journey has prepared me to be compassionate with the sufferings of many people i encounter. i look at my ministry as a calling to build bridges between people from all walks of life. diversity sometimes brings challenges between people and i want to help heal those differences. after the most divisive election in recent memory, i believe that father rey pineda and other dreamers like him have an important role to play in healing the differences that divide america. i am hoping that president-elect trump will see this and will continue the daca program. let me be clear. if there is an attempt to shut down daca, i will do everything in my power as a u.s. senator to protect the dreamers who have stepped forward and contributed their talents to our great country. many of those dreamers and their parents spoke to me that day at navy pier and ever since. they said: senator, are you sure? are you sure that we should sign up with this government? we have spent a lifetime trying to stay out of trouble, stay out of the view of people, not cause any problems, go about our business, raise our families, do our jobs, go to our church. if our children register with this government, will that come back at a future time and be used against us? at the time, i said--and i believe it now--that america would stand behind these young people. we will not allow them to be deported after what they have been through. we will not tell them that by complying with the requirements of our government, you have penalized yourself in the future. we want to give them a chance. now is the time for america, this nation of immigrants, to heal the wounds that divided us during this election. let's start with the dreamers, let's start with daca, let's start with the young people who will make america better and stronger in the years to come. they are the best in this country. let's make them the best for america's future. i hope and pray the president- elect's words and actions in the coming weeks and months will, in fact, bring us together. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. ms. warren. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",13270
CREC-2016-11-28-pt1-PgS6508,CREC-2016-11-28,114,21ST CENTURY CURES BILL,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 169 (Monday, November 28, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6508-S6510] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] 21ST CENTURY CURES BILL Ms. WARREN. Madam President, 3 weeks ago Americans went to the polls. Voters were deeply divided on whether Democrats or Republicans should be in charge. Donald Trump is the President-elect, missing the popular vote by more than 2 million people. But there is one thing Americans are not divided on, one issue on which they sent out a message loud and clear. According to exit polls, 70 percent of voters said that they think the American economy and the lawmakers who oversee it are owned-- owned--by big companies and special interests. That is 70 percent of everyone--Republicans, Democrats, and Independents. In the closing days of this Congress, Big Pharma has its hand out for a bunch of special giveaways and favors that are packed together in something called the 21st Century Cures bill. It is on track to get a vote in the House this week and then get rammed through the Senate. I have been taking a look at the details, and when the American voters say that Congress is owned by big companies, this bill is exactly what they are talking about. Now we face a choice: Will this Congress say ``Yes, we are bought and paid for'' or will we stand up and work for the American people? [[Page S6509]] For more than 2 years, Congress has been working on legislation to help advance medical innovation in the United States. Medical innovation is powerfully important, and I have spent as much time working on this issue as anything I have worked on since I joined the U.S. Senate. From the beginning, I have emphasized one obvious fact: Medical breakthroughs come from increasing investments in basic research. Right now, Congress is choking off investments in the NIH. Adjusted for inflation, Federal spending on medical research over the past dozen years has been cut by 20 percent. Those cuts take the legs out from under future medical innovations in America. We can name a piece of legislation the ``Cures'' bill, but if it doesn't include significant, meaningful funding for the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration, it won't cure anything. That is why months ago Senate Democrats said any so- called Cures legislation must have significant investment in medical research, and that is why Senate Republicans publicly committed to do exactly that. But now they have reneged on their promise and let Big Pharma hijack the Cures bill. This final deal has only a tiny fig leaf of funding for NIH and for the opioid crisis, and most of that fig leaf isn't even real. Most of the money won't be there unless future Congresses pass future bills in future years to fund those dollars. So why bother with a fig leaf in the Cures bill? Why pretend to give money to NIH or opioids? This funding is political cover for huge giveaways to giant drug companies. There are more examples than I can count in this bill. But I am going to talk about three. First giveaway: Legalize fraud. You know, it is against the law for drug companies to market drugs for uses not approved by the FDA. Now, some drug companies find this rule annoying. After all, they can make a lot more money selling a headache pill as a cure for everything from hair loss to cancer. But pushing treatments without scientific evidence that they work is fraud--fraud that can hurt people. It also undercuts the development of real cures. That is why some of the largest law enforcement actions against big drug companies over the past 15 years have involved off-label marketing. Drug companies have paid billions of dollars in penalties. Now, one solution would be for those companies to follow the law. But they prefer plan B: Cozy up to enough people in Congress to pass this Cures bill that would shoot holes in the anti-fraud law. In other words, make it easier for drug companies to get away with fraud. Second giveaway: Cover up bribery. Right now the law requires drug companies to disclose the buckets of money they shower on doctors and hospitals to encourage them to prescribe certain drugs. It is, by the way, all published on a government Web site. You can go look up your doctor and your hospital right now online, if you want to do that. Now, the drug companies could have responded by ending kickbacks to doctors. But instead, they have chosen plan B again: Cozy up to enough people in Congress to pass this Cures bill, which would let drug companies keep secret any splashy junkets or gifts associated with so- called medical education and make it harder for enforcement agencies to be able to trace those bribes. Senator Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, says he is outraged by this provision. I have to say that I am with Senator Grassley on this one. Third giveaway: Hand out dangerous special deals to Republican campaign contributors. According to news reports, a major Republican donor stands to benefit financially from selling cellular and regenerative medical therapies. If this guy had it his way, he would be able to sell them to desperate people without a final FDA determination that those therapies were either safe or effective. Of course, that would be against the law right now. So this megadonor has poured millions of dollars into Mitch McConnell's personal campaign coffers, and into his Republican super PAC, and now he wants his reward. The Cures Act offers to sell government favors. It delivers a special deal so that people can sell these treatments without meeting the FDA gold standards for protecting patient safety and making sure that these drugs actually do some good. Keep in mind that people could die from using unproven treatments. In fact, people have already died during carefully controlled research experiments on these types of treatments. Congress should not be in the business of selling FDA favors to the highest bidders, risking people's lives to enrich political donors. Let's be clear. What the Republicans are proposing is corrupt, and it is very, very dangerous. There is more. Republicans decided to hand out gifts for other special interests. The Cures Act, a bill that is supposed to be about medical innovation, has a giveaway to the gun lobby. The bill cuts Medicare funding. It raids money from the Affordable Care Act. It takes health care dollars that should have gone to Puerto Rico. It makes it harder for people with disabilities to get Medicaid services. There is a lot of bad stuff in this bill--a lot of bad stuff. But not everything in the bill is bad. Republican leaders are playing a crafty game here, trying to buy off Democratic votes, one by one, by tacking on good, bipartisan proposals that Senators in both parties have worked on in good faith for years. There is a bipartisan mental health bill. There are bipartisan provisions protecting the genetic privacy of patients and bipartisan provisions to give some very limited funding for important priorities, such as the national opioid crisis. There is the Vice President's Cancer Moonshot. There is a proposal in here to improve foster care. I support most of these proposals. I have worked on many of them for years. I even wrote some of them myself. If this bill becomes law, there is no question it will contain some real legislative accomplishments. But I cannot vote for this bill. I will fight it because I know the differences between compromise and extortion. Compromise is putting together commonsense health proposals supported by Democrats, by Republicans, and by most of the American people, and passing them into law. Extortion is holding those exact same proposals hostage unless everyone agrees to special favors for campaign donors and giveaways to the richest drug companies in the world. Compromise is when Senators-- Democrats and Republicans--find a way forward on issues that matter to their constituents. Extortion is telling those same Senators to forget what their constituents want. We will do nothing with the skyrocketing costs of prescription drugs and nothing to increase medical research. Instead, every important commonsense bipartisan bill on mental health, genetic privacy, opioid addiction, foster care, and anything else will die today unless Democrats agree to make it easier for drug companies to commit fraud, to give out kickbacks, and to put patients' lives at risk. This demand is enough to make me gag. Scientists who invent new cures should be celebrated, along with the companies that support them. But let me be perfectly clear. While the drug industry may get a seat at the table, they do not own the table. I do not care how many armies of lawyers and lobbyists they send out. I do not care how many campaign contributions they dump into congressional pockets. I do not care how painful they can make life for politicians who oppose them. I will not be their lackey. I will work for the hundreds of thousands of scientists and doctors who are committed to saving lives and who are waiting for Congress to fund their work. I will work for the millions of families that have been touched by Alzheimer's, diabetes, cancer, and other deadly diseases who are counting on this research. I will work for the 70 percent of voters who are sick of a Congress that is owned by big donors and giant corporations. Republicans are taking over Congress. They are taking over the White House. But Republicans do not have majority support in this country. The majority of voters supported Democratic Senate candidates over Republican ones. The majority supported a Democratic Presidential candidate over a Republican one. The American people did not give Democrats majority support so we can come back to Washington and play dead. They did not send us here to whimper, whine, or grovel. They sent [[Page S6510]] us here to say no to efforts to sell Congress to the highest bidder. They sent us here to stand up for what is right. Now they are watching, waiting, and hoping--hoping that we will show some spine and start fighting back when Congress ignores the message of the American people and returns to the old ways of doing business. Republicans will control this government, but they cannot hand that control over to big corporations unless Democrats roll over and allow them to do so. It is time for Democrats--Democrats and Republicans, who should be ashamed by this kind of corruption--to make it clear exactly who they work for. Does the Senate work for Big Pharma, which hires lobbyists and people who make giant campaign contributions, or does the Senate work for the American people who actually sent us here? I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from Texas. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 169 (Monday, November 28, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6508-S6510] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] 21ST CENTURY CURES BILL Ms. WARREN.

Now, one solution would be for those companies to follow the law. But they prefer plan B: Cozy up to enough people in Congress to pass this Cures bill that would shoot holes in the anti-fraud law. In other words, make it easier for drug companies to get away with fraud. Second giveaway: Cover up bribery. Right now the law requires drug companies to disclose the buckets of money they shower on doctors and hospitals to encourage them to prescribe certain drugs. It is, by the way, all published on a government Web site. You can go look up your doctor and your hospital right now online, if you want to do that. Now, the drug companies could have responded by ending kickbacks to doctors. But instead, they have chosen plan B again: Cozy up to enough people in Congress to pass this Cures bill, which would let drug companies keep secret any splashy junkets or gifts associated with so- called medical education and make it harder for enforcement agencies to be able to trace those bribes. Senator Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, says he is outraged by this provision. I have to say that I am with Senator Grassley on this one. Third giveaway: Hand out dangerous special deals to Republican campaign contributors. According to news reports, a major Republican donor stands to benefit financially from selling cellular and regenerative medical therapies. If this guy had it his way, he would be able to sell them to desperate people without a final FDA determination that those therapies were either safe or effective. Of course, that would be against the law right now. So this megadonor has poured millions of dollars into Mitch McConnell's personal campaign coffers, and into his Republican super PAC, and now he wants his reward. The Cures Act offers to sell government favors. It delivers a special deal so that people can sell these treatments without meeting the FDA gold standards for protecting patient safety and making sure that these drugs actually do some good. Keep in mind that people could die from using unproven treatments. In fact, people have already died during carefully controlled research experiments on these types of treatments. Congress should not be in the business of selling FDA favors to the highest bidders, risking people's lives to enrich political donors. Let's be clear. What the Republicans are proposing is corrupt, and it is very, very dangerous. There is more. Republicans decided to hand out gifts for other special interests. The Cures Act, a bill that is supposed to be about medical innovation, has a giveaway to the gun lobby. The bill cuts Medicare funding. It raids money from the Affordable Care Act. It takes health care dollars that should have gone to Puerto Rico. It makes it harder for people with disabilities to get Medicaid services. There is a lot of bad stuff in this bill--a lot of bad stuff. But not everything in the bill is bad. Republican leaders are playing a crafty game here, trying to buy off Democratic votes, one by one, by tacking on good, bipartisan proposals that Senators in both parties have worked on in good faith for years. There is a bipartisan mental health bill. There are bipartisan provisions protecting the genetic privacy of patients and bipartisan provisions to give some very limited funding for important priorities, such as the national opioid crisis. There is the Vice President's Cancer Moonshot. There is a proposal in here to improve foster care. I support most of these proposals. I have worked on many of them for years. I even wrote some of them myself. If this bill becomes law, there is no question it will contain some real legislative accomplishments. But I cannot vote for this bill. I will fight it because I know the differences between compromise and extortion. Compromise is putting together commonsense health proposals supported by Democrats, by Republicans, and by most of the American people, and passing them into law. Extortion is holding those exact same proposals hostage unless everyone agrees to special favors for campaign donors and giveaways to the richest drug companies in the world. Compromise is when Senators-- Democrats and Republicans--find a way forward on issues that matter to their constituents. Extortion is telling those same Senators to forget what their constituents want. We will do nothing with the skyrocketing costs of prescription drugs and nothing to increase medical research. Instead, every important commonsense bipartisan bill on mental health, genetic privacy, opioid addiction, foster care, and anything else will die today unless Democrats agree to make it easier for drug companies to commit fraud, to give out kickbacks, and to put patients' lives at risk. This demand is enough to make me gag. Scientists who invent new cures should be celebrated, along with the companies that support them. But let me be perfectly clear. While the drug industry may get a seat at the table, they do not own the table. I do not care how many armies of lawyers and lobbyists they send out. I do not care how many campaign contributions they dump into congressional pockets. I do not care how painful they can make life for politicians who oppose them. I will not be their lackey. I will work for the hundreds of thousands of scientists and doctors who are committed to saving lives and who are waiting for Congress to fund their work. I will work for the millions of families that have been touched by Alzheimer's, diabetes, cancer, and other deadly diseases who are counting on this research. I will work for the 70 percent of voters who are sick of a Congress that is owned by big donors and giant corporations. Republicans are taking over Congress. They are taking over the White House. But Republicans do not have majority support in this country. The majority of voters supported Democratic Senate candidates over Republican ones. The majority supported a Democratic Presidential candidate over a Republican one. The American people did not give Democrats majority support so we can come back to Washington and play dead. They did not send us here to whimper, whine, or grovel. They sent [[Page S6510]] us here to say no to efforts to sell Congress to the highest bidder. They sent us here to stand up for what is right. Now they are watching, waiting, and hoping--hoping that we will show some spine and start fighting back when Congress ignores the message of the American people and returns to the old ways of doing business. Republicans will control this government, but they cannot hand that control over to big corporations unless Democrats roll over and allow them to do so. It is time for Democrats--Democrats and Republicans, who should be ashamed by this kind of corruption--to make it clear exactly who they work for. Does the Senate work for Big Pharma, which hires lobbyists and people who make giant campaign contributions, or does the Senate work for the American people who actually sent us here? I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from Texas. ____________________",package_114_209.csv,10800,10800,10871,"[congressional record volume 162, number 169 (monday, november 28, 2016)] [senate] [pages s6508-s6510] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] 21st century cures bill ms. warren. madam president, 3 weeks ago americans went to the polls. voters were deeply divided on whether democrats or republicans should be in charge. donald trump is the president-elect, missing the popular vote by more than 2 million people. but there is one thing americans are not divided on, one issue on which they sent out a message loud and clear. according to exit polls, 70 percent of voters said that they think the american economy and the lawmakers who oversee it are owned-- owned--by big companies and special interests. that is 70 percent of everyone--republicans, democrats, and independents. in the closing days of this congress, big pharma has its hand out for a bunch of special giveaways and favors that are packed together in something called the 21st century cures bill. it is on track to get a vote in the house this week and then get rammed through the senate. i have been taking a look at the details, and when the american voters say that congress is owned by big companies, this bill is exactly what they are talking about. now we face a choice: will this congress say ``yes, we are bought and paid for'' or will we stand up and work for the american people? [[page s6509]] for more than 2 years, congress has been working on legislation to help advance medical innovation in the united states. medical innovation is powerfully important, and i have spent as much time working on this issue as anything i have worked on since i joined the u.s. senate. from the beginning, i have emphasized one obvious fact: medical breakthroughs come from increasing investments in basic research. right now, congress is choking off investments in the nih. adjusted for inflation, federal spending on medical research over the past dozen years has been cut by 20 percent. those cuts take the legs out from under future medical innovations in america. we can name a piece of legislation the ``cures'' bill, but if it doesn't include significant, meaningful funding for the national institutes of health and the food and drug administration, it won't cure anything. that is why months ago senate democrats said any so- called cures legislation must have significant investment in medical research, and that is why senate republicans publicly committed to do exactly that. but now they have reneged on their promise and let big pharma hijack the cures bill. this final deal has only a tiny fig leaf of funding for nih and for the opioid crisis, and most of that fig leaf isn't even real. most of the money won't be there unless future congresses pass future bills in future years to fund those dollars. so why bother with a fig leaf in the cures bill? why pretend to give money to nih or opioids? this funding is political cover for huge giveaways to giant drug companies. there are more examples than i can count in this bill. but i am going to talk about three. first giveaway: legalize fraud. you know, it is against the law for drug companies to market drugs for uses not approved by the fda. now, some drug companies find this rule annoying. after all, they can make a lot more money selling a headache pill as a cure for everything from hair loss to cancer. but pushing treatments without scientific evidence that they work is fraud--fraud that can hurt people. it also undercuts the development of real cures. that is why some of the largest law enforcement actions against big drug companies over the past 15 years have involved off-label marketing. drug companies have paid billions of dollars in penalties. now, one solution would be for those companies to follow the law. but they prefer plan b: cozy up to enough people in congress to pass this cures bill that would shoot holes in the anti-fraud law. in other words, make it easier for drug companies

says he is outraged by this provision. i have to say that i am with senator grassley on this one. third giveaway: hand out dangerous special deals to republican campaign contributors. according to news reports, a major republican donor stands to benefit financially from selling cellular and regenerative medical therapies. if this guy had it his way, he would be able to sell them to desperate

Mr. President, while the President-elect is considering additional nominees to fill his Cabinet, we in the Senate--working together with our House colleagues--have our own responsibilities to fulfill before the end of this year. Most pressing is legislation to fund the government, something that unfortunately has been hindered by our Democratic colleagues slow- walking the appropriations process. Actually, calling it slow-walking is a little too generous. What they did is block the normal appropriations process, where the 12 separate appropriations bills would be voted out of committee--which they were, on a bipartisan basis--but then they would come across the floor of the Senate where amendments would be offered, and we would actually vote on them before sending them to the President to be signed into law. Instead of this normal process--which is transparent, it is bipartisan, in the best traditions of the Senate--we were denied the opportunity to do that, resulting now in our need to pass a year-end continuing resolution, kicking the funding of the government over to perhaps sometime in the spring. This was strictly as a result of the gamesmanship of our colleagues, many of them blocking the same appropriations bills they voted for, on a bipartisan basis, before the Appropriations Committee itself. Despite those obstructions, we have actually tried to do some good work. We passed our first bicameral budget since 2009. As I said, the Appropriations Committee voted out all 12 appropriations bills. Despite the obstructionism we have seen and despite where we find ourselves, I ask all of us to take stock of where we are, given what we saw happen in the historic election of November 8. I think the American people have made very clear they want the government to function and they don't have a lot of tolerance for gamesmanship or partisanship or obstruction, but we cannot move forward with other substantial legislative goals until we address funding for the remainder of this fiscal year. While I am disappointed we find ourselves where we are today--having to pass another short-term continuing resolution until next March or so--this waiting until the last minute is not a good way to do business. I hope next year, with the new administration and with the leadership of Senator McConnell, Speaker Ryan in the House, and with more cooperation from our Democratic colleagues, we can have a regular and open appropriations process, one that will serve the American people much better. It will certainly serve the interests of the Defense Department and other people who need to be able to plan beyond 2 months or 3 months in terms of what they can do with the money Congress is going to appropriate. Until then, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to set aside the disputes we have had over the last year and the election itself----which I know some are finding it easier to see the results of the election in the rearview mirror than others, as evidenced by the comments I heard from the Senator from Massachusetts when I came to the floor--but we need to pass a bill that will fund the government and allow us to move forward. I hope we can do that. Then, once we have completed the work for this year, we can come back in the new year with a new administration, a new Congress, and recommit ourselves to doing the people's work and doing it in a consensus-building, bipartisan way that listens to what our constituents are telling us they want, not the siren call of the people who think they know better than they do what is good for them but to listen to the American people and then get about the work of passing legislation which promotes their interests. This is first to assure for the common defense but, secondly, to make sure our economy starts to grow again so people who want to find work or want better paying jobs can find work available so they can provide for their families and pursue their American dream. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, the reason I came to the floor is to make note of the fact, as I alluded to a moment ago, that President-Elect Donald Trump announced his intention to nominate one of our own, a Member of the Senate, to be the Nation's top law enforcement officer. Our friend, the junior Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions, is undoubtedly qualified and prepared for this role as Attorney General because of the long career he spent protecting and defending our Constitution and the rule of law. If there is one thing we can do in the U.S. Government to help restore the public's confidence, it will be to reembrace the concept of equal justice under the law and ensure there is not a double standard by which people are judged--the powerful, the well-connected, and then the rules that apply to everybody else--but, rather, that the same rules apply to all of us. The same laws apply to all of us. In fact, that is the bulwark of our constitutional democracy. Frankly, I think the American people have seen, in the last two Attorneys General--the current one and her predecessor, Mr. Holder--is essentially an office of the Department of Justice that was not worthy of the name ``Justice.'' It should have been called an extension of the White House political operation because so much of the way they conducted themselves was governed not by the rule of law but by political considerations. Our friend, the Senator from Alabama, understands firsthand the importance of hard work as well. He is the son of a country store owner from Hybart, AL. He received his law degree from the University of Alabama. He served in the U.S. Army Reserves. As we know, his service didn't stop there. Guided by a sense of duty for the last five decades, Jeff Sessions has dedicated his life to the State of Alabama and to the United States itself, first as a Federal prosecutor--including 12 years as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Alabama, then as the State's attorney general, and now in the Senate where he has served with distinction for the last decade- plus. Above all, Jeff Sessions has worked for the people of his State and this country with one purpose in mind; that is, to uphold the rule of law. His career in the Senate reflects this earnest commitment to do what is right, not what is popular, not what is politically convenient but to do what is right, guided by the Constitution, the laws, and inspired by the people he was elected to serve. He has been a defender of our military families and played a leading role in ensuring that rural communities have the health care they need. I understand the long knives are already starting to come out against President-Elect Trump's nominees and that Senator Sessions--our colleague from Alabama--is not going to be spared some of those attacks, but I would ask some of these critics who don't know his entire record to consider the fact that a few years ago he teamed up with the senior Senator from Illinois to reform sentencing charges on crack cocaine, sentencing charges that disproportionately discriminate against African-American communities. It was a bipartisan solution that in Jeff's words, ``achieve fairness without impeding our ability to combat drug violence.'' I would also ask these critics to consider the bill he introduced with Senator Ted Kennedy, the now-departed ``liberal lion of the Senate,'' to use grant funding to reduce sexual assaults in prison. The legislation requires the Department of Justice to keep track of these assaults, and it was signed into law by President George W. Bush. Taken legislatively, these are not the sorts of actions that fit this distorted picture that some of the critics are already starting to draw about Senator Sessions and his record in the Senate or his character as a man. [[Page S6511]] I have had the honor of working closely with Jeff on the Senate Judiciary Committee since I came to the Senate, and I am proud to call him a friend. Those who have watched him day-in and day-out understand his stalwart commitment to the rule of law and his deep and abiding concern for our country. Of course, we wouldn't be Senators if we didn't sometimes disagree with each other. It is just normal, but Senator Sessions has always engaged with seriousness and cordiality and the kind of civility this Chamber and this country could use more of. By the strength of his arguments, he has helped us all to see the weaknesses in our own arguments as he has worked together with his colleagues to try to help us build consensus, which is the only way we get anything done and the way our constitutional system was designed. Only by building consensus can we move our country forward. We are going to miss Senator Sessions in the Senate when he moves on to the executive branch as Attorney General, but it is even more important, at this point in this country's history, to have a champion of the Constitution and the rule of law at the Department of Justice and to help restore the reputation of that Department. As I said earlier, for years now--during the course of Attorney General Holder's tenure and unfortunately succeeded by Attorney General Lynch--the Department of Justice has twisted the Constitution to further the President's political agenda. I give just one example. When Congress was performing its legitimate oversight responsibilities into a gun-running operation gone wrong called Fast and Furious, Attorney General Holder was called before the Senate Judiciary Committee, called before our corresponding House committee, and simply defied those committees' lawful and appropriate oversight responsibilities over what the Department of Justice was doing. To my knowledge, this resulted in his having been the first Attorney General to be held in contempt of Congress--a sitting Attorney General of the United States held in contempt of Congress. Unfortunately, the Obama administration put politics ahead of our national commitment to the rule of law and too often demonized those who worked to protect us. I have every confidence that Senator Sessions, as the Attorney General of the United States, the head of the Department of Justice, and the Trump administration will defend the rule of law and will use his expertise in the Constitution to play an essential role in our President-elect's Cabinet. As a 15-year veteran of the Department, Senator Sessions understands better than most what needs to be done to help the Department of Justice refocus its responsibilities and its priorities. Here is the bottom line. We need people in the highest rungs of our government who will ensure our Constitution is preserved, protected, and defended.

(vii) Sensitivity of Technology Contained in the Defense Article or Defense Services Proposed to be Sold: See Annex Attached. (viii) Date Report Delivered to Congress: November 28. 2016. * As defined in Section 47(6) of the Arms Export Control Act. POLICY JUSTIFICATION Poland--JASSM-ER with Support The Government of Poland has requested a possible sale of seventy (70) AGM-158B Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles Extended Range (JASSM-ER), two (2) AGM-158B Flight Test Vehicles, two (2) AGM-158B Mass Simulant Vehicles, one (1) AGM-158B Flight Test Vehicle--Captive Carry, three (3) AGM- 158B Separation Test Vehicles. Also included are two (2) AGM- 158B Weapon System Simulators, F-16 operational flight plan upgrade for the Polish F-16C/D, JASSM-ER integration, missile containers, spare and repair parts, support and test equipment, publications and technical documentation, personnel training and training equipment, U.S. Government and contractor engineering, technical and logistics support services, and other related elements of logistical and program support. The total estimated program value is $200 million. The proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy and the national security objectives of the United States by helping to improve the security of a NATO ally. Poland continues to be an important force for political stability and economic progress in Central Europe. The proposed sale will improve Poland's capability to meet current and future threats of enemy air and ground weapons systems. Poland will use the enhanced capability as a deterrent to regional threats and to strengthen its homeland defense. These weapon and capabilities upgrades will allow Poland to strengthen its air-to-ground strike capabilities and increase its contribution to future NATO operations. Poland will have no difficulty absorbing these missiles into its armed forces. The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not alter the basic military balance in the region. The prime contractor will be the Lockheed Martin Corporation of Ft. Worth, Texas. There are no known offset agreements proposed in connection with this potential sale. Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor representatives to Poland. There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness as a result of this proposed sale. Transmittal No. 16-72 Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act Annex Item No. vii (vii) Sensitivity of Technology 1. The AGM-158B JASSM ER is an extended range low- observable, highly survivable subsonic cruise missile designed to penetrate next generation air defense systems en- route to target. It is designed to kill hard, medium- hardened, soft and area type targets. The extended range over the baseline was obtained by going from a turbo-jet to a turbo-fan engine and by reconfiguring the fuel tanks for added capacity. Classification of the technical data and information on the AGM-158's performance, capabilities, systems, sub-systems, operations, and maintenance will range from UNCLASSIFIED to SECRET. 2. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the information could be used to develop countermeasures that might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with similar or advanced capabilities. 3. A determination has been made that Poland can provide substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive technology being released as the U.S. Government. This proposed sale is necessary to further the US foreign policy and national security objectives outlined in the Policy Justification. 4. All defense articles and services listed in this transmittal are authorized for release and export to Poland. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 169 (Monday, November 28, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6511-S6512] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ARMS SALES NOTIFICATION Mr. CORKER.

(viii) Date Report Delivered to Congress: November 28. 2016. * As defined in Section 47(6) of the Arms Export Control Act. POLICY JUSTIFICATION Poland--JASSM-ER with Support The Government of Poland has requested a possible sale of seventy (70) AGM-158B Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles Extended Range (JASSM-ER), two (2) AGM-158B Flight Test Vehicles, two (2) AGM-158B Mass Simulant Vehicles, one (1) AGM-158B Flight Test Vehicle--Captive Carry, three (3) AGM- 158B Separation Test Vehicles. Also included are two (2) AGM- 158B Weapon System Simulators, F-16 operational flight plan upgrade for the Polish F-16C/D, JASSM-ER integration, missile containers, spare and repair parts, support and test equipment, publications and technical documentation, personnel training and training equipment, U.S. Government and contractor engineering, technical and logistics support services, and other related elements of logistical and program support. The total estimated program value is $200 million. The proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy and the national security objectives of the United States by helping to improve the security of a NATO ally. Poland continues to be an important force for political stability and economic progress in Central Europe. The proposed sale will improve Poland's capability to meet current and future threats of enemy air and ground weapons systems. Poland will use the enhanced capability as a deterrent to regional threats and to strengthen its homeland defense. These weapon and capabilities upgrades will allow Poland to strengthen its air-to-ground strike capabilities and increase its contribution to future NATO operations. Poland will have no difficulty absorbing these missiles into its armed forces. The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not alter the basic military balance in the region. The prime contractor will be the Lockheed Martin Corporation of Ft. Worth, Texas. There are no known offset agreements proposed in connection with this potential sale. Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor representatives to Poland. There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness as a result of this proposed sale. Transmittal No. 16-72 Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act Annex Item No. vii (vii) Sensitivity of Technology 1. The AGM-158B JASSM ER is an extended range low- observable, highly survivable subsonic cruise missile designed to penetrate next generation air defense systems en- route to target. It is designed to kill hard, medium- hardened, soft and area type targets. The extended range over the baseline was obtained by going from a turbo-jet to a turbo-fan engine and by reconfiguring the fuel tanks for added capacity. Classification of the technical data and information on the AGM-158's performance, capabilities, systems, sub-systems, operations, and maintenance will range from UNCLASSIFIED to SECRET. 2. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the information could be used to develop countermeasures that might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with similar or advanced capabilities. 3. A determination has been made that Poland can provide substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive technology being released as the U.S. Government. This proposed sale is necessary to further the US foreign policy and national security objectives outlined in the Policy Justification. 4. All defense articles and services listed in this transmittal are authorized for release and export to Poland. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 169 (Monday, November 28, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 169 (Monday, November 28, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6511-S6512] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ARMS SALES NOTIFICATION Mr. CORKER.

CREC-2016-11-28-pt1-PgS6512-2,CREC-2016-11-28,114,TRIBUTE TO ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 169 (Monday, November 28, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6512-S6513] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, today I wish to express my profound appreciation and best wishes to my friend, Alejandro Mayorkas, who recently stepped down as the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. During his 7 years of public service at DHS, Ali has been a dedicated and thoughtful leader and was instrumental to the advancement and accomplishments at the Department. Ali arrived at DHS in 2009 with an already impressive record in public service which included over 20 years of distinguished service in law enforcement. As an assistant U.S. attorney for the Central District of California, he aggressively prosecuted drug traffickers, human smugglers, and violent criminals. As U.S. attorney for the Central District of California, he led the largest Federal judicial office in the United States and was appointed by then Attorney General Janet Reno to serve on her advisory committee on ethics and government. Ali continued his public service as the Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, USCIS, where he oversaw a $3 billion annual budget and led a workforce of 18,000 individuals. To that end, Ali's accomplishments as the USCIS Director included the development of the special parole program which worked to rescue children who tragically lost their parents to the January 2010 earthquake in Haiti. He continued his humanitarian efforts and dedication to help orphan children by creating a program that allowed international adoption of orphans in Guatemala. These stunning achievements have been widely praised by many who have had the honor to work alongside Ali. In his most recent role as Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security, Ali served as the second-in-command of the third largest Department in the U.S. Government. In this role, Ali ensured that a $60 billion budget was spent wisely and effectively, while at the same time leading a workforce of nearly 230,000 individuals. Like a true leader, Ali understands the importance of taking care of the Department's employees and recognizes that they are its greatest asset. He worked tirelessly [[Page S6513]] to increase employee morale and, for the last few years, was particularly focused on improving employee engagement with senior leaders. His steadfast dedication to this effort, along with those of Secretary Jeh Johnson, resulted in rising employee satisfaction at DHS this past year. Ali's commitment to making the Department a more unified entity is yet another example of his extraordinary ability to mobilize, manage, and lead people with integrity and selflessness. Ali's achievements are not limited to domestic operations. As the highest ranking Cuban American in the Obama administration, Ali secured the first homeland security agreement with the Government of Cuba, allowing increased trade, sea and air travel, and tourism between the two nations. His work to facilitate international trade, redesign the Nation's refugee admissions process, and enhance the Visa Waiver Program has resulted in many successful international partnerships. In order to ensure our Nation's protection in cyber security, Ali has worked closely with international leaders to promote cyber security research and innovation, which has ultimately created a more reliable and effective cyber space at home and abroad. For instance, Ali led delegations in negotiating a cyber security partnership with the State of Israel, as well as the Department's negotiation of a cyber security agreement with China. These efforts and others have been fundamental to the protection of our Nation's cyber community. Under his leadership, the Department's key counterterrorism efforts have been significantly strengthened. Ali improved national security vetting protocols, enhanced aviation and border security, and distributed counterterrorism intelligence to State, local, and tribal law enforcement. This collaboration has enhanced the Federal Government's national security partnership with first responders and has allowed for a more reliable and fruitful system. During a time filled with constant threats and endangerments, Ali has continually proven to be a vital leader of DHS operations, ultimately ensuring that our Nation is a safe and secure place. I wish Ali, his wife, Tanya, and their family all the best in this next chapter in their lives. I sincerely thank him for his invaluable service to the Department and to our Nation. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 169 (Monday, November 28, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6512-S6513] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS Mr. CARPER.

Ali's commitment to making the Department a more unified entity is yet another example of his extraordinary ability to mobilize, manage, and lead people with integrity and selflessness. Ali's achievements are not limited to domestic operations. As the highest ranking Cuban American in the Obama administration, Ali secured the first homeland security agreement with the Government of Cuba, allowing increased trade, sea and air travel, and tourism between the two nations. His work to facilitate international trade, redesign the Nation's refugee admissions process, and enhance the Visa Waiver Program has resulted in many successful international partnerships. In order to ensure our Nation's protection in cyber security, Ali has worked closely with international leaders to promote cyber security research and innovation, which has ultimately created a more reliable and effective cyber space at home and abroad. For instance, Ali led delegations in negotiating a cyber security partnership with the State of Israel, as well as the Department's negotiation of a cyber security agreement with China. These efforts and others have been fundamental to the protection of our Nation's cyber community. Under his leadership, the Department's key counterterrorism efforts have been significantly strengthened. Ali improved national security vetting protocols, enhanced aviation and border security, and distributed counterterrorism intelligence to State, local, and tribal law enforcement. This collaboration has enhanced the Federal Government's national security partnership with first responders and has allowed for a more reliable and fruitful system. During a time filled with constant threats and endangerments, Ali has continually proven to be a vital leader of DHS operations, ultimately ensuring that our Nation is a safe and secure place. I wish Ali, his wife, Tanya, and their family all the best in this next chapter in their lives. I sincerely thank him for his invaluable service to the Department and to our Nation. ____________________",package_114_209.csv,4665,4665,4736,"[congressional record volume 162, number 169 (monday, november 28, 2016)] [senate] [pages s6512-s6513] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] tribute to alejandro mayorkas mr. carper. mr. president, today i wish to express my profound appreciation and best wishes to my friend, alejandro mayorkas, who recently stepped down as the deputy secretary of the department of homeland security. during his 7 years of public service at dhs, ali has been a dedicated and thoughtful leader and was instrumental to the advancement and accomplishments at the department. ali arrived at dhs in 2009 with an already impressive record in public service which included over 20 years of distinguished service in law enforcement. as an assistant u.s. attorney for the central district of california, he aggressively prosecuted drug traffickers, human smugglers, and violent criminals. as u.s. attorney for the central district of california, he led the largest federal judicial office in the united states and was appointed by then attorney general janet reno to serve on her advisory committee on ethics and government. ali continued his public service as the director of u.s. citizenship and immigration services, uscis, where he oversaw a $3 billion annual budget and led a workforce of 18,000 individuals. to that end, ali's accomplishments as the uscis director included the development of the special parole program which worked to rescue children who tragically lost their parents to the january 2010 earthquake in haiti. he continued his humanitarian efforts and dedication to help orphan children by creating a program that allowed international adoption of orphans in guatemala. these stunning achievements have been widely praised by many who have had the honor to work alongside ali. in his most recent role as deputy secretary of homeland security, ali served as the second-in-command of the third largest department in the u.s. government. in this role, ali ensured that a $60 billion budget was spent wisely and effectively, while at the same time leading a workforce of nearly 230,000 individuals. like a true leader, ali understands the importance of taking care of the department's employees and recognizes that they are its greatest asset. he worked tirelessly [[page s6513]] to increase employee morale and, for the last few years, was particularly focused on improving employee engagement with senior leaders. his steadfast dedication to this effort, along with those of secretary jeh johnson, resulted in rising employee satisfaction at dhs this past year. ali's commitment to making the department a more unified entity is yet another example of his extraordinary ability to mobilize, manage, and lead people with integrity and selflessness. ali's achievements are not limited to domestic operations. as the highest ranking cuban american in the obama administration, ali secured the first homeland security agreement with the government of cuba, allowing increased trade, sea and air travel, and tourism between the two nations. his work to facilitate international trade, redesign the nation's refugee admissions process, and enhance the visa waiver program has resulted in many successful international partnerships. in order to ensure our nation's protection in cyber security, ali has worked closely with international leaders to promote cyber security research and innovation, which has ultimately created a more reliable and effective cyber space at home and abroad. for instance, ali led delegations in negotiating a cyber security partnership with the state of israel, as well as the department's negotiation of a cyber security agreement with china. these efforts and others have been fundamental to the protection of our nation's cyber community. under his leadership, the department's key counterterrorism efforts have been significantly strengthened. ali improved national security vetting protocols, enhanced aviation and border security, and distributed counterterrorism intelligence to state, local, and tribal law enforcement. this collaboration has enhanced the federal government's national security partnership with first responders and has allowed for a more reliable and fruitful system. during a time filled with constant threats and endangerments, ali has continually proven to be a vital leader of dhs operations, ultimately ensuring that our nation is a safe and secure place. i wish ali, his wife, tanya, and their family all the best in this next chapter in their lives. i sincerely thank him for his invaluable service to the department and to our nation. ____________________",4665

Mr. President, today I would like to take the opportunity to recognize Mr. Jay Grinney, the president and chief executive officer of HealthSouth Corporation. Mr. Grinney will be retiring from his position at the end of 2016, and his tenure at HealthSouth has been marked with success and expansion for the company. Jay Grinney earned his bachelor's degree from St. Olaf College and received a masters of business administration and a masters of health care administration from Washington University. He served as senior vice president at the Methodist hospital system in Houston, the primary teaching affiliate for the Baylor College of Medicine, then went on to become president of the Eastern Group at Hospital Corporation of America, the Nation's largest health care company. Jay Grinney has been with HealthSouth for over 20 years and served as president and CEO since 2004. Throughout his career, he has maintained a strong work ethic and exercised excellent management of every organization he has led. Mr. Grinney's leadership at HealthSouth Corporation in particular cannot be underappreciated. HealthSouth is one of the Nation's largest providers of postacute health care services, offering both facility- based and home-based postacute services in 33 States and Puerto Rico through its inpatient rehabilitation clinics. Mr. Grinney became CEO at a critical time in HealthSouth's history and engineered the company's turnaround and repositioning as one of the Nation's leading providers of postacute services. He has overseen the diversification of the company and ensured its financial stability and future. He led the HealthSouth acquisition of Encompass Home Health and Hospice, Reliant Hospital Partners, and [[Page S6514]] CareSouth, successfully expanding the HealthSouth network to 34 States. Along the way, he established a strong senior management team to ensure growth for HealthSouth in the years to come. For the over 20 years I have known Mr. Grinney, he has proven himself to be a man of great character, and without his guidance, HealthSouth would not be the company it is today. HealthSouth's head corporation office is located in Birmingham, AL, and HealthSouth operates five rehabilitation hospitals and one outpatient rehabilitation clinic across the State. The company provides jobs to hundreds of Alabamians and quality health care to so many more. Jay Grinney's strong leadership and dedication have enabled this company to continue to provide critical care to our communities. Mr. Grinney himself is involved with a number of community organizations, serving on the boards of directors of the Birmingham Business Alliance, where he is on the executive committee, the Community Foundation of Greater Birmingham, where he is chairman of the audit committee, and the Public Affairs Research Council of Alabama. He previously served as chairman of the board of directors of the Federation of American Hospitals and as a director on the boards of directors of the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute and the United Way of Central Alabama. Though Mr. Grinney was not born in Alabama, he embodies all the qualities we most appreciate and respect. I speak for the citizens of Alabama when I thank Jay Grinney for all the work he has done for our State and so many others across the country through his tenure at HealthSouth. Mr. Grinney will be greatly missed, but the effects of his leadership will guarantee the growth and success of this company for years to come. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 169 (Monday, November 28, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6513-S6514] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO JAY GRINNEY Mr. SESSIONS.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 150th anniversary of the city of Saline, MI, which was incorporated as a village in 1866. I appreciate the opportunity to celebrate the history of this wonderful community, which has been consistently ranked as one of the best places to live in the United States. Before Europeans first settled the area, Native Americans frequently canoed from Lake Erie or traveled over six different trails to hunt in the area and harvest salt, which they used domestically and for trade. In fact, it was the discovery of this important mineral that inspired French voyageurs to name the local river Saline after the French word for ``salt''. Following the War of 1812, the U.S. Government recognized the need for a military road connecting Detroit and Chicago and hired Mr. Orange Risdon to survey the new route, which would eventually be known as U.S. 12 or Michigan Avenue. Risdon, enchanted by the land around Saline, decided to settle in the area. Risdon purchased 164 acres from the U.S. Government on April 5, 1825, built a house, and began promoting the area to English and German settlers from New England and New York, as well as a small number of African-American families. The families that joined Risdon agreed to name their new community Saline, which was platted as an unincorporated village in 1832 and became an incorporated village in 1866 after consolidating with the neighboring settlement of Barnegat in 1848. As an important stop for stagecoaches traveling between Detroit and Chicago, Saline attracted a number of artisan workshops and mills to complement its local agricultural industry. A desire for an affordable and reliable way to transport crops to market inspired farmers and merchants in Saline to raise funds for a railroad line connecting the community with Hillsdale and Ypsilanti, which opened for service on July 4, 1870. The railroad served Saline for nearly 100 years, transporting apples, wool, lumber and livestock, as well as finished goods sold in local stores. By 1875, Saline was the principal agricultural shipping point in southeast Michigan, with 700 residents who enjoyed a 3-story school building, 4 churches, 3 flouring-mills, 2 tanneries, a foundry, 2 hotels, several stores, a newspaper, and daily mail. Saline continued to grow over the 20th century, even during the Great Depression. The Old Union School was demolished in 1930 and replaced by an Art Deco building that continued to serve as the community's school. In 1932, Saline Valley Farms was established. This farming cooperative consisted of 1,000 acres and attracted struggling families during the Great Depression. Over 100 people lived on the farm with their families, working cooperatively in the farm's dairy, orchards, poultry house, and gardens. The farm's success encouraged members to sell goods to the public with a storefront, as well as delivery vans that brought fresh produce and canned goods to Detroit and its suburbs. Many of the farm's families were attracted from outside Saline but continued to live in the area even after the venture closed in the 1950s. During World War II, many of Saline's young men and women went to work at the Ford Assembly Plant at Willow Run, which famously produced almost half of all the B-24 Liberator heavy bombers used during the war. In the decades since, Saline has continued to be a thriving community known for its open rural vistas and small town atmosphere. It has also continued to be an important driver of economic growth and innovation as home to a variety of major technical centers and manufacturing sites. Its nearly 10,000 residents enjoy well-maintained historic homes, a district library, a hospital, parks, recreation, art, and a museum. It has held true to the words expressed by Orange Risdon in 1840, when he wished that Saline would continue to ``shine in light, knowledge and liberty with the same increasing brilliance that she has shown from infancy to present time.'' I am proud to represent Saline in the U.S. Senate, and I wish the community many more years of success. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 169 (Monday, November 28, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S6513] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS ______ 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF SALINE, MICHIGAN Mr. PETERS.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 150th anniversary of the city of Saline, MI, which was incorporated as a village in 1866. I appreciate the opportunity to celebrate the history of this wonderful community, which has been consistently ranked as one of the best places to live in the United States. Before Europeans first settled the area, Native Americans frequently canoed from Lake Erie or traveled over six different trails to hunt in the area and harvest salt, which they used domestically and for trade. In fact, it was the discovery of this important mineral that inspired French voyageurs to name the local river Saline after the French word for ``salt''. Following the War of 1812, the U.S. Government recognized the need for a military road connecting Detroit and Chicago and hired Mr. Orange Risdon to survey the new route, which would eventually be known as U.S. 12 or Michigan Avenue. Risdon, enchanted by the land around Saline, decided to settle in the area. Risdon purchased 164 acres from the U.S. Government on April 5, 1825, built a house, and began promoting the area to English and German settlers from New England and New York, as well as a small number of African-American families. The families that joined Risdon agreed to name their new community Saline, which was platted as an unincorporated village in 1832 and became an incorporated village in 1866 after consolidating with the neighboring settlement of Barnegat in 1848. As an important stop for stagecoaches traveling between Detroit and Chicago, Saline attracted a number of artisan workshops and mills to complement its local agricultural industry. A desire for an affordable and reliable way to transport crops to market inspired farmers and merchants in Saline to raise funds for a railroad line connecting the community with Hillsdale and Ypsilanti, which opened for service on July 4, 1870. The railroad served Saline for nearly 100 years, transporting apples, wool, lumber and livestock, as well as finished goods sold in local stores. By 1875, Saline was the principal agricultural shipping point in southeast Michigan, with 700 residents who enjoyed a 3-story school building, 4 churches, 3 flouring-mills, 2 tanneries, a foundry, 2 hotels, several stores, a newspaper, and daily mail. Saline continued to grow over the 20th century, even during the Great Depression. The Old Union School was demolished in 1930 and replaced by an Art Deco building that continued to serve as the community's school. In 1932, Saline Valley Farms was established. This farming cooperative consisted of 1,000 acres and attracted struggling families during the Great Depression. Over 100 people lived on the farm with their families, working cooperatively in the farm's dairy, orchards, poultry house, and gardens. The farm's success encouraged members to sell goods to the public with a storefront, as well as delivery vans that brought fresh produce and canned goods to Detroit and its suburbs. Many of the farm's families were attracted from outside Saline but continued to live in the area even after the venture closed in the 1950s. During World War II, many of Saline's young men and women went to work at the Ford Assembly Plant at Willow Run, which famously produced almost half of all the B-24 Liberator heavy bombers used during the war. In the decades since, Saline has continued to be a thriving community known for its open rural vistas and small town atmosphere. It has also continued to be an important driver of economic growth and innovation as home to a variety of major technical centers and manufacturing sites. Its nearly 10,000 residents enjoy well-maintained historic homes, a district library, a hospital, parks, recreation, art, and a museum. It has held true to the words expressed by Orange Risdon in 1840, when he wished that Saline would continue to ``shine in light, knowledge and liberty with the same increasing brilliance that she has shown from infancy to present time.'' I am proud to represent Saline in the U.S. Senate, and I wish the community many more years of success. ____________________",package_114_209.csv,4380,4380,4451,"[congressional record volume 162, number 169 (monday, november 28, 2016)] [senate] [page s6513] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] additional statements ______ 150th anniversary of saline, michigan mr. peters. mr. president, today i wish to recognize the 150th anniversary of the city of saline, mi, which was incorporated as a village in 1866. i appreciate the opportunity to celebrate the history of this wonderful community, which has been consistently ranked as one of the best places to live in the united states. before europeans first settled the area, native americans frequently canoed from lake erie or traveled over six different trails to hunt in the area and harvest salt, which they used domestically and for trade. in fact, it was the discovery of this important mineral that inspired french voyageurs to name the local river saline after the french word for ``salt''. following the war of 1812, the u.s. government recognized the need for a military road connecting detroit and chicago and hired mr. orange risdon to survey the new route, which would eventually be known as u.s. 12 or michigan avenue. risdon, enchanted by the land around saline, decided to settle in the area. risdon purchased 164 acres from the u.s. government on april 5, 1825, built a house, and began promoting the area to english and german settlers from new england and new york, as well as a small number of african-american families. the families that joined risdon agreed to name their new community saline, which was platted as an unincorporated village in 1832 and became an incorporated village in 1866 after consolidating with the neighboring settlement of barnegat in 1848. as an important stop for stagecoaches traveling between detroit and chicago, saline attracted a number of artisan workshops and mills to complement its local agricultural industry. a desire for an affordable and reliable way to transport crops to market inspired farmers and merchants in saline to raise funds for a railroad line connecting the community with hillsdale and ypsilanti, which opened for service on july 4, 1870. the railroad served saline for nearly 100 years, transporting apples, wool, lumber and livestock, as well as finished goods sold in local stores. by 1875, saline was the principal agricultural shipping point in southeast michigan, with 700 residents who enjoyed a 3-story school building, 4 churches, 3 flouring-mills, 2 tanneries, a foundry, 2 hotels, several stores, a newspaper, and daily mail. saline continued to grow over the 20th century, even during the great depression. the old union school was demolished in 1930 and replaced by an art deco building that continued to serve as the community's school. in 1932, saline valley farms was established. this farming cooperative consisted of 1,000 acres and attracted struggling families during the great depression. over 100 people lived on the farm with their families, working cooperatively in the farm's dairy, orchards, poultry house, and gardens. the farm's success encouraged members to sell goods to the public with a storefront, as well as delivery vans that brought fresh produce and canned goods to detroit and its suburbs. many of the farm's families were attracted from outside saline but continued to live in the area even after the venture closed in the 1950s. during world war ii, many of saline's young men and women went to work at the ford assembly plant at willow run, which famously produced almost half of all the b-24 liberator heavy bombers used during the war. in the decades since, saline has continued to be a thriving community known for its open rural vistas and small town atmosphere. it has also continued to be an important driver of economic growth and innovation as home to a variety of major technical centers and manufacturing sites. its nearly 10,000 residents enjoy well-maintained historic homes, a district library, a hospital, parks, recreation, art, and a museum. it has held true to the words expressed by orange risdon in 1840, when he wished that saline would continue to ``shine in light, knowledge and liberty with the same increasing brilliance that she has shown from infancy to present time.'' i am proud to represent saline in the u.s. senate, and i wish the community many more years of success. ____________________",4380
