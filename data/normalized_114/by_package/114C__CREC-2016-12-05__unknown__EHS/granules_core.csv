The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Emmer) for 5 minutes. Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate one of Minnesota's most promising student athletes, St. John's linebacker Carter Hanson. Carter has been chosen as one of the semifinalists for the prestigious Gagliardi Trophy. This trophy is named after the former St. John's University Hall of Fame, renowned football coach John Gagliardi and is given to the best Division III football player of the year. Carter Hanson has started every season for 4 years, was a preseason All-American, and this year led his team in tackles. Carter doesn't just excel on the football field, but in the classroom and the community as well. He has maintained a 4.0 grade point average for 4 years, and this year, he has been selected as the only Division III finalist for the National Football Foundation's Campbell Trophy, which is given to the best student athlete in football. Carter is a global business leadership major. He has already put his degree to good work by volunteering in Haiti and for organizations like Kids Against Hunger and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. I am proud that a young man like Carter hails from the great State of Minnesota, and I am positive that we are going to see great accomplishments from him in the future. The winner of the Gagliardi Trophy will be announced shortly, and while there is great competition, I am convinced that no one is more deserving than Carter Hanson. Celebrating Mike Gohman of W. Gohman Construction Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Mike Gohman of W. Gohman Construction for being named Builder of the Year by the Builders Association of Minnesota. W. Gohman Construction was established in 1950 by Mike's grandfather, Willard Gohman, out of his shed. Like many of Minnesota's small businesses, this company has evolved and grown. Today Mike is the third generation to own and run this incredible company, and he continually works to uphold the integrity that his father and his grandfather started. To Mike, it has never been just about the success of his company, but of the building industry as a whole. He has been an active member of the Builders Association of Minnesota and the Central Minnesota Builders Association, working to represent his and other companies throughout the St. Cloud community and our State. Mike always goes above and beyond by hosting job site tours, advocating for the building industry at the State capitol, as well as educating elected officials on the issues and concerns of his field. He even recently represented his company and industry at a roundtable we hosted to explain their concerns about our Nation's failing healthcare system. Mike is a true asset to our community and the building industry. He is well deserving of being named Builder of the Year. Congratulations, Mike. Dodd-Frank Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, the consequences of the Great Recession have been all too real: homes and jobs lost, retirement plans ruined, and fewer opportunities for Americans from all walks of life. Unfortunately, Dodd-Frank has further entrenched the too-big-to-fail bailout mentality, done little to reduce the likelihood of another severe recession, and hindered economic growth. Thankfully, the Systemic Risk Designation Improvement Act amends the one-size-fits-all approach to regulation taken by Dodd-Frank for large banks, providing a more tailored assessment of these financial institutions when determining their level of risk. This law will require regulators to examine a range of indicators--not just the size of a bank--to understand whether or not a bank could threaten the financial integrity of the United States and whether it should be designated as systemically important. This reform will provide a more pragmatic approach to regulation, which will make the American economy stronger.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 3395) to require limitations on prescribed burns. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: S. 3395 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Prescribed Burn Approval Act of 2016''. SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. In this Act: (1) National fire danger rating system.--The term ``national fire danger rating system'' means the national system used to provide a measure of fire danger according to a range of low to moderate to high to very high to extreme. (2) Prescribed burn.--The term ``prescribed burn'' means a planned fire intentionally ignited. (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the Chief of the Forest Service. SEC. 3. LIMITATIONS ON PRESCRIBED BURNS. (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (b), the Secretary shall not authorize a prescribed burn on Forest Service land if, for the county or contiguous county in which the land is located, the national fire danger rating system indicates an extreme fire danger level. (b) Exception.--The Secretary may authorize a prescribed burn under a condition described in subsection (a) if the Secretary coordinates with the applicable State government and local fire officials. (c) Report.--At the end of each fiscal year, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report describing-- (1) the number and locations of prescribed burns during that fiscal year; and (2) each prescribed burn during that fiscal year that was authorized by the Secretary pursuant to subsection (b). The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Peterson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma. General Leave Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. {time} 1730 Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of S. 3395, the Prescribed Burn Approval Act of 2016. Across much of the country, Forest Service land borders private lands that are essential to the livelihood of farmers, ranchers, and foresters. While the Forest Service is tasked with managing these lands, many techniques are effective but carry risk. On April 3, 2013, the Forest Service conducted a controlled burn on the Dakota Prairie Grasslands intended for 130 acres. As weather conditions changed, the fire escaped its boundary and burned 16,000 acres of private land. The prescribed burn planned by Federal officials resulted in millions of dollars in damage to private lands in South Dakota, with ranchers losing valuable pasture, hay, fence, and structures. In the aftermath of the fire, the Office of the General Counsel of USDA determined that the Forest Service had done nothing out of line and claimed no responsibility to those harmed by this carelessness. This commonsense piece of legislation that we are addressing today, simply put, would require the Forest Service to conduct prescribed burns only when the national fire rating system indicates that it is safe to do so in that county and contiguous counties. Furthermore, this bill will encourage greater collaboration with local officials, helping to mitigate more of the risk to private lands. We all strive to be good neighbors and hope our neighbors will do the same. With passage, this bill gives many neighbors to the Forest Service additional certainty, and I urge your support. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. House of Representatives, Committee on Natural Resources, Washington, DC, December 1, 2016. Hon. K. Michael Conaway, Chairman, Committee on Agriculture, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: I write regarding S. 3395, the Prescribed Burn Approval Act of 2016. This bill contains provisions under the jurisdiction of the Committee on Natural Resources. I recognize and appreciate your desire to bring this bill before the House of Representatives in an expeditious manner, and accordingly, I will agree that the Committee on Natural Resources be discharged from further consideration of the bill. I do so with the understanding that this action does not affect the jurisdiction of the Committee on Natural Resources. I also ask that a copy of this letter and your response be included in the Congressional Record during consideration of S. 3395 on the House floor.

The bill was agreed to in the Senate on November 17, 2016, and was referred in the House primarily to the Committee on Agriculture, with an additional referral to the Committee on Natural Resources. I ask that you allow the Committee on Natural Resources to be discharged from further consideration of the bill so that it may be scheduled by the Majority Leader. This discharge in no way affects your Committee's jurisdiction over the subject matter of [[Page H7160]] the bill, and it will not serve as precedent for future referrals. In addition, should a conference on the bill be necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee on Natural Resources represented on the conference committee. Finally, I would be pleased to include this letter and any response in Congressional Record to memorialize our mutual understanding. Thank you for your consideration and for your continued cooperation between our committees. Sincerely, K. Michael Conaway, Chairman. Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the Prescribed Burn Approval Act of 2016, S. 3395, will help alleviate unintentional disasters when prescribed burns don't go exactly as planned. This is commonsense legislation, and I urge my colleagues to vote in support of it. Prescribed burns are an important tool used by the Forest Service to help manage our national forests and grasslands. However, there is the risk of damage to nearby private property when prescribed burns get out of control, which happened, as was described recently, in the upper Midwest. This bill will allow the Forest Service to continue to use prescribed burns while taking practical steps to prevent disasters. S. 3395 prohibits the Forest Service from utilizing prescribed burns in areas of high fire risk, unless the Forest Service coordinates with State governments and local officials. Having local officials and responders aware of activities can help them be prepared and equipped to assist, if necessary. Frankly, this is something I would hope the Forest Service is already doing, but this bill is a good step. It will make sure that it happens in the future. Again, I urge my colleagues to support the bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from South Dakota (Mrs. Noem), who not only understands these issues but lives these issues. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding to me today. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of S. 3395, the Prescribed Burn Approval Act. This is a commonsense bill that will prohibit the U.S. Forest Service from authorizing prescribed burns in an area that is labeled an extreme fire danger except under circumstances that have local coordination. Unfortunately, we have seen instances where the Forest Service has acted recklessly by starting prescribed burns under extremely hazardous conditions. The Pautre fire in South Dakota is one such example. Despite the hot and windy conditions and being warned repeatedly from local ranchers and local officials that it was too windy and too dry to be starting a controlled burn, the Forest Service still carried out a prescribed burn that was intended to cover just 130 acres of dead crested wheatgrass. Within hours, the fire escalated out of control. More than 10,000 acres of Forest Service land, grazing association controlled land, and private land was consumed by the wildfire. Millions of dollars of damage was done not only to the land but to fences and families. Families were devastated. Multiple firefighting units and personnel were put in harm's way. This burn should not have occurred that day without the collaboration and additional precautions that such a burn will require. It should happen in consultation with local officials and those who know the land best, those who live on the land and work the land each and every day-- local farmers and ranchers. It only makes sense that the Forest Service has the responsibility to coordinate with local and State fire officials in circumstances where the threat of wildfire is high. This bill is a step in the right direction to make certain that necessary precautions are taken. Furthermore, this bill would add transparency and a degree of accountability to the Forest Service's actions by ensuring that Congress is aware of the prescribed burns that are done under hazardous conditions. I would like to thank Senator Thune for his work on this bill and the chairman for bringing this bill forward. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor. Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. It is worth noting that before there were ever farmers and ranchers on the plains, before Coronado ever came up from the south, or Lewis and Clark crossed through the north, and even before our Native American friends first appeared in North America fire has been an important management tool in the ecosystem of the Great Plains--whether the northern plains where my colleague, Mrs. Noem, lives or the southern plains where I live--an important tool. Maintaining the health of the grasslands, addressing the woody plants that are invasive, this is an important tool. This is why today we rise together to ask for our colleagues to vote for this bill, to provide the ability for everyone who occupies the plains to comfortably work together to use this tool to maintain the health of the Great Plains. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join us in passing the bill. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 3395. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [House] [Pages H7159-H7160] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PRESCRIBED BURN APPROVAL ACT OF 2016 Mr. LUCAS.

The Pautre fire in South Dakota is one such example. Despite the hot and windy conditions and being warned repeatedly from local ranchers and local officials that it was too windy and too dry to be starting a controlled burn, the Forest Service still carried out a prescribed burn that was intended to cover just 130 acres of dead crested wheatgrass. Within hours, the fire escalated out of control. More than 10,000 acres of Forest Service land, grazing association controlled land, and private land was consumed by the wildfire. Millions of dollars of damage was done not only to the land but to fences and families. Families were devastated. Multiple firefighting units and personnel were put in harm's way. This burn should not have occurred that day without the collaboration and additional precautions that such a burn will require. It should happen in consultation with local officials and those who know the land best, those who live on the land and work the land each and every day-- local farmers and ranchers. It only makes sense that the Forest Service has the responsibility to coordinate with local and State fire officials in circumstances where the threat of wildfire is high. This bill is a step in the right direction to make certain that necessary precautions are taken. Furthermore, this bill would add transparency and a degree of accountability to the Forest Service's actions by ensuring that Congress is aware of the prescribed burns that are done under hazardous conditions. I would like to thank Senator Thune for his work on this bill and the chairman for bringing this bill forward. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor. Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. It is worth noting that before there were ever farmers and ranchers on the plains, before Coronado ever came up from the south, or Lewis and Clark crossed through the north, and even before our Native American friends first appeared in North America fire has been an important management tool in the ecosystem of the Great Plains--whether the northern plains where my colleague, Mrs. Noem, lives or the southern plains where I live--an important tool. Maintaining the health of the grasslands, addressing the woody plants that are invasive, this is an important tool. This is why today we rise together to ask for our colleagues to vote for this bill, to provide the ability for everyone who occupies the plains to comfortably work together to use this tool to maintain the health of the Great Plains. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join us in passing the bill. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 3395. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [House] [Pages H7159-H7160] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PRESCRIBED BURN APPROVAL ACT OF 2016 Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 3395) to require limitations on prescribed burns. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: S. 3395 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Prescribed Burn Approval Act of 2016''. SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. In this Act: (1) National fire danger rating system.--The term ``national fire danger rating system'' means the national system used to provide a measure of fire danger according to a range of low to moderate to high to very high to extreme. (2) Prescribed burn.--The term ``prescribed burn'' means a planned fire intentionally ignited. (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the Chief of the Forest Service. SEC. 3. LIMITATIONS ON PRESCRIBED BURNS. (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (b), the Secretary shall not authorize a prescribed burn on Forest Service land if, for the county or contiguous county in which the land is located, the national fire danger rating system indicates an extreme fire danger level. (b) Exception.--The Secretary may authorize a prescribed burn under a condition described in subsection (a) if the Secretary coordinates with the applicable State government and local fire officials. (c) Report.--At the end of each fiscal year, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report describing-- (1) the number and locations of prescribed burns during that fiscal year; and (2) each prescribed burn during that fiscal year that was authorized by the Secretary pursuant to subsection (b). The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Peterson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma. General Leave Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. {time} 1730 Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of S. 3395, the Prescribed Burn Approval Act of 2016. Across much of the country, Forest Service land borders private lands that are essential to the livelihood of farmers, ranchers, and foresters. While the Forest Service is tasked with managing these lands, many techniques are effective but carry risk. On April 3, 2013, the Forest Service conducted a controlled burn on the Dakota Prairie Grasslands intended for 130 acres. As weather conditions changed, the fire escaped its boundary and burned 16,000 acres of private land. The prescribed burn planned by Federal officials resulted in millions of dollars in damage to private lands in South Dakota, with ranchers losing valuable pasture, hay, fence, and structures. In the aftermath of the fire, the Office of the General Counsel of USDA determined that the Forest Service had done nothing out of line and claimed no responsibility to those harmed by this carelessness. This commonsense piece of legislation that we are addressing today, simply put, would require the Forest Service to conduct prescribed burns only when the national fire rating system indicates that it is safe to do so in that county and contiguous counties. Furthermore, this bill will encourage greater collaboration with local officials, helping to mitigate more of the risk to private lands. We all strive to be good neighbors and hope our neighbors will do the same. With passage, this bill gives many neighbors to the Forest Service additional certainty, and I urge your support. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. House of Representatives, Committee on Natural Resources, Washington, DC, December 1, 2016. Hon. K. Michael Conaway, Chairman, Committee on Agriculture, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: I write regarding S. 3395, the Prescribed Burn Approval Act of 2016. This bill contains provisions under the jurisdiction of the Committee on Natural Resources. I recognize and appreciate your desire to bring this bill before the House of Representatives in an expeditious manner, and accordingly, I will agree that the Committee on Natural Resources be discharged from further consideration of the bill. I do so with the understanding that this action does not affect the jurisdiction of the Committee on Natural Resources. I also ask that a copy of this letter and your response be included in the Congressional Record during consideration of S. 3395 on the House floor. Thank you for your work on this important issue, and I look forward to its enactment soon. Sincerely, Rob Bishop, Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources. ____ House of Representatives, Committee on Agriculture, Washington, DC, December 1, 2016. Hon. Rob Bishop, Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Bishop: I am writing concerning S. 3395, the Prescribed Burn Approval Act of 2016. The bill was agreed to in the Senate on November 17, 2016, and was referred in the House primarily to the Committee on Agriculture, with an additional referral to the Committee on Natural Resources. I ask that you allow the Committee on Natural Resources to be discharged from further consideration of the bill so that it may be scheduled by the Majority Leader. This discharge in no way affects your Committee's jurisdiction over the subject matter of [[Page H7160]] the bill, and it will not serve as precedent for future referrals. In addition, should a conference on the bill be necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee on Natural Resources represented on the conference committee. Finally, I would be pleased to include this letter and any response in Congressional Record to memorialize our mutual understanding. Thank you for your consideration and for your continued cooperation between our committees. Sincerely, K. Michael Conaway, Chairman. Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the Prescribed Burn Approval Act of 2016, S. 3395, will help alleviate unintentional disasters when prescribed burns don't go exactly as planned. This is commonsense legislation, and I urge my colleagues to vote in support of it. Prescribed burns are an important tool used by the Forest Service to help manage our national forests and grasslands. However, there is the risk of damage to nearby private property when prescribed burns get out of control, which happened, as was described recently, in the upper Midwest. This bill will allow the Forest Service to continue to use prescribed burns while taking practical steps to prevent disasters. S. 3395 prohibits the Forest Service from utilizing prescribed burns in areas of high fire risk, unless the Forest Service coordinates with State governments and local officials. Having local officials and responders aware of activities can help them be prepared and equipped to assist, if necessary. Frankly, this is something I would hope the Forest Service is already doing, but this bill is a good step. It will make sure that it happens in the future. Again, I urge my colleagues to support the bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from South Dakota (Mrs. Noem), who not only understands these issues but lives these issues. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding to me today. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of S. 3395, the Prescribed Burn Approval Act.

CREC-2016-12-05-pt1-PgH7149,CREC-2016-12-05,114,APOLLO 11 50TH ANNIVERSARY COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [House] [Pages H7149-H7152] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] APOLLO 11 50TH ANNIVERSARY COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT Mr. POSEY. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2726) to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint commemorative coins in recognition of the 50th anniversary of the first manned landing on the Moon, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 2726 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Apollo 11 50th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. The Congress finds the following: (1) On July 16, 1969, the Apollo 11 spacecraft launched from Launch Complex 39A at the John F. Kennedy Space Center carrying Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins, who would become the first of mankind to complete a crewed lunar landing. (2) The United States is the only country ever to have attempted and succeeded in landing humans on a celestial body off the Earth and safely returning them home, completing an unprecedented engineering, scientific and political achievement. (3) The Apollo 11 mission, culminating in man's first steps on the Moon on July 20, 1969, honored the fallen astronauts of the Apollo 1 crew, whose innovative work and bravery will be remembered forever. (4) Apollo 11 accomplished the national goal set forth in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy, who stated at Rice University the following year, ``We choose to go to the Moon. We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win''. (5) At the height of the Cold War, the Apollo space program provided the United States and the free world with a powerful symbolic win, demonstrating the strength, ambition, and determination of the United States in technological and economic advancement, and securing our Nation's leadership in space for generations to come. (6) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (referred to in this Act as ``NASA'') Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, designed, assembled, and tested the most powerful launch vehicle in history, the Saturn V rocket, which was used for the Apollo missions in the 1960s and 1970s. (7) The Saturn V weighed 6,200,000 pounds and generated 7,600,000 pounds of thrust, which NASA has equated to generating more power than 86 Hoover Dams. (8) During the time period from 1969 through 1972, NASA completed eight Apollo missions and landed 12 men on the Moon. The six missions that landed on the Moon returned with a wealth of groundbreaking scientific data and over 800 pounds of lunar samples. (9) An estimated 400,000 Americans contributed to the successful program that led to the lunar landing on July 20, 1969, including NASA scientists, engineers, astronauts, industry contractors and their engineering and manufacturing workforce, as well as the political leadership of Republicans and Democrats in Congress and the White House. (10) The Apollo program, along with its predecessor Mercury and Gemini programs, inspired generations of American students to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), which has fueled innovation and economic growth throughout a range of industries over the last four decades. (11) July 20, 2019, will mark the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the lunar surface. SEC. 3. COIN SPECIFICATIONS. (a) Denominations.--In recognition and celebration of the 50th anniversary of the first manned Moon landing, the Secretary of the Treasury (hereafter in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall mint and issue the following coins: (1) $5 gold coins.--Not more than 50,000 $5 coins, which shall-- (A) weigh 8.359 grams; (B) be struck on a planchet having a diameter of 0.850 inches; and (C) contain not less than 90 percent gold.

(c) Selection and Approval Process for Obverse Design.-- (1) In general.--The Secretary shall hold a juried, compensated competition to determine the design of the common obverse of the coins minted under this Act, with such design being emblematic of the United States space program leading up to the first manned Moon landing. (2) Selection process.--Proposals for the obverse design of coins minted under this Act may be submitted in accordance with the design selection and approval process developed by the Secretary in the sole discretion of the Secretary.

SEC. 5. ISSUANCE OF COINS. (a) Quality of Coins.--Except with respect to coins described under section 3(a)(4), coins minted under this Act shall be issued in uncirculated and proof qualities. (b) Period for Issuance.--The Secretary may issue coins minted under this Act only during the 1-year period beginning on January 1, 2019. SEC. 6. SALE OF COINS.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Posey) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. General Leave Mr. POSEY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. POSEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 2726, the Apollo 11 50th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act, which I introduced, along with my colleague from Florida, Congresswoman Frederica Wilson. This has been a truly bipartisan endeavor, with 298 total cosponsors. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy challenged the Nation with the following words: ``We choose to go to the Moon. We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win. . . . `' That famous speech launched the Apollo program but, more importantly, it galvanized our Nation and united us into accomplishing perhaps the greatest technological achievement in human history, and it was truly a national undertaking. An estimated 400,000 men and women from across the United States contributed to the effort. Components of the Saturn V rocket, command and service module, lunar landing module, and other critical parts were literally manufactured from every State in the Union--from Huntsville, Alabama, to Seal Beach, California; New Orleans, Louisiana, to Cedar Rapids, Iowa; and everywhere in between. On July 16, 1969, a mere 8 years after the first American, Alan Shepard, traveled into space, a Saturn V rocket blasted off from Merritt Island, Florida, and raced to the Moon. Four days later, astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the lunar surface as Michael Collins stood watch. This legislation commemorates our Nation's commitment to space exploration, our pioneering spirit, and our unmatched ingenuity. The United States' leadership in space exploration has benefited our country's national security and economy, strengthened our international relationships, advanced scientific discovery and technology, and vastly improved life here on Earth for practically everyone. American space exploration continues to inspire our next generation of pioneers and innovators. As such, we were deliberate in our efforts to ensure that the sale of these coins would support efforts to grow the next generation of space explorers while also honoring the courage and sacrifice of NASA astronauts lost in the line of duty. This legislation would authorize the minting and sale in 2019 of a limited number of gold, silver, and clad coins in commemoration of the Apollo 11 mission. The coins would be domed, with the reverse featuring a representation of a spacesuit visor similar to the famous Buzz Aldrin on the Moon photograph. After all taxpayer costs are satisfied, surcharges on the sales price of the coins will fund college scholarships for our future scientists, engineers, and astronauts, support educational initiatives that promote space exploration, honor astronauts who have fallen in the line of duty, and memorialize this historical event through a stimulating new museum exhibit. Mr. Speaker, July 20, 2019, will mark the 50th anniversary of the landing of the Eagle lunar module on the Moon's surface. We remain the only country that has ever landed humans on the Moon and returned them safely to Earth. {time} 1645 This commemorative coin will celebrate what I feel is the most awe- inspiring engineering and technological deed of the 20th century. I urge its immediate support. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Washington, DC, December 5, 2016. Hon.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in favor of H.R. 2726, legislation that will authorize the issuance of gold, silver, and clad coins in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the first time in history that mankind successfully completed a crewed lunar landing. The Apollo 11 mission was a momentous occasion in its own right, but it was also a bittersweet achievement, as it also served as a reminder of the first Apollo mission, whose courage we will never forget. I am pleased that, in addition to honoring the Apollo 11 crew, the legislation before us today also recognizes the estimated 400,000 Americans who contributed to make possible the Apollo 11 mission. By calling on the Treasury Department to mint and issue coins in honor of Apollo 11, I hope that we will continue to remind all Americans of the boundlessness of what can be achieved when we set our sights high and, quite literally, aim for the Moon. I also hope the coin minted as part of this legislation will show our young people just how exciting the fields of science, mathematics, and engineering can be and how critical they are to building a brighter future for all. By ensuring that a quarter of the proceeds raised will be made available to the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation to make college scholarships available for students pursuing degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, the legislation before us will make one step towards opening up these fields to our best and brightest. The remaining surcharges associated with the sale of the coins will go towards the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum's Destination Moon exhibit and be provided to the Astronauts Memorial Foundation for maintenance of the memorial and to further educational initiatives. For these reasons, I hope all Members will support the legislation before us. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wilson), who has been a champion for this important legislation. Ms. WILSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my full support for the passage of H.R. 2726, the Apollo 11 50th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act. I want to thank my longtime friend and Florida colleague, Representative Posey, for his outstanding leadership as the sponsor of this bill. I am proud to have worked very closely with him to build bipartisan support for this legislation. I also want to thank Speaker Ryan, Chairman Hensarling, Ranking Member Waters, and the Financial Services Committee for their work to bring this bill to the floor. Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today authorizes the minting and distribution of commemorative coins to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the first manned lunar landing mission, Apollo 11. These coins will honor Apollo 11 crew members, Michael Collins, Buzz Aldrin, and Neil Armstrong; NASA scientists, engineers, and astronauts; and the other 400,000 Americans who made the mission possible. Surcharges from the sale of these coins will further our commitment to promote STEM education, space exploration, and science discovery. It will honor astronauts who lost their lives in service of our country and support the Destination Moon exhibit, which will feature exciting Apollo 11 artifacts. As a former elementary school principal and leading advocate for STEM education, I am very happy that this bill supports college scholarships for future scientists, engineers, and astronauts. Mr. Speaker, the Apollo 11 mission is a testament to our values as Americans. The mission's success reminded the world of our commitment to hard work, determination, and patriotism. When many questioned whether we could rise to the challenge of putting a man on the Moon within a decade, we came together, worked our hardest, and achieved this daunting task in just 8 years. We left the world in awe and wonder. When our astronauts were 4 miles past the designated landing spot and mission control told them that they had just 60 seconds of fuel left before the landing would have to be aborted, they did not panic. With unrelenting resolve, they managed to land on the Moon with only 17 seconds to spare. When Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong planted our flag on the Moon, millions of Americans felt a sense of pride that was exhilarating and inspiring. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds. Ms. WILSON of Florida. As Members of Congress, we should look to Apollo 11 as inspiration as we work to tackle challenges that seem unsurmountable. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in voting for this bipartisan legislation, which has 298 cosponsors and the support of Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins, Apollo 11's two surviving astronauts. Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, basically, I will say that it is an honor for me to support this bill and this legislation. I ask all my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. POSEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, we owe a debt of gratitude to the brave astronauts of the Apollo program, some of whom made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. We are beholden to the hundreds of thousands of men and women who, when challenged to go to the Moon in this decade, accepted the challenge with a passion and a resolve that accomplished that which was thought unachievable. I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member for their leadership and support of this legislation. Of course, finally, I want to express my sincere gratitude to my longtime friend and colleague from Florida, (Ms. Wilson), for her staunch support and tireless efforts to ensure that this remarkable achievement is commemorated. Mr. Speaker, we have one opportunity to celebrate this historical event with a commemorative coin. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. [[Page H7152]] Posey) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2726, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [House] [Pages H7149-H7152] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] APOLLO 11 50TH ANNIVERSARY COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT Mr. POSEY. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2726) to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint commemorative coins in recognition of the 50th anniversary of the first manned landing on the Moon, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 2726 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Apollo 11 50th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. The Congress finds the following: (1) On July 16, 1969, the Apollo 11 spacecraft launched from Launch Complex 39A at the John F. Kennedy Space Center carrying Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins, who would become the first of mankind to complete a crewed lunar landing. (2) The United States is the only country ever to have attempted and succeeded in landing humans on a celestial body off the Earth and safely returning them home, completing an unprecedented engineering, scientific and political achievement. (3) The Apollo 11 mission, culminating in man's first steps on the Moon on July 20, 1969, honored the fallen astronauts of the Apollo 1 crew, whose innovative work and bravery will be remembered forever. (4) Apollo 11 accomplished the national goal set forth in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy, who stated at Rice University the following year, ``We choose to go to the Moon. We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win''. (5) At the height of the Cold War, the Apollo space program provided the United States and the free world with a powerful symbolic win, demonstrating the strength, ambition, and determination of the United States in technological and economic advancement, and securing our Nation's leadership in space for generations to come. (6) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (referred to in this Act as ``NASA'') Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, designed, assembled, and tested the most powerful launch vehicle in history, the Saturn V rocket, which was used for the Apollo missions in the 1960s and 1970s. (7) The Saturn V weighed 6,200,000 pounds and generated 7,600,000 pounds of thrust, which NASA has equated to generating more power than 86 Hoover Dams. (8) During the time period from 1969 through 1972, NASA completed eight Apollo missions and landed 12 men on the Moon. The six missions that landed on the Moon returned with a wealth of groundbreaking scientific data and over 800 pounds of lunar samples. (9) An estimated 400,000 Americans contributed to the successful program that led to the lunar landing on July 20, 1969, including NASA scientists, engineers, astronauts, industry contractors and their engineering and manufacturing workforce, as well as the political leadership of Republicans and Democrats in Congress and the White House. (10) The Apollo program, along with its predecessor Mercury and Gemini programs, inspired generations of American students to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), which has fueled innovation and economic growth throughout a range of industries over the last four decades. (11) July 20, 2019, will mark the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the lunar surface. SEC. 3. COIN SPECIFICATIONS.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in favor of H.R. 2726, legislation that will authorize the issuance of gold, silver, and clad coins in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the first time in history that mankind successfully completed a crewed lunar landing. The Apollo 11 mission was a momentous occasion in its own right, but it was also a bittersweet achievement, as it also served as a reminder of the first Apollo mission, whose courage we will never forget. I am pleased that, in addition to honoring the Apollo 11 crew, the legislation before us today also recognizes the estimated 400,000 Americans who contributed to make possible the Apollo 11 mission. By calling on the Treasury Department to mint and issue coins in honor of Apollo 11, I hope that we will continue to remind all Americans of the boundlessness of what can be achieved when we set our sights high and, quite literally, aim for the Moon. I also hope the coin minted as part of this legislation will show our young people just how exciting the fields of science, mathematics, and engineering can be and how critical they are to building a brighter future for all. By ensuring that a quarter of the proceeds raised will be made available to the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation to make college scholarships available for students pursuing degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, the legislation before us will make one step towards opening up these fields to our best and brightest. The remaining surcharges associated with the sale of the coins will go towards the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum's Destination Moon exhibit and be provided to the Astronauts Memorial Foundation for maintenance of the memorial and to further educational initiatives. For these reasons, I hope all Members will support the legislation before us. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wilson), who has been a champion for this important legislation. Ms. WILSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my full support for the passage of H.R. 2726, the Apollo 11 50th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act. I want to thank my longtime friend and Florida colleague, Representative Posey, for his outstanding leadership as the sponsor of this bill. I am proud to have worked very closely with him to build bipartisan support for this legislation. I also want to thank Speaker Ryan, Chairman Hensarling, Ranking Member Waters, and the Financial Services Committee for their work to bring this bill to the floor. Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today authorizes the minting and distribution of commemorative coins to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the first manned lunar landing mission, Apollo 11. These coins will honor Apollo 11 crew members, Michael Collins, Buzz Aldrin, and Neil Armstrong; NASA scientists, engineers, and astronauts; and the other 400,000 Americans who made the mission possible. Surcharges from the sale of these coins will further our commitment to promote STEM education, space exploration, and science discovery. It will honor astronauts who lost their lives in service of our country and support the Destination Moon exhibit, which will feature exciting Apollo 11 artifacts. As a former elementary school principal and leading advocate for STEM education, I am very happy that this bill supports college scholarships for future scientists, engineers, and astronauts. Mr. Speaker, the Apollo 11 mission is a testament to our values as Americans. The mission's success reminded the world of our commitment to hard work, determination, and patriotism. When many questioned whether we could rise to the challenge of putting a man on the Moon within a decade, we came together, worked our hardest, and achieved this daunting task in just 8 years. We left the world in awe and wonder. When our astronauts were 4 miles past the designated landing spot and mission control told them that they had just 60 seconds of fuel left before the landing would have to be aborted, they did not panic. With unrelenting resolve, they managed to land on the Moon with only 17 seconds to spare. When Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong planted our flag on the Moon, millions of Americans felt a sense of pride that was exhilarating and inspiring. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds. Ms. WILSON of Florida. As Members of Congress, we should look to Apollo 11 as inspiration as we work to tackle challenges that seem unsurmountable. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in voting for this bipartisan legislation, which has 298 cosponsors and the support of Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins, Apollo 11's two surviving astronauts. Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, basically, I will say that it is an honor for me to support this bill and this legislation. I ask all my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. POSEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, we owe a debt of gratitude to the brave astronauts of the Apollo program, some of whom made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. We are beholden to the hundreds of thousands of men and women who, when challenged to go to the Moon in this decade, accepted the challenge with a passion and a resolve that accomplished that which was thought unachievable. I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member for their leadership and support of this legislation. Of course, finally, I want to express my sincere gratitude to my longtime friend and colleague from Florida, (Ms. Wilson), for her staunch support and tireless efforts to ensure that this remarkable achievement is commemorated. Mr. Speaker, we have one opportunity to celebrate this historical event with a commemorative coin. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. [[Page H7152]] Posey) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2726, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [House] [Pages H7149-H7152] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] APOLLO 11 50TH ANNIVERSARY COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT Mr. POSEY. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2726) to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint commemorative coins in recognition of the 50th anniversary of the first manned landing on the Moon, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 2726 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Apollo 11 50th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. The Congress finds the following: (1) On July 16, 1969, the Apollo 11 spacecraft launched from Launch Complex 39A at the John F. Kennedy Space Center carrying Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins, who would become the first of mankind to complete a crewed lunar landing. (2) The United States is the only country ever to have attempted and succeeded in landing humans on a celestial body off the Earth and safely returning them home, completing an unprecedented engineering, scientific and political achievement. (3) The Apollo 11 mission, culminating in man's first steps on the Moon on July 20, 1969, honored the fallen astronauts of the Apollo 1 crew, whose innovative work and bravery will be remembered forever. (4) Apollo 11 accomplished the national goal set forth in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy, who stated at Rice University the following year, ``We choose to go to the Moon. We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win''. (5) At the height of the Cold War, the Apollo space program provided the United States and the free world with a powerful symbolic win, demonstrating the strength, ambition, and determination of the United States in technological and economic advancement, and securing our Nation's leadership in space for generations to come. (6) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (referred to in this Act as ``NASA'') Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, designed, assembled, and tested the most powerful launch vehicle in history, the Saturn V rocket, which was used for the Apollo missions in the 1960s and 1970s. (7) The Saturn V weighed 6,200,000 pounds and generated 7,600,000 pounds of thrust, which NASA has equated to generating more power than 86 Hoover Dams. (8) During the time period from 1969 through 1972, NASA completed eight Apollo missions and landed 12 men on the Moon. The six missions that landed on the Moon returned with a wealth of groundbreaking scientific data and over 800 pounds of lunar samples. (9) An estimated 400,000 Americans contributed to the successful program that led to the lunar landing on July 20, 1969, including NASA scientists, engineers, astronauts, industry contractors and their engineering and manufacturing workforce, as well as the political leadership of Republicans and Democrats in Congress and the White House. (10) The Apollo program, along with its predecessor Mercury and Gemini programs, inspired generations of American students to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), which has fueled innovation and economic growth throughout a range of industries over the last four decades. (11) July 20, 2019, will mark the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the lunar surface. SEC. 3. COIN SPECIFICATIONS.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Posey) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. General Leave Mr. POSEY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. POSEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 2726, the Apollo 11 50th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act, which I introduced, along with my colleague from Florida, Congresswoman Frederica Wilson. This has been a truly bipartisan endeavor, with 298 total cosponsors. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy challenged the Nation with the following words: ``We choose to go to the Moon. We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win. . . . `' That famous speech launched the Apollo program but, more importantly, it galvanized our Nation and united us into accomplishing perhaps the greatest technological achievement in human history, and it was truly a national undertaking. An estimated 400,000 men and women from across the United States contributed to the effort. Components of the Saturn V rocket, command and service module, lunar landing module, and other critical parts were literally manufactured from every State in the Union--from Huntsville, Alabama, to Seal Beach, California; New Orleans, Louisiana, to Cedar Rapids, Iowa; and everywhere in between. On July 16, 1969, a mere 8 years after the first American, Alan Shepard, traveled into space, a Saturn V rocket blasted off from Merritt Island, Florida, and raced to the Moon. Four days later, astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the lunar surface as Michael Collins stood watch. This legislation commemorates our Nation's commitment to space exploration, our pioneering spirit, and our unmatched ingenuity. The United States' leadership in space exploration has benefited our country's national security and economy, strengthened our international relationships, advanced scientific discovery and technology, and vastly improved life here on Earth for practically everyone. American space exploration continues to inspire our next generation of pioneers and innovators. As such, we were deliberate in our efforts to ensure that the sale of these coins would support efforts to grow the next generation of space explorers while also honoring the courage and sacrifice of NASA astronauts lost in the line of duty. This legislation would authorize the minting and sale in 2019 of a limited number of gold, silver, and clad coins in commemoration of the Apollo 11 mission. The coins would be domed, with the reverse featuring a representation of a spacesuit visor similar to the famous Buzz Aldrin on the Moon photograph. After all taxpayer costs are satisfied, surcharges on the sales price of the coins will fund college scholarships for our future scientists, engineers, and astronauts, support educational initiatives that promote space exploration, honor astronauts who have fallen in the line of duty, and memorialize this historical event through a stimulating new museum exhibit. Mr. Speaker, July 20, 2019, will mark the 50th anniversary of the landing of the Eagle lunar module on the Moon's surface. We remain the only country that has ever landed humans on the Moon and returned them safely to Earth. {time} 1645 This commemorative coin will celebrate what I feel is the most awe- inspiring engineering and technological deed of the 20th century. I urge its immediate support. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Washington, DC, December 5, 2016. Hon.

With unrelenting resolve, they managed to land on the Moon with only 17 seconds to spare. When Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong planted our flag on the Moon, millions of Americans felt a sense of pride that was exhilarating and inspiring. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds. Ms. WILSON of Florida. As Members of Congress, we should look to Apollo 11 as inspiration as we work to tackle challenges that seem unsurmountable. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in voting for this bipartisan legislation, which has 298 cosponsors and the support of Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins, Apollo 11's two surviving astronauts. Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, basically, I will say that it is an honor for me to support this bill and this legislation. I ask all my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. POSEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, we owe a debt of gratitude to the brave astronauts of the Apollo program, some of whom made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. We are beholden to the hundreds of thousands of men and women who, when challenged to go to the Moon in this decade, accepted the challenge with a passion and a resolve that accomplished that which was thought unachievable. I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member for their leadership and support of this legislation. Of course, finally, I want to express my sincere gratitude to my longtime friend and colleague from Florida, (Ms. Wilson), for her staunch support and tireless efforts to ensure that this remarkable achievement is commemorated. Mr. Speaker, we have one opportunity to celebrate this historical event with a commemorative coin. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. [[Page H7152]] Posey) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2726, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_212.csv,27065,27065,27135,"[congressional record volume 162, number 174 (monday, december 5, 2016)] [house] [pages h7149-h7152] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] apollo 11 50th anniversary commemorative coin act mr. posey. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 2726) to require the secretary of the treasury to mint commemorative coins in recognition of the 50th anniversary of the first manned landing on the moon, as amended. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 2726 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``apollo 11 50th anniversary commemorative coin act''. sec. 2. findings. the congress finds the following: (1) on july 16, 1969, the apollo 11 spacecraft launched from launch complex 39a at the john f. kennedy space center carrying neil armstrong, buzz aldrin, and michael collins, who would become the first of mankind to complete a crewed lunar landing. (2) the united states is the only country ever to have attempted and succeeded in landing humans on a celestial body off the earth and safely returning them home, completing an unprecedented engineering, scientific and political achievement. (3) the apollo 11 mission, culminating in man's first steps on the moon on july 20, 1969, honored the fallen astronauts of the apollo 1 crew, whose innovative work and bravery will be remembered forever. (4) apollo 11 accomplished the national goal set forth in 1961 by president john f. kennedy, who stated at rice university the following year, ``we choose to go to the moon. we choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win''. (5) at the height of the cold war, the apollo space program provided the united states and the free world with a powerful symbolic win, demonstrating the strength, ambition, and determination of the united states in technological and economic advancement, and securing our nation's leadership in space for generations to come. (6) the national aeronautics and space administration's (referred to in this act as ``nasa'') marshall space flight center in huntsville, alabama, designed, assembled, and tested the most powerful launch vehicle in history, the saturn v rocket, which was used for the apollo missions in the 1960s and 1970s. (7) the saturn v weighed 6,200,000 pounds and generated 7,600,000 pounds of thrust, which nasa has equated to generating more power than 86 hoover dams. (8) during the time period from 1969 through 1972, nasa completed eight apollo missions and landed 12 men on the moon. the six missions that landed on the moon returned with a wealth of groundbreaking scientific data and over 800 pounds of lunar samples. (9) an estimated 400,000 americans contributed to the successful program that led to the lunar landing on july 20, 1969, including nasa scientists, engineers, astronauts, industry contractors and their engineering and manufacturing workforce, as well as the political leadership of republicans and democrats in congress and the white house. (10) the apollo program, along with its predecessor mercury and gemini programs, inspired generations of american students to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (stem), which has fueled innovation and economic growth throughout a range of industries over the last four decades. (11) july 20, 2019, will mark the 50th anniversary of the apollo 11 landing of neil armstrong and buzz aldrin on the lunar surface. sec. 3. coin specifications.

new orleans, louisiana, to cedar rapids, iowa; and everywhere in between. on july 16, 1969, a mere 8 years after the first american, alan shepard, traveled into space, a saturn v rocket blasted off from merritt island, florida, and raced to the moon. four days later, astronauts neil armstrong and buzz aldrin landed on the lunar surface as michael collins stood watch. this legislation commemorates our nation's commitment to space exploration, our pioneering spirit, and our unmatched ingenuity. the united states' leadership in space exploration has benefited our country's national security and economy, strengthened our international relationships, advanced scientific discovery and technology, and vastly improved life here on earth for practically everyone. american space exploration continues to inspire our next generation of pioneers and innovators. as such, we were deliberate in our efforts to ensure that the sale of these coins would support efforts to grow the next generation of space explorers while also honoring the courage and sacrifice of nasa astronauts lost in the line of duty. this legislation would authorize the minting and sale in 2019 of a limited number of gold, silver, and clad coins in commemoration of the apollo 11 mission. the coins would be domed, with the reverse featuring a representation of a spacesuit visor similar to the famous buzz aldrin on the moon photograph. after all taxpayer costs are satisfied, surcharges on the sales price of the coins will fund college scholarships for our future scientists, engineers, and astronauts, support educational initiatives that promote space exploration, honor astronauts who have fallen in the line of duty, and memorialize this historical event through a stimulating new museum exhibit. mr. speaker, july 20, 2019, will mark the 50th anniversary of the landing of the eagle lunar module on the moon's surface. we remain the only country that has ever landed humans on the moon and returned them safely to earth. {time} 1645 this commemorative coin will celebrate what i feel is the most awe- inspiring engineering and technological deed of the 20th century. i urge its immediate support. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. committee on ways and means, house of representatives, washington, dc, december 5, 2016. hon. jeb hensarling, chairman, committee on financial services, washington, dc. dear chairman hensarling: i am writing with respect to h.r. 2726, the ``apollo 11 50th anniversary commemorative coin act.'' this bill contains provisions within the rule x jurisdiction of the committee on ways and means. the committee on ways and means will not seek a sequential referral on h.r. 2726 so that it may proceed expeditiously to the house floor for consideration. this is done with the understanding that the jurisdictional interests of the committee on ways and means over this and similar legislation are in no way diminished or altered. in addition, the committee reserves the right to seek conferees on h.r. 2726 and requests your support when such a request is made. i would appreciate your response confirming this understanding with respect to h.r. 2726 and ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the congressional record during consideration of the bill on the house floor. sincerely, kevin brady, chairman. ____ house of representatives, committee on financial services, washington, dc, december 5, 2016. hon. kevin brady, chairman, committee on ways and means, washington, dc. dear chairman brady: thank you for your december 5th letter regarding h.r. 2726, the ``apollo 11 50th anniversary commemorative coin act.'' i am most appreciative of your decision to forego action on h.r. 2726 so that it may move expeditiously to the house floor. i acknowledge that although you are waiving action on the bill, the committee on ways and means is in no way waiving its jurisdictional interest in this or similar legislation. in addition, if a conference is necessary on this legislation, i will support any request that your committee be represented therein. finally, i shall be pleased to include your letter and this letter on h.r. 2726 in the congressional record during floor consideration of the same. sincerely, jeb hensarling, chairman.

and this letter on h.r. 2726 in the congressional record during floor consideration of the same. sincerely, jeb hensarling, chairman. ms. velazquez. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise to speak in favor of h.r. 2726, legislation that will authorize the issuance of gold, silver, and clad coins in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the first time in history that mankind successfully completed a crewed lunar landing. the apollo 11 mission was a momentous occasion in its own right, but it was also a bittersweet achievement, as it also served as a reminder of the first apollo mission, whose courage we will never forget. i am pleased that, in addition to honoring the apollo 11 crew, the legislation before us today also recognizes the estimated 400,000 americans who contributed to make possible the apollo 11 mission. by calling on the treasury department to mint and issue coins in honor of apollo 11, i hope that we will continue to remind all americans of the boundlessness of what can be achieved when we set our sights high and, quite literally, aim for the moon. i also hope the coin minted as part of this legislation will show our young people just how exciting the fields of science, mathematics, and engineering can be and how critical they are to building a brighter future for all. by ensuring that a quarter of the proceeds raised will be made available to the astronaut scholarship foundation to make college scholarships available for students pursuing degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, the legislation before us will make one step towards opening up these fields to our best and brightest. the remaining surcharges associated with the sale of the coins will go towards the smithsonian institution's national air and space museum's destination moon exhibit and be provided to the astronauts memorial foundation for maintenance of the memorial and to further educational initiatives. for these reasons, i hope all members will support the legislation before us. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from florida (ms. wilson), who has been a champion for this important legislation. ms. wilson of florida. mr. speaker, i rise today to express my full support for the passage of h.r. 2726, the apollo 11 50th anniversary commemorative coin act. i want to thank my longtime friend and florida colleague, representative posey, for his outstanding leadership as the sponsor of this bill. i am proud to have worked very closely with him to build bipartisan support for this legislation. i also want to thank speaker ryan, chairman hensarling, ranking member waters, and the financial services committee for their work to bring this bill to the floor. mr. speaker, the bill before us today authorizes the minting and distribution of commemorative coins to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the first manned lunar landing mission, apollo 11. these coins will honor apollo 11 crew members, michael collins, buzz aldrin, and neil armstrong; nasa scientists, engineers, and astronauts; and the other 400,000 americans who made the mission possible. surcharges from the sale of these coins will further our commitment to promote stem education, space exploration, and science discovery. it will honor astronauts who lost their lives in service of our country and support the destination moon exhibit, which will feature exciting apollo 11 artifacts. as a former elementary school principal and leading advocate for stem education, i am very happy that this bill supports college scholarships for future scientists, engineers, and astronauts. mr. speaker, the apollo 11 mission is a testament to our values as americans. the mission's success reminded the world of our commitment to hard work, determination, and patriotism. when many questioned whether we could rise to the challenge of putting a man on the moon within a decade, we came together, worked our hardest, and achieved this daunting task in just 8 years. we left the world in awe and wonder. when our astronauts were 4 miles past the designated landing spot and mission control told them that they had just 60 seconds of fuel left before the landing would have to be aborted, they did not panic. with unrelenting resolve, they managed to land on the moon with only 17 seconds to spare. when buzz aldrin and neil armstrong planted our flag on the moon, millions of americans felt a sense of pride that was exhilarating and inspiring. the speaker pro tempore. the time of the gentlewoman has expired. ms.

In the Senate, it has been Senators McCaskill and Ron Johnson who have worked arm in arm on this and are also very supportive of it. Today we bring up the Senate version of this bill to expedite its approval to get this bill to the President's desk. As you know, Mr. Speaker, whistleblowers are invaluable to the oversight work of Congress. We rely on people who are on the front lines seeing things as they truly are to provide information and blow the whistle when they see something going awry. They are one of our best sources of information about waste, fraud, and abuse within the Federal Government. As an institution, we should try to do everything we can to encourage them to come and speak with us, and when they do, to make sure that they have the proper and adequate protections. That is exactly what this bill does, by recognizing that not all whistleblowers are Federal employees. We have robust Federal recognition and whistleblower protection for Federal employees, and we believe that contractors and others should have that as well. It makes permanent a successful pilot program that extended whistleblower protections to civilian contractor and grantee employees. It also ensures whistleblower protections are extended to subgrantees and personal services contractors for both defense and civilian contractors. It is important because the Federal Government [[Page H7148]] spends half a trillion dollars a year on grants and contracts. Think about that; half a trillion dollars is going out the door. There is always somebody doing something stupid somewhere; so to have this protection for a whistleblower as a contractor, for instance, just seems wise and prudent. In overseeing how these funds are spent, the best source for rooting out waste is from grantees, subgrantees, contractors, and subcontractors. One loophole this bill closes is that personal services contractors were not protected in the past. These contractors can be just as valuable in identifying the waste and fraud we are committed to preventing in the first place. It only makes sense to offer those personal services contractors the same protections we give other contractors. With this bill, we are sending a strong message to both whistleblowers and their employers. We are serious about stopping waste, fraud, and abuse, and we are serious about protecting those who bring that information forward. Every dollar of wasted funds comes from the pocket of the same hardworking men and women who elected us to Congress. It is their money. It is not our money. It is not the Federal Government's money. It is the taxpayers' money. As we work to protect these taxpayer dollars, we also have a duty and responsibility to protect these whistleblowers. They are the best allies we have. S. 795 accomplishes that goal. An identical bill was passed out of our committee. I would appreciate the support of our colleagues to further this. Again, I thank Mr. Cummings for his good work and passion on this. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 795. I introduced the House companion of this legislation, the Whistleblower Protections for Contractors Act. We are taking up the Senate measure today to make sure this bill can be signed by the President before the end of this Congress. I want to thank Senator McCaskill for all of her hard work and Senator Johnson for all that he did to make this bill come to this point. I would also like to give special thanks to Chairman Chaffetz for being an original cosponsor and helping bring this bill to the floor. Our committee has always stood hand in hand with regard to protecting whistleblowers, and we have made it abundantly clear that we will do everything in our power to protect them from any type of retaliation or any type of harm. Whistleblowers are the front line of defense against waste, fraud, and abuse. Employees who work on Federal contracts and grants see firsthand when taxpayer money is being wasted. They risk their careers to challenge abuses of power and mismanagement of government resources. They must be protected against retaliation when they blow the whistle on wrongdoing. Just the other day, we had a witness come before our committee, and it was clear that she was very, very concerned about retaliation to the point of almost being shaken. You could actually see it. When we see these folks, we realize and we are reminded of the fact that they bring a very important resource to us as the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and that is they bring us information, information that allows us to be able to address problems that we wouldn't even know about if it were not for them. I thank Chairman Chaffetz and our entire committee for taking the attitude of protecting whistleblowers to the greatest extent we possibly can. This bill would ensure that more employees are protected by giving subgrantees and personal services contractors the same whistleblower protections currently given to contractors, grant recipients, and subcontractors. This bill also would make protections for civilian contractors and grantees permanent. These are protections that contractors and grantees of the Department of Defense already enjoy. I urge every Member of Congress to stand up for whistleblowers, to stand up for good government, and to pass this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to vote in favor of this very important and meaningful legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 795, a bill to enhance whistleblower protection for contractor and grantee employees. The Government Accountability Project, a leading U.S. organization in support of Federal whistleblower laws, supports without qualifications S. 795, legislation to make permanent a pilot program that provides whistleblower rights for employees of government contractors. The ``Pilot program for enhancement of contractor protection from reprisal for disclosure of certain information'' (pilot program) was established under 41 U.S.C. Sec. 4712, as an amendment to the FY2012 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Federal whistleblower protection laws are not new; they provide a means for government employees to report waste, fraud, and abuse of taxpayer resources. I support this bill because the bill extends federal contractor whistleblower protections to employees of: (1) personal services contractors working on defense contracts (currently, the protections apply to employees of defense contractors, subcontractors, grantees, or sub-grantees); and (2) personal services contractors or sub-grantees working on federal civilian contracts (currently, the protections apply to employees of civilian contractors, subcontractors, or grantees). This bill would codify a pilot program that is already in place that allows employees of civilian contractors to report waste, fraud, and abuse and make permanent the civilian contractor protections. S. 795 extends whistleblower protections to employees of subcontractors to report waste, fraud and abuse of federal taxpayer dollars. Whistleblower disclosures by Federal contract employees can save lives as well as billions of taxpayer dollars. For example, Section 1553 of the Obama Administration's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) established whistleblower protections for all recipients of stimulus funds, including all state and local government employees and all contractors, including within the IC. That provision was credited with the low rate of fraud reported around stimulus funds. During the Congressional oversight hearings, the Chair of the Legislation Committee of the Council of Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE) testified that: OIGs indicated that their investigations and reviews of the whistleblower complaints had resulted in recovery of approximately $1.85 million as of April of the first year it was in force. One of the key provisions of ARRA is Section 1553 that gives the authority of OIGs to investigate reprisal complaints from non-Federal employee whistleblowers. Federal whistleblower protection laws play a critical role in keeping our Government honest, efficient, and accountable by rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse as well as protecting public health and safety. Whistleblowers can be some of the most powerful tools in the federal government arsenal to protect taxpayer dollars. For example, the Securities and Exchange Commission finds of great assistance information from whistleblowers who know of possible securities law violations that could be among the most powerful weapons in the law enforcement arsenal of the Securities and Exchange Commission. According to USASpending.gov, in Fiscal Year 2015, the Federal government spent over $1 trillion in contracts and grants--$438 billion in contracts and $614 billion in grants. If this bill does not pass, contractors and grantees are in danger of losing hard-fought whistleblower protections if current protections are not extended. This bill makes those protections permanent, ensuring that contractors and grantees continue to have the security they need to report waste, fraud and abuse of taxpayer dollars. Much of this funding flows through the prime contractors and grantees to subcontractors and sub-grantees. The bill applies to subcontractors' existing prohibitions on reimbursable costs for contractors, including in their defense against retaliation claims by whistleblowers. Federal taxpayers should not foot the legal bills for contractors who retaliate against employees that report waste, fraud and abuse of taxpayer dollars. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 795. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. [[Page H7149]] A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [House] [Pages H7147-H7149] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ENHANCING WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION FOR CONTRACTOR AND GRANTEE EMPLOYEES Mr. CHAFFETZ.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah. General Leave Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. Mr. CHAFFETZ. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this bill, S. 795, a bill to enhance whistleblower protection for contractor and grantee employees. It is a bill with good bipartisan support in both Chambers of Congress. I really do applaud and thank, in particular, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings), the ranking member on our committee, who has helped champion this and point this out and lead our efforts in the House on this. In the House, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform considered an identical bill, the Whistleblower Protections for Contractors Act, introduced by Ranking Member Cummings and myself, and the committee reported this legislation by unanimous consent. In the Senate, it has been Senators McCaskill and Ron Johnson who have worked arm in arm on this and are also very supportive of it.

For example, Section 1553 of the Obama Administration's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) established whistleblower protections for all recipients of stimulus funds, including all state and local government employees and all contractors, including within the IC. That provision was credited with the low rate of fraud reported around stimulus funds. During the Congressional oversight hearings, the Chair of the Legislation Committee of the Council of Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE) testified that: OIGs indicated that their investigations and reviews of the whistleblower complaints had resulted in recovery of approximately $1.85 million as of April of the first year it was in force. One of the key provisions of ARRA is Section 1553 that gives the authority of OIGs to investigate reprisal complaints from non-Federal employee whistleblowers. Federal whistleblower protection laws play a critical role in keeping our Government honest, efficient, and accountable by rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse as well as protecting public health and safety. Whistleblowers can be some of the most powerful tools in the federal government arsenal to protect taxpayer dollars. For example, the Securities and Exchange Commission finds of great assistance information from whistleblowers who know of possible securities law violations that could be among the most powerful weapons in the law enforcement arsenal of the Securities and Exchange Commission. According to USASpending.gov, in Fiscal Year 2015, the Federal government spent over $1 trillion in contracts and grants--$438 billion in contracts and $614 billion in grants. If this bill does not pass, contractors and grantees are in danger of losing hard-fought whistleblower protections if current protections are not extended. This bill makes those protections permanent, ensuring that contractors and grantees continue to have the security they need to report waste, fraud and abuse of taxpayer dollars. Much of this funding flows through the prime contractors and grantees to subcontractors and sub-grantees. The bill applies to subcontractors' existing prohibitions on reimbursable costs for contractors, including in their defense against retaliation claims by whistleblowers. Federal taxpayers should not foot the legal bills for contractors who retaliate against employees that report waste, fraud and abuse of taxpayer dollars. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 795. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed.

126 stat. 1833). the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from utah (mr. chaffetz) and the gentleman from maryland (mr. cummings) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from utah. general leave mr. chaffetz. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from utah? there was no objection. mr. chaffetz. i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of this bill, s. 795, a bill to enhance whistleblower protection for contractor and grantee employees. it is a bill with good bipartisan support in both chambers of congress. i really do applaud and thank, in particular, the gentleman from maryland (mr. cummings), the ranking member on our committee, who has helped champion this and point this out and lead our efforts in the house on this. in the house, the committee on oversight and government reform considered an identical bill, the whistleblower protections for contractors act, introduced by ranking member cummings and myself, and the committee reported this legislation by unanimous consent. in the senate, it has been senators mccaskill and ron johnson who have worked arm in arm on this and are also very supportive of it. today we bring up the senate version of this bill to expedite its approval to get this bill to the president's desk. as you know, mr. speaker, whistleblowers are invaluable to the oversight work of congress. we rely on people who are on the front lines seeing things as they truly are to provide information and blow the whistle when they see something going awry. they are one of our best sources of information about waste, fraud, and abuse within the federal government. as an institution, we should try to do everything we can to encourage them to come and speak with us, and when they do, to make sure that they have the proper and adequate protections. that is exactly what this bill does, by recognizing that not all whistleblowers are federal employees. we have robust federal recognition and whistleblower protection for federal employees, and we believe that contractors and others should have that as well. it makes permanent a successful pilot program that extended whistleblower protections to civilian contractor and grantee employees. it also ensures whistleblower protections are extended to subgrantees and personal services contractors for both defense and civilian contractors. it is important because the federal government [[page h7148]] spends half a trillion dollars a year on grants and contracts. think about that; half a trillion dollars is going out the door. there is always somebody doing something stupid somewhere; so to have this protection for a whistleblower as a contractor, for instance, just seems wise and prudent. in overseeing how these funds are spent, the best source for rooting out waste is from grantees, subgrantees, contractors, and subcontractors. one loophole this bill closes is that personal services contractors were not protected in the past. these contractors can be just as valuable in identifying the waste and fraud we are committed to preventing in the first place. it only makes sense to offer those personal services contractors the same protections we give other contractors. with this bill, we are sending a strong message to both whistleblowers and their employers. we are serious about stopping waste, fraud, and abuse, and we are serious about protecting those who bring that information forward. every dollar of wasted funds comes from the pocket of the same hardworking men and women who elected us to congress. it is their money. it is not our money. it is not the federal government's money. it is the taxpayers' money. as we work to protect these taxpayer dollars, we also have a duty and responsibility to protect these whistleblowers. they are the best allies we have. s. 795 accomplishes that goal. an identical bill was passed out of our committee. i would appreciate the support of our colleagues to further this. again, i thank mr. cummings for his good work and passion on this. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. cummings. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise in strong support of s. 795. i introduced the house companion of this legislation, the whistleblower protections for contractors act. we are taking up the senate measure today to make sure this bill can be signed by the president before the end of this congress. i want to thank senator mccaskill for all of her hard work and senator johnson for all that he did to make this bill come to this point. i would also like to give special thanks to chairman chaffetz for being an original cosponsor and helping bring this bill to the floor. our committee has always stood hand in hand with regard to protecting whistleblowers, and we have made it abundantly clear that we will do everything in our power to protect them from any type of retaliation or any type of harm. whistleblowers are the front line of defense against waste, fraud, and abuse. employees who work on federal contracts and grants see firsthand when taxpayer money is being wasted. they risk their careers to challenge abuses of power and mismanagement of government resources. they must be protected against retaliation when they blow the whistle on wrongdoing. just the other day, we had a witness come before our committee, and it was clear that she was very, very concerned about retaliation to the point of almost being shaken. you could actually see it. when we see these folks, we realize and we are reminded of the fact that they bring a very important resource to us as the committee on oversight and government reform, and that is they bring us information, information that allows us to be able to address problems that we wouldn't even know about if it were not for them. i thank chairman chaffetz and our entire committee for taking the attitude of protecting whistleblowers to the greatest extent we possibly can. this bill would ensure that more employees are protected by giving subgrantees and personal services contractors the same whistleblower protections currently given to contractors, grant recipients, and subcontractors. this bill also would make protections for civilian contractors and grantees permanent. these are protections that contractors and grantees of the department of defense already enjoy. i urge every member of congress to stand up for whistleblowers, to stand up for good government, and to pass this legislation. mr. speaker, i urge all members to vote in favor of this very important and meaningful legislation. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. chaffetz. mr. speaker, i urge adoption. i yield back the balance of my time. ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, i rise in support of s. 795, a bill to enhance whistleblower protection for contractor and grantee employees. the government accountability project, a leading u.s. organization in support of federal whistleblower laws, supports without qualifications s. 795, legislation to make permanent a pilot program that provides whistleblower rights for employees of government contractors. the ``pilot program for enhancement of contractor protection from reprisal for disclosure of certain information'' (pilot program) was established under 41 u.s.c. sec. 4712, as an amendment to the fy2012 national defense authorization act (ndaa). federal whistleblower protection laws are not new; they provide a means for government employees to report waste, fraud, and abuse of taxpayer resources. i support this bill because the bill extends federal contractor whistleblower protections to employees of: (1) personal services contractors working on defense contracts (currently, the protections apply to employees of defense contractors, subcontractors, grantees, or sub-grantees); and (2) personal services contractors or sub-grantees working on federal civilian contracts (currently, the protections apply to employees of civilian contractors, subcontractors, or grantees). this bill would codify a pilot program that is already in place that allows employees of civilian contractors to report waste, fraud, and abuse and make permanent the civilian contractor protections. s. 795 extends whistleblower protections to employees of subcontractors to report waste, fraud and abuse of federal taxpayer dollars. whistleblower disclosures by federal contract employees can save lives as well as billions of taxpayer dollars. for example, section 1553 of the obama administration's american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 (arra) established whistleblower protections for all recipients of stimulus funds, including all state and local government employees and all contractors, including within the ic. that provision was credited with the low rate of fraud reported around stimulus funds. during the congressional oversight hearings, the chair of the legislation committee of the council of inspectors general on integrity and efficiency (cigie) testified that: oigs indicated that their investigations and reviews of the whistleblower complaints had resulted in recovery of approximately $1.85 million as of april of the first year it was in force. one of the key provisions of arra is section 1553 that gives the authority of oigs to investigate reprisal complaints from non-federal employee whistleblowers. federal whistleblower protection laws play a critical role in keeping our government honest, efficient, and accountable by rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse as well as protecting public health and safety. whistleblowers can be some of the most powerful tools in the federal government arsenal to protect taxpayer dollars. for example, the securities and exchange commission finds of great assistance information from whistleblowers who know of possible securities law violations that could be among the most powerful weapons in the law enforcement arsenal of the securities and exchange commission. according to usaspending.gov, in fiscal year 2015, the federal government spent over $1 trillion in contracts and grants--$438 billion in contracts and $614 billion in grants. if this bill does not pass, contractors and grantees are in danger of losing hard-fought whistleblower protections if current protections are not extended. this bill makes those protections permanent, ensuring that contractors and grantees continue to have the security they need to report waste, fraud and abuse of taxpayer dollars. much of this funding flows through the prime contractors and grantees to subcontractors and sub-grantees. the bill applies to subcontractors' existing prohibitions on reimbursable costs for contractors, including in their defense against retaliation claims by whistleblowers. federal taxpayers should not foot the legal bills for contractors who retaliate against employees that report waste, fraud and abuse of taxpayer dollars. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from utah (mr. chaffetz) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, s. 795. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed.

CREC-2016-12-05-pt1-PgH7156,CREC-2016-12-05,114,COMBAT-INJURED VETERANS TAX FAIRNESS ACT OF 2016,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [House] [Pages H7156-H7159] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 1715 COMBAT-INJURED VETERANS TAX FAIRNESS ACT OF 2016 Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 5015) to restore amounts improperly withheld for tax purposes from severance payments to individuals who retired or separated from service in the Armed Forces for combat-related injuries, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 5015 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

(3) Congress has recognized the tremendous personal sacrifice of veterans with combat-related injuries by, among other things, specifically excluding from taxable income severance pay received for combat-related injuries. (4) Since 1991, the Secretary of Defense has improperly withheld taxes from severance pay for wounded veterans, thus denying them their due compensation and a significant benefit intended by Congress. (5) Many veterans owed redress are beyond the statutory period to file an amended tax return because they were not or are not aware that taxes were improperly withheld. SEC. 3. RESTORATION OF AMOUNTS IMPROPERLY WITHHELD FOR TAX PURPOSES FROM SEVERANCE PAYMENTS TO VETERANS WITH COMBAT-RELATED INJURIES. (a) In General.--Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall-- (1) identify-- (A) the severance payments-- (i) that the Secretary paid after January 17, 1991; (ii) that the Secretary computed under section 1212 of title 10, United States Code; (iii) that were not considered gross income pursuant to section 104(a)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; and (iv) from which the Secretary withheld amounts for tax purposes; and (B) the individuals to whom such severance payments were made; and (2) with respect to each person identified under paragraph (1)(B), provide-- (A) notice of-- (i) the amount of severance payments in paragraph (1)(A) which were improperly withheld for tax purposes; and (ii) such other information determined to be necessary by the Secretary of the Treasury to carry out the purposes of this section; and (B) instructions for filing amended tax returns to recover the amounts improperly withheld for tax purposes.

The allowable amount of credit or refund of a specified overpayment shall be determined without regard to the amount of tax paid within the period provided in section 6511(b)(2). (2) Specified overpayment.--For purposes of paragraph (1), the term ``specified overpayment'' means an overpayment attributable to a severance payment described in subsection (a)(1). SEC. 4. REQUIREMENT THAT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ENSURE AMOUNTS ARE NOT WITHHELD FOR TAX PURPOSES FROM SEVERANCE PAYMENTS NOT CONSIDERED GROSS INCOME. The Secretary of Defense shall take such actions as may be necessary to ensure that amounts are not withheld for tax purposes from severance payments made by the Secretary to individuals when such payments are not considered gross income pursuant to section 104(a)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. SEC. 5. REPORT TO CONGRESS. (a) In General.--After completing the identification required by section 3(a) and not later than one year after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a report on the actions taken by the Secretary to carry out this Act.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Neal) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. General Leave Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 5015, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, we have responsibilities for all the brave men and women who protect and defend our great Nation, especially those who are injured in the line of duty. The bill we are considering today by Representative Rouzer does just that. Under our tax system, veterans who suffer from combat-related injuries are not required to pay taxes on the one-time lump-sum disability payment they receive when they leave the military. Unfortunately, errors in the Defense Department's automatic payment system have resulted in taxes being improperly withheld from these injured troops' payments--sometimes for years on end. As a result, thousands of combat-injured veterans--men and women who have sacrificed greatly for our country--have not received the full compensation they are rightfully due. The Combat-Injured Veterans Tax Fairness Act provides an opportunity to right this wrong for veterans injured during their service. This legislation will allow veterans to recover income taxes that were improperly collected by the Department of Defense on certain disability severance payments. Under this bill, the Defense Department will be required to identify all the veterans who have been impacted by this problem. They will inform these veterans of the full amount that has been improperly withheld from their disability payments, and they will provide detailed instructions on how veterans can recover the money through an amended tax return. Our men and women in uniform and their families have sacrificed so much for our Nation. Errors like this are completely unacceptable and cannot be allowed to go unaddressed. I thank Representative Rouzer for his leadership on the Combat- Injured Veterans Tax Fairness Act and his dedication. This legislation takes important action to ensure America's promises are kept to our combat-injured heroes and their families. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting its passage. I reserve the balance of my time. Committee on Armed Services, House of Representatives, Washington, DC, November 30, 2016. Hon. Kevin Brady, Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: I write concerning H.R. 5015, the Combat-Injured Veterans Tax Fairness Act of 2016, which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker. In order to expedite this legislation for floor consideration, the Committee on Armed Services will forgo action on this bill. This decision is conditional on our mutual understanding that forgoing consideration in no way diminishes or alters the jurisdictional interests of the Committee on Armed Services in this bill, any subsequent amendments, or similar legislation. Please place a copy of this letter and your response acknowledging our jurisdictional interest into the Congressional Record during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Sincerely, William M. ``Mac'' Thornberry, Chairman. ____ Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Washington, DC, December 1, 2016. Hon. William M. ``Mac'' Thornberry, Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Thornberry: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 5015, the ``Combat-Injured Veterans Tax Fairness Act of 2016.'' As you noted, the bill was referred to the Committee on Armed Services. I am most appreciative of your decision to waive formal consideration of H.R. 5015 so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor. I acknowledge that although you waived formal consideration of the bill, the Committee on Armed Services is in no way waiving its jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in those provisions of the bill that fall within your Rule X jurisdiction. I will include a copy of our letters in the Congressional Record during consideration of this legislation on the House floor. Sincerely, Kevin Brady, Chairman. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Brady for his efforts on behalf of this legislation. This is a pleasant responsibility that we have when you consider that its corrective action will alone help 175 former military members in the State of Massachusetts and 13,800 across the country. Let me reiterate some of the points that were made by Chairman Brady. The bill before us corrects an issue related to a provision that was designed to alleviate some of the tax burdens of our Nation's combat- injured veterans. Under Federal law, veterans who suffer combat-related injuries and who are separated from the military are not supposed to be taxed on the one-time lump-sum disability severance payment they receive from the Department of Defense. Due to an accounting error at the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, approximately $78 million in tax payments were inadvertently taken from combat-disabled servicemembers. Some of this improper withholding has taken place outside the 3-year period in which taxpayers could file an amended tax return. H.R. 5015 would right this wrong by instructing DOD to identify those who were wrongfully taxed so that they can be reimbursed. This bill would allow those veterans identified by the DOD to file amended returns to recoup those unintentionally withheld funds. Mr. Speaker, I am curious with respect to two items in this bill, and I just would like to raise this ever so politely with the majority party. Veterans' issues in the Congress have long had a bipartisan flavor to them. We have been supportive across the board in the efforts that we make as it relates to our veterans, and the differences we have generally are very small; but in this case, it does not appear that a Democrat was asked to cosponsor the bill in its original introduction. So I would hope in the future that even though this bill was largely [[Page H7158]] sponsored by Republican Members, that on this side you could have easily picked up 33 Members as well. So I hope going forward there will be that effort that we would continue with here to ensure that matters of this magnitude are well met by both parties. I would say that I don't want to suggest for a moment that this was done in a partisan atmosphere as much as I would like to think that it was just overlooked. I hope in the future that we would be considered for sponsorship of this sort of legislation as well. Also, I would like to highlight an issue that is akin to the matter that is before us, and it comes from our friends on the committee, Sam Johnson and John Larson. They worked together on legislation that would prevent exonerated felons from facing an undue tax burden with respect to payments they received due to their wrongful conviction--emphasis on ``wrongful conviction.'' Similar to the veterans in the situation before us, these wrongfully convicted individuals should not face an improper tax liability on amounts intended to compensate for the tremendous injustices they faced under our legal system. Legislation to that effect became law in 2015. However, due to the lengthy IRS process in providing guidance on the issue, the statute would only allow less than 5 months for these exonerated individuals to amend their prior year tax returns. Mr. Johnson and Mr. Larson of Connecticut have worked tirelessly to make sure that these individuals are not unfairly burdened further than they already have been and they have proposed extending the statutory deadline for these individuals to file amended returns. So while I think the legislation before us is sound, I do hope that the committee and the Congress will find time to consider similar IRS filing-deadline legislation with respect to these exonerated individuals. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Rouzer), who is the author of the bill in the House. Besides his advocacy for small businesses and job growth, he is also a champion for our military, especially those who have been injured in combat. Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, first, I want to make mention to the fine ranking member of the committee that we did reach out, certainly, to as many staff on the Democrat side as we possibly could. Perhaps we could have done a little bit better job of that, but I do want to make mention that we did make that effort--a point duly noted, though--and we will follow up multiple times the next time I have a bill that I think the gentleman would be interested in. Mr. Speaker, I filed H.R. 5015, the Combat-Injured Veterans Tax Fairness Act, after learning that nearly 14,000 veterans from all 50 States and the District of Columbia who suffered service-ending, combat-related injuries never received the full amount of their severance payment because taxes were wrongly withheld. Let me repeat that: nearly 14,000 veterans did not receive the money to which they were entitled because of a taxing error made by the Federal Government. Now, in case you are wondering how this error occurred, here is some background: the Internal Revenue Code excludes recurring disability payments from taxable income for personal injuries or sickness resulting from active service in our Armed Forces. In 1991, a Federal district court case, St. Clair v. United States, determined that one- time lump-sum disability severance payments received for injuries resulting from active service should be excluded from taxable income as well. Despite this court decision and the resulting regulatory guidance that stemmed from it, taxes on combat-related disability severance payments have been withheld for many years. As was mentioned earlier, the Defense Finance and Accounting System claimed this was due to the limitations of its automated computer payment system. Go figure. Regardless, this is an issue that needs to be addressed. Many of the veterans affected are not even aware that their benefits were improperly reduced. In most cases, the 3-year period in which they could file an amended tax return to get their money back has long since passed. This legislation directs the Department of Defense to identify instances of improper withholding and determine how much these combat- wounded veterans are owed. Those veterans who were adversely affected will then be able to apply to the IRS to receive the money they are rightfully due. Our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines risk their lives every day to protect our freedoms, our values, and our Republic. The revelation that there are thousands of veterans who did not receive their full disability severance pay is unacceptable, and it must be corrected immediately. Today we can make a great step towards rectifying this problem. I think we can all agree that these veterans deserve no less for their service and sacrifice to our Nation. I want to make special mention of Senator Boozman of Arkansas and Senator Warner of Virginia who have sponsored an identical bill in the United States Senate. Their leadership on this issue has been absolutely critical. I commend this legislation to my colleagues and encourage its passage. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I want to acknowledge the gentleman for his good effort and his thoughtful response to the point that I raised. Of course, thanks to Chairman Brady, this is an example, again, in a small way of how we can do some good things around here in a bipartisan manner. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. First, I really do applaud the work of Representative Rouzer in this area and the bipartisan work of Senators Boozman and Warner. This is an area that could have easily been just swept aside over the years and never really addressed. The gentleman continued to raise the issue, bring it to our attention, and work through the legislative process. Again, I thank the gentleman for his very important leadership. I also thank the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Chairman Mac Thornberry, and his team for their approval of this measure and willingness to work with the author to bring this forward. I, too, thank the ranking member, Mr. Neal, and congratulate him on his naming as ranking member for the Ways and Means Committee. I look forward to working with the gentleman on these and other issues moving forward. On behalf of 14,000 veterans who deserve to get the dollars they earned from the Department of Defense, late is better than never. I applaud the efforts of Mr. Rouzer in doing that. Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this bipartisan bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5015, Combat- Injured Veterans Tax Fairness Act of 2016, because the legislation directs the Defense Department (DoD) to restore improperly withheld for taxes from severance payments to individuals who retired or separated from service in the Armed Forces for combat-related injuries. The bill also requires the DoD to notify combat-injured veterans if it had improperly withheld tax on their severance pay any time after January 17, 1991 and provide the veterans with information on how to seek a refund from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). H.R. 5015 works to remedy the egregious action of withholding more than $78 million in taxes from almost 14,000 combat-injured veterans. This legislation additionally ensures that further tax amounts will not be taken from combat-injured veterans in the future. As a member of the House Committee on Homeland Security since its establishment, and current Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Security this bill is of importance to me. The DoD held an average of over $5,500 from each of the veterans since 1991. That amount of money could help combat-injured veterans with hospital bills and the difficult transition back into civilian life. I am pleased that the DoD will also have to submit a report on the number [[Page H7159]] of times it had withheld pay to combat-injured veterans, the amount of each severance payment it withheld, and its actions to prevent future improper withholding to Congress within one year of the bill's enactment for Congress to assess the situation. Our veterans deserve to be treated with respect. It is only through the efforts and sacrifice of our veterans that America has the freedoms and privileges we do today. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 5015. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5015, a bill that would improve the fairness of the tax code and treat our service members with the respect they are due. Veterans who suffered combat-related injuries who separated from the military are not supposed to be taxed on any one-time disability payments. Unfortunately, an accounting error has cost about 14,000 veterans more than $78 million in taxes. Just under 500 of these veterans are from my home state of Illinois. H.R. 5015 fixes this problem by instructing the DoD to identify those who were wrongfully taxed so that they can be reimbursed. The lion's share of the affected veterans are outside of the window for amending their tax returns to recoup the funds. Consequently, this bill would allow those veterans identified by the DoD to file amended returns to recoup these unintentionally-withheld funds. This is a good bill that helps our service members as we should. I hope that this chamber can engage in similar bipartisan efforts to support other needy Americans as we move into the next Congress. I am troubled that some stakeholders are advocating that a 15 to 20 percent corporate tax rate serve as the central metric by which we judge any tax reform effort. To achieve this rate, middle- and low- income families and small businesses will have to subsidize the wealthiest corporations, foregoing critical credits and deductions that provide much needed assistance. I sincerely hope that we advance the intent of this bill to help Americans in need as we consider tax reform next year. I strongly support H.R. 5015, and I urge my colleagues to support its passage. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5015, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [House] [Pages H7156-H7159] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 1715 COMBAT-INJURED VETERANS TAX FAIRNESS ACT OF 2016 Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 5015) to restore amounts improperly withheld for tax purposes from severance payments to individuals who retired or separated from service in the Armed Forces for combat-related injuries, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill.

(4) Since 1991, the Secretary of Defense has improperly withheld taxes from severance pay for wounded veterans, thus denying them their due compensation and a significant benefit intended by Congress. (5) Many veterans owed redress are beyond the statutory period to file an amended tax return because they were not or are not aware that taxes were improperly withheld. SEC. 3.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Neal) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. General Leave Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 5015, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, we have responsibilities for all the brave men and women who protect and defend our great Nation, especially those who are injured in the line of duty. The bill we are considering today by Representative Rouzer does just that. Under our tax system, veterans who suffer from combat-related injuries are not required to pay taxes on the one-time lump-sum disability payment they receive when they leave the military. Unfortunately, errors in the Defense Department's automatic payment system have resulted in taxes being improperly withheld from these injured troops' payments--sometimes for years on end. As a result, thousands of combat-injured veterans--men and women who have sacrificed greatly for our country--have not received the full compensation they are rightfully due. The Combat-Injured Veterans Tax Fairness Act provides an opportunity to right this wrong for veterans injured during their service. This legislation will allow veterans to recover income taxes that were improperly collected by the Department of Defense on certain disability severance payments. Under this bill, the Defense Department will be required to identify all the veterans who have been impacted by this problem. They will inform these veterans of the full amount that has been improperly withheld from their disability payments, and they will provide detailed instructions on how veterans can recover the money through an amended tax return. Our men and women in uniform and their families have sacrificed so much for our Nation. Errors like this are completely unacceptable and cannot be allowed to go unaddressed. I thank Representative Rouzer for his leadership on the Combat- Injured Veterans Tax Fairness Act and his dedication. This legislation takes important action to ensure America's promises are kept to our combat-injured heroes and their families. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting its passage. I reserve the balance of my time. Committee on Armed Services, House of Representatives, Washington, DC, November 30, 2016. Hon. Kevin Brady, Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: I write concerning H.R. 5015, the Combat-Injured Veterans Tax Fairness Act of 2016, which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker. In order to expedite this legislation for floor consideration, the Committee on Armed Services will forgo action on this bill. This decision is conditional on our mutual understanding that forgoing consideration in no way diminishes or alters the jurisdictional interests of the Committee on Armed Services in this bill, any subsequent amendments, or similar legislation. Please place a copy of this letter and your response acknowledging our jurisdictional interest into the Congressional Record during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Sincerely, William M. ``Mac'' Thornberry, Chairman. ____ Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Washington, DC, December 1, 2016. Hon. William M. ``Mac'' Thornberry, Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Thornberry: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 5015, the ``Combat-Injured Veterans Tax Fairness Act of 2016.'' As you noted, the bill was referred to the Committee on Armed Services. I am most appreciative of your decision to waive formal consideration of H.R. 5015 so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor. I acknowledge that although you waived formal consideration of the bill, the Committee on Armed Services is in no way waiving its jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in those provisions of the bill that fall within your Rule X jurisdiction. I will include a copy of our letters in the Congressional Record during consideration of this legislation on the House floor. Sincerely, Kevin Brady, Chairman. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Brady for his efforts on behalf of this legislation. This is a pleasant responsibility that we have when you consider that its corrective action will alone help 175 former military members in the State of Massachusetts and 13,800 across the country. Let me reiterate some of the points that were made by Chairman Brady. The bill before us corrects an issue related to a provision that was designed to alleviate some of the tax burdens of our Nation's combat- injured veterans. Under Federal law, veterans who suffer combat-related injuries and who are separated from the military are not supposed to be taxed on the one-time lump-sum disability severance payment they receive from the Department of Defense. Due to an accounting error at the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, approximately $78 million in tax payments were inadvertently taken from combat-disabled servicemembers. Some of this improper withholding has taken place outside the 3-year period in which taxpayers could file an amended tax return. H.R. 5015 would right this wrong by instructing DOD to identify those who were wrongfully taxed so that they can be reimbursed. This bill would allow those veterans identified by the DOD to file amended returns to recoup those unintentionally withheld funds. Mr. Speaker, I am curious with respect to two items in this bill, and I just would like to raise this ever so politely with the majority party. Veterans' issues in the Congress have long had a bipartisan flavor to them. We have been supportive across the board in the efforts that we make as it relates to our veterans, and the differences we have generally are very small; but in this case, it does not appear that a Democrat was asked to cosponsor the bill in its original introduction. So I would hope in the future that even though this bill was largely [[Page H7158]] sponsored by Republican Members, that on this side you could have easily picked up 33 Members as well. So I hope going forward there will be that effort that we would continue with here to ensure that matters of this magnitude are well met by both parties. I would say that I don't want to suggest for a moment that this was done in a partisan atmosphere as much as I would like to think that it was just overlooked. I hope in the future that we would be considered for sponsorship of this sort of legislation as well. Also, I would like to highlight an issue that is akin to the matter that is before us, and it comes from our friends on the committee, Sam Johnson and John Larson. They worked together on legislation that would prevent exonerated felons from facing an undue tax burden with respect to payments they received due to their wrongful conviction--emphasis on ``wrongful conviction.'' Similar to the veterans in the situation before us, these wrongfully convicted individuals should not face an improper tax liability on amounts intended to compensate for the tremendous injustices they faced under our legal system. Legislation to that effect became law in 2015. However, due to the lengthy IRS process in providing guidance on the issue, the statute would only allow less than 5 months for these exonerated individuals to amend their prior year tax returns. Mr. Johnson and Mr. Larson of Connecticut have worked tirelessly to make sure that these individuals are not unfairly burdened further than they already have been and they have proposed extending the statutory deadline for these individuals to file amended returns. So while I think the legislation before us is sound, I do hope that the committee and the Congress will find time to consider similar IRS filing-deadline legislation with respect to these exonerated individuals. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Rouzer), who is the author of the bill in the House. Besides his advocacy for small businesses and job growth, he is also a champion for our military, especially those who have been injured in combat. Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, first, I want to make mention to the fine ranking member of the committee that we did reach out, certainly, to as many staff on the Democrat side as we possibly could. Perhaps we could have done a little bit better job of that, but I do want to make mention that we did make that effort--a point duly noted, though--and we will follow up multiple times the next time I have a bill that I think the gentleman would be interested in. Mr. Speaker, I filed H.R. 5015, the Combat-Injured Veterans Tax Fairness Act, after learning that nearly 14,000 veterans from all 50 States and the District of Columbia who suffered service-ending, combat-related injuries never received the full amount of their severance payment because taxes were wrongly withheld. Let me repeat that: nearly 14,000 veterans did not receive the money to which they were entitled because of a taxing error made by the Federal Government. Now, in case you are wondering how this error occurred, here is some background: the Internal Revenue Code excludes recurring disability payments from taxable income for personal injuries or sickness resulting from active service in our Armed Forces. In 1991, a Federal district court case, St. Clair v. United States, determined that one- time lump-sum disability severance payments received for injuries resulting from active service should be excluded from taxable income as well. Despite this court decision and the resulting regulatory guidance that stemmed from it, taxes on combat-related disability severance payments have been withheld for many years. As was mentioned earlier, the Defense Finance and Accounting System claimed this was due to the limitations of its automated computer payment system. Go figure. Regardless, this is an issue that needs to be addressed. Many of the veterans affected are not even aware that their benefits were improperly reduced. In most cases, the 3-year period in which they could file an amended tax return to get their money back has long since passed. This legislation directs the Department of Defense to identify instances of improper withholding and determine how much these combat- wounded veterans are owed. Those veterans who were adversely affected will then be able to apply to the IRS to receive the money they are rightfully due. Our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines risk their lives every day to protect our freedoms, our values, and our Republic. The revelation that there are thousands of veterans who did not receive their full disability severance pay is unacceptable, and it must be corrected immediately. Today we can make a great step towards rectifying this problem. I think we can all agree that these veterans deserve no less for their service and sacrifice to our Nation. I want to make special mention of Senator Boozman of Arkansas and Senator Warner of Virginia who have sponsored an identical bill in the United States Senate. Their leadership on this issue has been absolutely critical. I commend this legislation to my colleagues and encourage its passage. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I want to acknowledge the gentleman for his good effort and his thoughtful response to the point that I raised. Of course, thanks to Chairman Brady, this is an example, again, in a small way of how we can do some good things around here in a bipartisan manner. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. First, I really do applaud the work of Representative Rouzer in this area and the bipartisan work of Senators Boozman and Warner. This is an area that could have easily been just swept aside over the years and never really addressed. The gentleman continued to raise the issue, bring it to our attention, and work through the legislative process. Again, I thank the gentleman for his very important leadership. I also thank the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Chairman Mac Thornberry, and his team for their approval of this measure and willingness to work with the author to bring this forward. I, too, thank the ranking member, Mr. Neal, and congratulate him on his naming as ranking member for the Ways and Means Committee. I look forward to working with the gentleman on these and other issues moving forward. On behalf of 14,000 veterans who deserve to get the dollars they earned from the Department of Defense, late is better than never. I applaud the efforts of Mr. Rouzer in doing that. Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this bipartisan bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5015, Combat- Injured Veterans Tax Fairness Act of 2016, because the legislation directs the Defense Department (DoD) to restore improperly withheld for taxes from severance payments to individuals who retired or separated from service in the Armed Forces for combat-related injuries. The bill also requires the DoD to notify combat-injured veterans if it had improperly withheld tax on their severance pay any time after January 17, 1991 and provide the veterans with information on how to seek a refund from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). H.R. 5015 works to remedy the egregious action of withholding more than $78 million in taxes from almost 14,000 combat-injured veterans. This legislation additionally ensures that further tax amounts will not be taken from combat-injured veterans in the future. As a member of the House Committee on Homeland Security since its establishment, and current Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Security this bill is of importance to me. The DoD held an average of over $5,500 from each of the veterans since 1991. That amount of money could help combat-injured veterans with hospital bills and the difficult transition back into civilian life. I am pleased that the DoD will also have to submit a report on the number [[Page H7159]] of times it had withheld pay to combat-injured veterans, the amount of each severance payment it withheld, and its actions to prevent future improper withholding to Congress within one year of the bill's enactment for Congress to assess the situation. Our veterans deserve to be treated with respect. It is only through the efforts and sacrifice of our veterans that America has the freedoms and privileges we do today. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 5015. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5015, a bill that would improve the fairness of the tax code and treat our service members with the respect they are due. Veterans who suffered combat-related injuries who separated from the military are not supposed to be taxed on any one-time disability payments. Unfortunately, an accounting error has cost about 14,000 veterans more than $78 million in taxes. Just under 500 of these veterans are from my home state of Illinois.

I am troubled that some stakeholders are advocating that a 15 to 20 percent corporate tax rate serve as the central metric by which we judge any tax reform effort. To achieve this rate, middle- and low- income families and small businesses will have to subsidize the wealthiest corporations, foregoing critical credits and deductions that provide much needed assistance. I sincerely hope that we advance the intent of this bill to help Americans in need as we consider tax reform next year. I strongly support H.R. 5015, and I urge my colleagues to support its passage.

This is a pleasant responsibility that we have when you consider that its corrective action will alone help 175 former military members in the State of Massachusetts and 13,800 across the country. Let me reiterate some of the points that were made by Chairman Brady. The bill before us corrects an issue related to a provision that was designed to alleviate some of the tax burdens of our Nation's combat- injured veterans. Under Federal law, veterans who suffer combat-related injuries and who are separated from the military are not supposed to be taxed on the one-time lump-sum disability severance payment they receive from the Department of Defense. Due to an accounting error at the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, approximately $78 million in tax payments were inadvertently taken from combat-disabled servicemembers. Some of this improper withholding has taken place outside the 3-year period in which taxpayers could file an amended tax return. H.R. 5015 would right this wrong by instructing DOD to identify those who were wrongfully taxed so that they can be reimbursed. This bill would allow those veterans identified by the DOD to file amended returns to recoup those unintentionally withheld funds. Mr. Speaker, I am curious with respect to two items in this bill, and I just would like to raise this ever so politely with the majority party. Veterans' issues in the Congress have long had a bipartisan flavor to them. We have been supportive across the board in the efforts that we make as it relates to our veterans, and the differences we have generally are very small; but in this case, it does not appear that a Democrat was asked to cosponsor the bill in its original introduction. So I would hope in the future that even though this bill was largely [[Page H7158]] sponsored by Republican Members, that on this side you could have easily picked up 33 Members as well. So I hope going forward there will be that effort that we would continue with here to ensure that matters of this magnitude are well met by both parties. I would say that I don't want to suggest for a moment that this was done in a partisan atmosphere as much as I would like to think that it was just overlooked. I hope in the future that we would be considered for sponsorship of this sort of legislation as well. Also, I would like to highlight an issue that is akin to the matter that is before us, and it comes from our friends on the committee, Sam Johnson and John Larson. They worked together on legislation that would prevent exonerated felons from facing an undue tax burden with respect to payments they received due to their wrongful conviction--emphasis on ``wrongful conviction.'' Similar to the veterans in the situation before us, these wrongfully convicted individuals should not face an improper tax liability on amounts intended to compensate for the tremendous injustices they faced under our legal system. Legislation to that effect became law in 2015. However, due to the lengthy IRS process in providing guidance on the issue, the statute would only allow less than 5 months for these exonerated individuals to amend their prior year tax returns. Mr. Johnson and Mr. Larson of Connecticut have worked tirelessly to make sure that these individuals are not unfairly burdened further than they already have been and they have proposed extending the statutory deadline for these individuals to file amended returns. So while I think the legislation before us is sound, I do hope that the committee and the Congress will find time to consider similar IRS filing-deadline legislation with respect to these exonerated individuals. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Rouzer), who is the author of the bill in the House. Besides his advocacy for small businesses and job growth, he is also a champion for our military, especially those who have been injured in combat. Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, first, I want to make mention to the fine ranking member of the committee that we did reach out, certainly, to as many staff on the Democrat side as we possibly could. Perhaps we could have done a little bit better job of that, but I do want to make mention that we did make that effort--a point duly noted, though--and we will follow up multiple times the next time I have a bill that I think the gentleman would be interested in. Mr. Speaker, I filed H.R. 5015, the Combat-Injured Veterans Tax Fairness Act, after learning that nearly 14,000 veterans from all 50 States and the District of Columbia who suffered service-ending, combat-related injuries never received the full amount of their severance payment because taxes were wrongly withheld. Let me repeat that: nearly 14,000 veterans did not receive the money to which they were entitled because of a taxing error made by the Federal Government. Now, in case you are wondering how this error occurred, here is some background: the Internal Revenue Code excludes recurring disability payments from taxable income for personal injuries or sickness resulting from active service in our Armed Forces. In 1991, a Federal district court case, St. Clair v. United States, determined that one- time lump-sum disability severance payments received for injuries resulting from active service should be excluded from taxable income as well. Despite this court decision and the resulting regulatory guidance that stemmed from it, taxes on combat-related disability severance payments have been withheld for many years. As was mentioned earlier, the Defense Finance and Accounting System claimed this was due to the limitations of its automated computer payment system. Go figure. Regardless, this is an issue that needs to be addressed. Many of the veterans affected are not even aware that their benefits were improperly reduced. In most cases, the 3-year period in which they could file an amended tax return to get their money back has long since passed. This legislation directs the Department of Defense to identify instances of improper withholding and determine how much these combat- wounded veterans are owed. Those veterans who were adversely affected will then be able to apply to the IRS to receive the money they are rightfully due. Our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines risk their lives every day to protect our freedoms, our values, and our Republic. The revelation that there are thousands of veterans who did not receive their full disability severance pay is unacceptable, and it must be corrected immediately. Today we can make a great step towards rectifying this problem. I think we can all agree that these veterans deserve no less for their service and sacrifice to our Nation. I want to make special mention of Senator Boozman of Arkansas and Senator Warner of Virginia who have sponsored an identical bill in the United States Senate. Their leadership on this issue has been absolutely critical. I commend this legislation to my colleagues and encourage its passage. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I want to acknowledge the gentleman for his good effort and his thoughtful response to the point that I raised. Of course, thanks to Chairman Brady, this is an example, again, in a small way of how we can do some good things around here in a bipartisan manner. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. First, I really do applaud the work of Representative Rouzer in this area and the bipartisan work of Senators Boozman and Warner. This is an area that could have easily been just swept aside over the years and never really addressed. The gentleman continued to raise the issue, bring it to our attention, and work through the legislative process. Again, I thank the gentleman for his very important leadership. I also thank the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Chairman Mac Thornberry, and his team for their approval of this measure and willingness to work with the author to bring this forward. I, too, thank the ranking member, Mr. Neal, and congratulate him on his naming as ranking member for the Ways and Means Committee. I look forward to working with the gentleman on these and other issues moving forward. On behalf of 14,000 veterans who deserve to get the dollars they earned from the Department of Defense, late is better than never. I applaud the efforts of Mr. Rouzer in doing that. Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this bipartisan bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5015, Combat- Injured Veterans Tax Fairness Act of 2016, because the legislation directs the Defense Department (DoD) to restore improperly withheld for taxes from severance payments to individuals who retired or separated from service in the Armed Forces for combat-related injuries. The bill also requires the DoD to notify combat-injured veterans if it had improperly withheld tax on their severance pay any time after January 17, 1991 and provide the veterans with information on how to seek a refund from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). H.R. 5015 works to remedy the egregious action of withholding more than $78 million in taxes from almost 14,000 combat-injured veterans. This legislation additionally ensures that further tax amounts will not be taken from combat-injured veterans in the future. As a member of the House Committee on Homeland Security since its establishment, and current Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Security this bill is of importance to me. The DoD held an average of over $5,500 from each of the veterans since 1991. That amount of money could help combat-injured veterans with hospital bills and the difficult transition back into civilian life. I am pleased that the DoD will also have to submit a report on the number [[Page H7159]] of times it had withheld pay to combat-injured veterans, the amount of each severance payment it withheld, and its actions to prevent future improper withholding to Congress within one year of the bill's enactment for Congress to assess the situation. Our veterans deserve to be treated with respect. It is only through the efforts and sacrifice of our veterans that America has the freedoms and privileges we do today. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 5015. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5015, a bill that would improve the fairness of the tax code and treat our service members with the respect they are due. Veterans who suffered combat-related injuries who separated from the military are not supposed to be taxed on any one-time disability payments. Unfortunately, an accounting error has cost about 14,000 veterans more than $78 million in taxes. Just under 500 of these veterans are from my home state of Illinois. H.R. 5015 fixes this problem by instructing the DoD to identify those who were wrongfully taxed so that they can be reimbursed. The lion's share of the affected veterans are outside of the window for amending their tax returns to recoup the funds. Consequently, this bill would allow those veterans identified by the DoD to file amended returns to recoup these unintentionally-withheld funds. This is a good bill that helps our service members as we should. I hope that this chamber can engage in similar bipartisan efforts to support other needy Americans as we move into the next Congress. I am troubled that some stakeholders are advocating that a 15 to 20 percent corporate tax rate serve as the central metric by which we judge any tax reform effort. To achieve this rate, middle- and low- income families and small businesses will have to subsidize the wealthiest corporations, foregoing critical credits and deductions that provide much needed assistance. I sincerely hope that we advance the intent of this bill to help Americans in need as we consider tax reform next year. I strongly support H.R. 5015, and I urge my colleagues to support its passage. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5015, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________",package_114_212.csv,22715,22715,22785,"[congressional record volume 162, number 174 (monday, december 5, 2016)] [house] [pages h7156-h7159] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 1715 combat-injured veterans tax fairness act of 2016 mr. brady of texas. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 5015) to restore amounts improperly withheld for tax purposes from severance payments to individuals who retired or separated from service in the armed forces for combat-related injuries, and for other purposes, as amended. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 5015 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``combat-injured veterans tax fairness act of 2016''. sec. 2. findings. congress makes the following findings: (1) approximately 10,000 to 11,000 individuals are retired from service in the armed forces for medical reasons each year.

(3) congress has recognized the tremendous personal sacrifice of veterans with combat-related injuries by, among other things, specifically excluding from taxable income severance pay received for combat-related injuries. (4) since 1991, the secretary of defense has improperly withheld taxes from severance pay for wounded veterans, thus denying them their due compensation and a significant benefit intended by congress.

pro tempore. pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from texas (mr. brady) and the gentleman from massachusetts (mr. neal) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from texas. general leave mr. brady of texas. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on h.r. 5015, currently under consideration. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from texas? there was no objection. mr. brady of texas. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, we have responsibilities for all the brave men and women who protect and defend our great nation, especially those who are injured in the line of duty. the bill we are considering today by representative rouzer does just that. under our tax system, veterans who suffer from combat-related injuries are not required to pay taxes on the one-time lump-sum disability payment they receive when they leave the military. unfortunately, errors in the defense department's automatic payment system have resulted in taxes being improperly withheld from these injured troops' payments--sometimes for years on end. as a result, thousands of combat-injured veterans--men and women who have sacrificed greatly for our country--have not received the full compensation they are rightfully due. the combat-injured veterans tax fairness act provides an opportunity to right this wrong for veterans injured during their service. this legislation will allow veterans to recover income taxes that were improperly collected by the department of defense on certain disability severance payments. under this bill, the defense department will be required to identify all the veterans who have been impacted by this problem. they will inform these veterans of the full amount that has been improperly withheld from their disability payments, and they will provide detailed instructions on how veterans can recover the money through an amended tax return. our men and women in uniform and their families have sacrificed so much for our nation. errors like this are completely unacceptable and cannot be allowed to go unaddressed. i thank representative rouzer for his leadership on the combat- injured veterans tax fairness act and his dedication. this legislation takes important action to ensure america's promises are kept to our combat-injured heroes and their families. mr. speaker, i urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting its passage. i reserve the balance of my time. committee on armed services, house of representatives, washington, dc, november 30, 2016. hon. kevin brady, chairman, committee on ways and means, house of representatives, washington, dc. dear mr. chairman: i write concerning h.r. 5015, the combat-injured veterans tax fairness act of 2016, which was referred to the committee on armed services, and in addition to the committee on ways and means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the speaker. in order to expedite this legislation for floor consideration, the committee on armed services will forgo action on this bill. this decision is conditional on our mutual understanding that forgoing consideration in no way diminishes or alters the jurisdictional interests of the committee on armed services in this bill, any subsequent amendments, or similar legislation. please place a copy of this letter and your response acknowledging our jurisdictional interest into the congressional record during consideration of the measure on the house floor. sincerely, william m. ``mac'' thornberry, chairman. ____ committee on ways and means, house of representatives, washington, dc, december

the ``combat-injured veterans tax fairness act of 2016.'' as you noted, the bill was referred to the committee on armed services. i am most appreciative of your decision to waive formal consideration of h.r. 5015 so that it may proceed expeditiously to the house floor. i acknowledge that although you waived formal consideration of the bill, the committee on armed services is in no way waiving its jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in those provisions of the bill that fall within your rule x jurisdiction. i will include a copy of our letters in the congressional record during consideration of this legislation on the house floor. sincerely, kevin brady, chairman. mr. neal. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i thank chairman brady for his

amount of their severance payment because taxes were wrongly withheld. let me repeat that: nearly 14,000 veterans did not receive the money to which they were entitled because of a taxing error made

doing that. mr. speaker, i urge support for this bipartisan bill. i yield back the balance of my time. ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, i rise in support of h.r. 5015, combat- injured veterans tax fairness act of 2016, because the legislation directs the defense department (dod) to restore improperly withheld for taxes from severance payments to individuals who retired or separated from service in the armed forces for combat-related injuries. the bill also requires the dod to notify combat-injured veterans if it had improperly withheld tax on their severance pay any time after january 17,

held an average of over $5,500 from each of the veterans since 1991. that amount of money could help combat-injured veterans with hospital bills and the difficult transition back into civilian life. i am pleased that the dod will also have to submit a report on the number [[page h7159]] of times it had withheld pay to combat-injured veterans, the amount of each severance payment it withheld, and its actions to prevent future improper withholding to congress within one year of the bill's enactment for congress to assess the situation. our veterans deserve to be treated with respect. it is only through the efforts and sacrifice of our veterans that america has the freedoms and privileges we do today. i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting h.r. 5015. mr. danny k. davis of illinois. mr. speaker, i rise in strong support of h.r. 5015, a bill that would improve the fairness of the tax code and treat our service members with the respect they are due. veterans who suffered combat-related injuries who separated from the military are not supposed to be taxed on any one-time disability payments. unfortunately, an accounting error has cost about 14,000 veterans more than $78 million in

by which we judge any tax reform effort. to achieve this rate, middle- and low- income families and small businesses will have to subsidize the wealthiest corporations, foregoing critical credits and deductions that provide much needed assistance. i sincerely hope that we advance the intent of this bill to help americans in need as we consider tax reform next year. i strongly support h.r. 5015, and i urge my colleagues to support its passage. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from texas (mr. brady) that the house suspend the rules and pass the

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey. General Leave Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6427, the Creating Financial Prosperity for Businesses and Investors Act. It is a compilation of legislative initiatives that the Financial Services Committee has worked on in a very constructive and bipartisan manner during the 114th Congress. For 6 years, our committee, and, in particular, the Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government Sponsored Enterprises, has sought to break through the bipartisan gridlock in Washington and to ensure that the SEC, or the Securities and Exchange Commission, fulfills an important part of its mission to facilitate capital formation. For example, the JOBS Act of 2012, much of which originated in our committee, has already been a measurable success, as hundreds of companies have used its provisions to file for an initial public offering, and other businesses have been able to raise well over $50 billion worth of capital through private channels. Altogether, this translates to more growth, more innovation, and, most importantly, more jobs here for Americans who have been struggling in an economy that is producing only 1-2 percent growth, at best. We didn't stop at the JOBS Act, and both Republicans and Democrats on our committee came together and continued to generate good ideas that modernize our Nation's security laws for the benefit of the small- and medium-sized enterprises, which often pay a disproportionate share of the costs that come along with regulation. For example, during this Congress, our subcommittee has put forward nearly 40 bills to do just that, the vast majority of which gained, again, bipartisan support in both committee and here on the House floor. A year ago this month, a number of these measures were signed into law at the White House by the President. Today, we bring together a package of another six bills on the House floor with the hopes that we, once again, can improve the environment in which entrepreneurs and small businesses can operate. The provisions under H.R. 6427 include the following: First, a bill from Mr. Carney and Mr. Duffy that would create an Office of the Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation at the SEC. For too long, Mr. Speaker, the SEC has operated in a bureaucratic silo and ignored the needs of small and growing businesses and entrepreneurs. So we have Mr. Duffy's bill, which gives small businesses a permanent voice at the SEC, and it passed out of committee unanimously by a vote of 56-0. It also passed in the House overwhelmingly. Secondly, Mr. Speaker, is a bill from Mr. Poliquin that would require the SEC to respond to recommendations made at its annual government small business forum, ensuring that the SEC no longer simply ignores the ideas generated by small businesses at this event. This bill, again, passed our committee by a vote of 55-1 and passed the House by a vote of 390-1 earlier this year. [[Page H7155]] It also includes two bills from Mr. McHenry, who is on the floor and will be speaking later, one which would fix some of the more unworkable provisions of the crowd funding title of the JOBS Act, and a second bill that would modernize the threshold for when venture capital funds would have to register with the SEC. Again, there was huge bipartisan support, both passing out of committee 57-2 and garnering near- unanimous support here on the House floor. There are two more. Another title includes a bill from Dave Schweikert that would reform the definition of an accredited investor for certain securities offerings so that it is not just the wealthy or the well-connected who are able to invest in these companies. This bill passed the House earlier, again, with near-unanimous support. Finally, we have a bill from our Democratic colleague, Ms. Velazquez, that would make a technical correction to an outdated law that exempts investment companies from having to register in U.S. territories. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6427 contains innovation and much- needed legislation to help get our economy off the slow growth track that it has been on for too long, and it continues the good bipartisanship that our committee is known for. I want to take this moment to thank all my colleagues over the years for their hard work and willingness to work with us in a bipartisan manner to move legislation like this. {time} 1700 In particular, I thank our chairman, Jeb Hensarling, for his tremendous leadership of our full Financial Services Committee and for all the work that he has done to improve our capital markets in this country and to create a financial system that works for the benefit of all Americans. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 6427, a bipartisan package of commonsense measures that will help small businesses raise capital and better protect investors and retirees of the U.S. territories. Today's bill contains numerous bipartisan solutions to ensure the SEC is more responsive to small business regulatory concerns. For example, it creates a new Office of the Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation and a new Small Business Advisory Committee. Taken together, these efforts will ensure the agency is more responsive to entrepreneurs' needs. Furthermore, we have all heard that demand for small business capital outstrips supply. H.R. 6427 makes targeted changes to attract more investors to the small business market. By expanding definition of accredited investor, raising the investor cap on small venture capital funds, and making improvements to the equity crowdfunding rules implemented under the JOBS Act, this bill will help more startups and fast-growing businesses secure financing. Beyond the small business provisions, today's bill will provide investors and retirees in Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories the same protections as their mainland counterparts. For 7 decades, the Investment Company Act of 1940 provided U.S. investors with basic safeguards, regulating everything from leverage limits to capitalization levels, to preventing conflicts of interest. Due to a historical artifact, however, all funds located in and sold only to residents of U.S. territories are exempted from the act. The reason is U.S. territories were deemed to be too geographically distant from Washington, D.C. Obviously, the cost of air travel today is no longer an issue. Regulators routinely travel to Hawaii and Alaska to conduct oversight. In fact, SEC Chair White testified earlier this year that the exemption should be removed. To close the loophole and provide territorial residents with the protections they deserve, I introduced the U.S. Territories Investor Protection Act. Over the past year, we met with stakeholders, heard their concerns and further fine-tuned the bill. Investment companies will have an initial 3-year compliance period, with an option at the approval of the SEC, for an additional 3 years. This balances investor protections while granting more than reasonable time for financial institutions to comply. It is important to note that if investment companies need further relief, they are able to request such a reprieve under existing law. I thank Chairman Hensarling, Ranking Member Waters, and Congressman Garrett for working with me on this provision. Their cooperation was critical to developing an approach that would apply the act in a manner sensitive to investors and investment companies alike. In sum, I will argue that this is a strong bill. It will reduce compliance costs, facilitate access to capital for thousands of small businesses, and better protect investors and retirees in territories like Puerto Rico. I urge Members to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McHenry). I appreciate all of his hard work for the JOBS Act and all the rest of his work as vice chair of the committee and the time together that we had. Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his kind words and for his leadership on important issues in the capital markets. Today I rise to support the Creating Financial Prosperity for Businesses and Investors Act. Mr. Speaker, the title doesn't do the act justice. This is about helping families, communities, small businesses, entrepreneurs, those that are risk-takers in our society trying to make our society better, more prosperous, and helping families and communities like the one I represent in western North Carolina be better off. We need a growing economy to help families, to help small businesses, to help make us more prosperous as Americans. So this act deals with a couple of those areas in particular for families, small businesses, and entrepreneurs so they can gain greater access to lending, to loans, to capital that they need to help businesses grow and create jobs. Two of those bills, to that end, I authored earlier this year, which we passed with over 400 votes, as individual stand-alone items through the House of Representatives. Those two bills, Supporting America's Innovators Act, and the Fix Crowdfunding Act, in particular, amend existing securities laws to make it easier for small businesses and entrepreneurs to use innovative forms of capital formation. Investment crowdfunding and angel investing are two of those areas, in particular, to support those ideas that enable us to create jobs. Those two bills were a part of the larger package, that are a part of the innovation initiative that Leader McCarthy and I launched at the beginning of this year. A number of bills have moved through the House with wide bipartisan support that update outdated laws. So, today, this package is an important step in the right direction; but our work is not done. We have to continue to work with our Federal regulators and Members on both sides of the aisle to ensure that we update and ensure investment crowdfunding, angel investing, and other areas of innovation can actually be better deployed across our society and to more people. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' and ensure this bipartisan bill has wide approval here in the House today. Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Schweikert). Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I am here to speak about one of the ideas in this package that I have, shall we say, 5 or 6 years in; and the interesting thing, it was a conversation back and forth with a number of Democrats on the other side. It was one of those--it started as sort of a philosophical debate. Often you hear us fussing at each other here on the floor, and we will get into these debates of, well, the concentration of wealth in the country; [[Page H7156]] you know, the number of folks who now hold so much wealth. Yet, if you take a step backwards and look at the way we have our laws set up in this country, we don't decide that you get to invest in certain types of activities because of your talent. We don't decide you get to invest in certain activities because you are an expert in the technology or the business model. We actually have a series of rules that, if you have $1 million, you and your wife have a certain income, then you are allowed to invest. You think about that. So if I came to you right now and said, I am going to judge you by the size of your bank account and not by your competence, that would be pretty outrageous. I guess for years and years, none of us had really sort of talked about it, thought about it in that way, that the arbitrary rules that the SEC and we had allowed to continue were a world where we judged people by their wealth and then gave them additional opportunities instead of handing those same opportunities to people because of their expertise in investing or the technology, their expertise in understanding the risk profile of such technology. I am hoping that is where we are heading. There was a number of compromises to make both sides feel comfortable, and that is actually one of the reasons we had such a bipartisan vote; and to that, I also thank my friend, Chairman Garrett. I am going to miss you because you have worked hard to shepherd many of these concepts through for years now. I think this is a great start because we are going to start judging our brothers and sisters by their talents and not necessarily their bank account size, and that is why I am so happy on this one. Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, access to capital is the lifeblood of every business. By expanding the pool of accredited investors and venture capital firms, improving the equity crowdfunding rules, and giving small business a bigger voice in SEC decisionmaking, H.R. 6427 provides the tools necessary to inject much-needed equity capital into our Main Street businesses. Finally, closing the U.S. territories loophole in the Investment Company Act of 1940 will harmonize regulatory oversight and give millions of investors and retirees, mostly in Puerto Rico, the peace of mind that their hard-earned money will receive the same level of protection afforded to those on the mainland. I thank the chairman, ranking member, and all of the cosponsors for their hard work in bringing this bipartisan package to the floor. I urge Members to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise again to support the legislation. It dawns on me also that, as I rise today, this may be the last time that I rise on the floor. So let me just say what an honor it has been to stand at this podium to bring forth legislation like this, as I have done over the last 14 years, and to end where I began, to do so in a bipartisan manner, that they tell me we should be able to pass through today in a pretty overwhelmingly bipartisan manner as well. The gentleman from Arizona ended his remarks with the statement: Every day is a new beginning. So I look at that as my days ahead. This legislation is a new beginning for capital formation and is a new beginning for bipartisanship in future legislation as well. I thank my colleagues from the other side of the aisle that I have had the honor and privilege to work with on this legislation and other legislation as well. I thank my colleagues from my side of the aisle that I have had similar opportunity to do so as well. We have gone through challenging times, from good economic times and bad--maybe more bad than good--but, through it all, I think we have done so with the American public's interest in mind. Behind me also are some of our members of our committee who I also wish to recognize for their work as well. They have left a profound impact on myself during the time that I have known them, and I thank them humbly for their being willing to put up with me and to deal with me throughout the years, but be able to work together for the benefit of the American public as well. I think that, together, we have done great things. I look forward to watching what other great things will be done in a bipartisan manner as well. I think my time may be just about out, but let me also just say this as well. I want to end where I began, which was thanking the chairman of this committee, Mr. Jeb Hensarling, for his leadership and, most importantly, for his friendship in the years I have known him in this capacity. I urge every Member to support the underlying legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6427. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [House] [Pages H7152-H7156] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CREATING FINANCIAL PROSPERITY FOR BUSINESSES AND INVESTORS ACT Mr. GARRETT.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey. General Leave Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6427, the Creating Financial Prosperity for Businesses and Investors Act. It is a compilation of legislative initiatives that the Financial Services Committee has worked on in a very constructive and bipartisan manner during the 114th Congress. For 6 years, our committee, and, in particular, the Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government Sponsored Enterprises, has sought to break through the bipartisan gridlock in Washington and to ensure that the SEC, or the Securities and Exchange Commission, fulfills an important part of its mission to facilitate capital formation. For example, the JOBS Act of 2012, much of which originated in our committee, has already been a measurable success, as hundreds of companies have used its provisions to file for an initial public offering, and other businesses have been able to raise well over $50 billion worth of capital through private channels. Altogether, this translates to more growth, more innovation, and, most importantly, more jobs here for Americans who have been struggling in an economy that is producing only 1-2 percent growth, at best. We didn't stop at the JOBS Act, and both Republicans and Democrats on our committee came together and continued to generate good ideas that modernize our Nation's security laws for the benefit of the small- and medium-sized enterprises, which often pay a disproportionate share of the costs that come along with regulation. For example, during this Congress, our subcommittee has put forward nearly 40 bills to do just that, the vast majority of which gained, again, bipartisan support in both committee and here on the House floor. A year ago this month, a number of these measures were signed into law at the White House by the President. Today, we bring together a package of another six bills on the House floor with the hopes that we, once again, can improve the environment in which entrepreneurs and small businesses can operate. The provisions under H.R. 6427 include the following: First, a bill from Mr. Carney and Mr. Duffy that would create an Office of the Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation at the SEC. For too long, Mr. Speaker, the SEC has operated in a bureaucratic silo and ignored the needs of small and growing businesses and entrepreneurs. So we have Mr. Duffy's bill, which gives small businesses a permanent voice at the SEC, and it passed out of committee unanimously by a vote of 56-0. It also passed in the House overwhelmingly. Secondly, Mr. Speaker, is a bill from Mr. Poliquin that would require the SEC to respond to recommendations made at its annual government small business forum, ensuring that the SEC no longer simply ignores the ideas generated by small businesses at this event. This bill, again, passed our committee by a vote of 55-1 and passed the House by a vote of 390-1 earlier this year. [[Page H7155]] It also includes two bills from Mr. McHenry, who is on the floor and will be speaking later, one which would fix some of the more unworkable provisions of the crowd funding title of the JOBS Act, and a second bill that would modernize the threshold for when venture capital funds would have to register with the SEC. Again, there was huge bipartisan support, both passing out of committee 57-2 and garnering near- unanimous support here on the House floor. There are two more. Another title includes a bill from Dave Schweikert that would reform the definition of an accredited investor for certain securities offerings so that it is not just the wealthy or the well-connected who are able to invest in these companies. This bill passed the House earlier, again, with near-unanimous support. Finally, we have a bill from our Democratic colleague, Ms. Velazquez, that would make a technical correction to an outdated law that exempts investment companies from having to register in U.S. territories. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6427 contains innovation and much- needed legislation to help get our economy off the slow growth track that it has been on for too long, and it continues the good bipartisanship that our committee is known for. I want to take this moment to thank all my colleagues over the years for their hard work and willingness to work with us in a bipartisan manner to move legislation like this. {time} 1700 In particular, I thank our chairman, Jeb Hensarling, for his tremendous leadership of our full Financial Services Committee and for all the work that he has done to improve our capital markets in this country and to create a financial system that works for the benefit of all Americans. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 6427, a bipartisan package of commonsense measures that will help small businesses raise capital and better protect investors and retirees of the U.S. territories. Today's bill contains numerous bipartisan solutions to ensure the SEC is more responsive to small business regulatory concerns. For example, it creates a new Office of the Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation and a new Small Business Advisory Committee. Taken together, these efforts will ensure the agency is more responsive to entrepreneurs' needs. Furthermore, we have all heard that demand for small business capital outstrips supply. H.R. 6427 makes targeted changes to attract more investors to the small business market. By expanding definition of accredited investor, raising the investor cap on small venture capital funds, and making improvements to the equity crowdfunding rules implemented under the JOBS Act, this bill will help more startups and fast-growing businesses secure financing. Beyond the small business provisions, today's bill will provide investors and retirees in Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories the same protections as their mainland counterparts. For 7 decades, the Investment Company Act of 1940 provided U.S. investors with basic safeguards, regulating everything from leverage limits to capitalization levels, to preventing conflicts of interest. Due to a historical artifact, however, all funds located in and sold only to residents of U.S. territories are exempted from the act. The reason is U.S. territories were deemed to be too geographically distant from Washington, D.C. Obviously, the cost of air travel today is no longer an issue. Regulators routinely travel to Hawaii and Alaska to conduct oversight. In fact, SEC Chair White testified earlier this year that the exemption should be removed. To close the loophole and provide territorial residents with the protections they deserve, I introduced the U.S. Territories Investor Protection Act. Over the past year, we met with stakeholders, heard their concerns and further fine-tuned the bill. Investment companies will have an initial 3-year compliance period, with an option at the approval of the SEC, for an additional 3 years. This balances investor protections while granting more than reasonable time for financial institutions to comply. It is important to note that if investment companies need further relief, they are able to request such a reprieve under existing law. I thank Chairman Hensarling, Ranking Member Waters, and Congressman Garrett for working with me on this provision. Their cooperation was critical to developing an approach that would apply the act in a manner sensitive to investors and investment companies alike. In sum, I will argue that this is a strong bill. It will reduce compliance costs, facilitate access to capital for thousands of small businesses, and better protect investors and retirees in territories like Puerto Rico. I urge Members to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McHenry). I appreciate all of his hard work for the JOBS Act and all the rest of his work as vice chair of the committee and the time together that we had. Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his kind words and for his leadership on important issues in the capital markets. Today I rise to support the Creating Financial Prosperity for Businesses and Investors Act. Mr. Speaker, the title doesn't do the act justice. This is about helping families, communities, small businesses, entrepreneurs, those that are risk-takers in our society trying to make our society better, more prosperous, and helping families and communities like the one I represent in western North Carolina be better off. We need a growing economy to help families, to help small businesses, to help make us more prosperous as Americans. So this act deals with a couple of those areas in particular for families, small businesses, and entrepreneurs so they can gain greater access to lending, to loans, to capital that they need to help businesses grow and create jobs. Two of those bills, to that end, I authored earlier this year, which we passed with over 400 votes, as individual stand-alone items through the House of Representatives. Those two bills, Supporting America's Innovators Act, and the Fix Crowdfunding Act, in particular, amend existing securities laws to make it easier for small businesses and entrepreneurs to use innovative forms of capital formation. Investment crowdfunding and angel investing are two of those areas, in particular, to support those ideas that enable us to create jobs. Those two bills were a part of the larger package, that are a part of the innovation initiative that Leader McCarthy and I launched at the beginning of this year. A number of bills have moved through the House with wide bipartisan support that update outdated laws. So, today, this package is an important step in the right direction; but our work is not done. We have to continue to work with our Federal regulators and Members on both sides of the aisle to ensure that we update and ensure investment crowdfunding, angel investing, and other areas of innovation can actually be better deployed across our society and to more people. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' and ensure this bipartisan bill has wide approval here in the House today. Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Schweikert). Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I am here to speak about one of the ideas in this package that I have, shall we say, 5 or 6 years in; and the interesting thing, it was a conversation back and forth with a number of Democrats on the other side. It was one of those--it started as sort of a philosophical debate. Often you hear us fussing at each other here on the floor, and we will get into these debates of, well, the concentration of wealth in the country; [[Page H7156]] you know, the number of folks who now hold so much wealth. Yet, if you take a step backwards and look at the way we have our laws set up in this country, we don't decide that you get to invest in certain types of activities because of your talent. We don't decide you get to invest in certain activities because you are an expert in the technology or the business model. We actually have a series of rules that, if you have $1 million, you and your wife have a certain income, then you are allowed to invest. You think about that. So if I came to you right now and said, I am going to judge you by the size of your bank account and not by your competence, that would be pretty outrageous. I guess for years and years, none of us had really sort of talked about it, thought about it in that way, that the arbitrary rules that the SEC and we had allowed to continue were a world where we judged people by their wealth and then gave them additional opportunities instead of handing those same opportunities to people because of their expertise in investing or the technology, their expertise in understanding the risk profile of such technology. I am hoping that is where we are heading. There was a number of compromises to make both sides feel comfortable, and that is actually one of the reasons we had such a bipartisan vote; and to that, I also thank my friend, Chairman Garrett. I am going to miss you because you have worked hard to shepherd many of these concepts through for years now. I think this is a great start because we are going to start judging our brothers and sisters by their talents and not necessarily their bank account size, and that is why I am so happy on this one. Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, access to capital is the lifeblood of every business. By expanding the pool of accredited investors and venture capital firms, improving the equity crowdfunding rules, and giving small business a bigger voice in SEC decisionmaking, H.R. 6427 provides the tools necessary to inject much-needed equity capital into our Main Street businesses. Finally, closing the U.S. territories loophole in the Investment Company Act of 1940 will harmonize regulatory oversight and give millions of investors and retirees, mostly in Puerto Rico, the peace of mind that their hard-earned money will receive the same level of protection afforded to those on the mainland. I thank the chairman, ranking member, and all of the cosponsors for their hard work in bringing this bipartisan package to the floor. I urge Members to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise again to support the legislation. It dawns on me also that, as I rise today, this may be the last time that I rise on the floor. So let me just say what an honor it has been to stand at this podium to bring forth legislation like this, as I have done over the last 14 years, and to end where I began, to do so in a bipartisan manner, that they tell me we should be able to pass through today in a pretty overwhelmingly bipartisan manner as well. The gentleman from Arizona ended his remarks with the statement: Every day is a new beginning. So I look at that as my days ahead. This legislation is a new beginning for capital formation and is a new beginning for bipartisanship in future legislation as well. I thank my colleagues from the other side of the aisle that I have had the honor and privilege to work with on this legislation and other legislation as well. I thank my colleagues from my side of the aisle that I have had similar opportunity to do so as well. We have gone through challenging times, from good economic times and bad--maybe more bad than good--but, through it all, I think we have done so with the American public's interest in mind. Behind me also are some of our members of our committee who I also wish to recognize for their work as well. They have left a profound impact on myself during the time that I have known them, and I thank them humbly for their being willing to put up with me and to deal with me throughout the years, but be able to work together for the benefit of the American public as well. I think that, together, we have done great things. I look forward to watching what other great things will be done in a bipartisan manner as well. I think my time may be just about out, but let me also just say this as well. I want to end where I began, which was thanking the chairman of this committee, Mr. Jeb Hensarling, for his leadership and, most importantly, for his friendship in the years I have known him in this capacity. I urge every Member to support the underlying legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6427. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [House] [Pages H7152-H7156] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CREATING FINANCIAL PROSPERITY FOR BUSINESSES AND INVESTORS ACT Mr. GARRETT.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey. General Leave Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6427, the Creating Financial Prosperity for Businesses and Investors Act. It is a compilation of legislative initiatives that the Financial Services Committee has worked on in a very constructive and bipartisan manner during the 114th Congress. For 6 years, our committee, and, in particular, the Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government Sponsored Enterprises, has sought to break through the bipartisan gridlock in Washington and to ensure that the SEC, or the Securities and Exchange Commission, fulfills an important part of its mission to facilitate capital formation. For example, the JOBS Act of 2012, much of which originated in our committee, has already been a measurable success, as hundreds of companies have used its provisions to file for an initial public offering, and other businesses have been able to raise well over $50 billion worth of capital through private channels. Altogether, this translates to more growth, more innovation, and, most importantly, more jobs here for Americans who have been struggling in an economy that is producing only 1-2 percent growth, at best. We didn't stop at the JOBS Act, and both Republicans and Democrats on our committee came together and continued to generate good ideas that modernize our Nation's security laws for the benefit of the small- and medium-sized enterprises, which often pay a disproportionate share of the costs that come along with regulation. For example, during this Congress, our subcommittee has put forward nearly 40 bills to do just that, the vast majority of which gained, again, bipartisan support in both committee and here on the House floor. A year ago this month, a number of these measures were signed into law at the White House by the President. Today, we bring together a package of another six bills on the House floor with the hopes that we, once again, can improve the environment in which entrepreneurs and small businesses can operate. The provisions under H.R. 6427 include the following: First, a bill from Mr. Carney and Mr. Duffy that would create an Office of the Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation at the SEC. For too long, Mr. Speaker, the SEC has operated in a bureaucratic silo and ignored the needs of small and growing businesses and entrepreneurs. So we have Mr. Duffy's bill, which gives small businesses a permanent voice at the SEC, and it passed out of committee unanimously by a vote of 56-0. It also passed in the House overwhelmingly. Secondly, Mr. Speaker, is a bill from Mr. Poliquin that would require the SEC to respond to recommendations made at its annual government small business forum, ensuring that the SEC no longer simply ignores the ideas generated by small businesses at this event. This bill, again, passed our committee by a vote of 55-1 and passed the House by a vote of 390-1 earlier this year. [[Page H7155]] It also includes two bills from Mr. McHenry, who is on the floor and will be speaking later, one which would fix some of the more unworkable provisions of the crowd funding title of the JOBS Act, and a second bill that would modernize the threshold for when venture capital funds would have to register with the SEC. Again, there was huge bipartisan support, both passing out of committee 57-2 and garnering near- unanimous support here on the House floor. There are two more. Another title includes a bill from Dave Schweikert that would reform the definition of an accredited investor for certain securities offerings so that it is not just the wealthy or the well-connected who are able to invest in these companies. This bill passed the House earlier, again, with near-unanimous support. Finally, we have a bill from our Democratic colleague, Ms. Velazquez, that would make a technical correction to an outdated law that exempts investment companies from having to register in U.S. territories. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6427 contains innovation and much- needed legislation to help get our economy off the slow growth track that it has been on for too long, and it continues the good bipartisanship that our committee is known for. I want to take this moment to thank all my colleagues over the years for their hard work and willingness to work with us in a bipartisan manner to move legislation like this. {time} 1700 In particular, I thank our chairman, Jeb Hensarling, for his tremendous leadership of our full Financial Services Committee and for all the work that he has done to improve our capital markets in this country and to create a financial system that works for the benefit of all Americans. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 6427, a bipartisan package of commonsense measures that will help small businesses raise capital and better protect investors and retirees of the U.S. territories. Today's bill contains numerous bipartisan solutions to ensure the SEC is more responsive to small business regulatory concerns. For example, it creates a new Office of the Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation and a new Small Business Advisory Committee. Taken together, these efforts will ensure the agency is more responsive to entrepreneurs' needs. Furthermore, we have all heard that demand for small business capital outstrips supply. H.R. 6427 makes targeted changes to attract more investors to the small business market. By expanding definition of accredited investor, raising the investor cap on small venture capital funds, and making improvements to the equity crowdfunding rules implemented under the JOBS Act, this bill will help more startups and fast-growing businesses secure financing. Beyond the small business provisions, today's bill will provide investors and retirees in Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories the same protections as their mainland counterparts. For 7 decades, the Investment Company Act of 1940 provided U.S. investors with basic safeguards, regulating everything from leverage limits to capitalization levels, to preventing conflicts of interest. Due to a historical artifact, however, all funds located in and sold only to residents of U.S. territories are exempted from the act. The reason is U.S. territories were deemed to be too geographically distant from Washington, D.C. Obviously, the cost of air travel today is no longer an issue. Regulators routinely travel to Hawaii and Alaska to conduct oversight. In fact, SEC Chair White testified earlier this year that the exemption should be removed. To close the loophole and provide territorial residents with the protections they deserve, I introduced the U.S. Territories Investor Protection Act. Over the past year, we met with stakeholders, heard their concerns and further fine-tuned the bill. Investment companies will have an initial 3-year compliance period, with an option at the approval of the SEC, for an additional 3 years. This balances investor protections while granting more than reasonable time for financial institutions to comply. It is important to note that if investment companies need further relief, they are able to request such a reprieve under existing law. I thank Chairman Hensarling, Ranking Member Waters, and Congressman Garrett for working with me on this provision. Their cooperation was critical to developing an approach that would apply the act in a manner sensitive to investors and investment companies alike. In sum, I will argue that this is a strong bill. It will reduce compliance costs, facilitate access to capital for thousands of small businesses, and better protect investors and retirees in territories like Puerto Rico. I urge Members to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McHenry). I appreciate all of his hard work for the JOBS Act and all the rest of his work as vice chair of the committee and the time together that we had. Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his kind words and for his leadership on important issues in the capital markets. Today I rise to support the Creating Financial Prosperity for Businesses and Investors Act. Mr. Speaker, the title doesn't do the act justice. This is about helping families, communities, small businesses, entrepreneurs, those that are risk-takers in our society trying to make our society better, more prosperous, and helping families and communities like the one I represent in western North Carolina be better off. We need a growing economy to help families, to help small businesses, to help make us more prosperous as Americans. So this act deals with a couple of those areas in particular for families, small businesses, and entrepreneurs so they can gain greater access to lending, to loans, to capital that they need to help businesses grow and create jobs. Two of those bills, to that end, I authored earlier this year, which we passed with over 400 votes, as individual stand-alone items through the House of Representatives. Those two bills, Supporting America's Innovators Act, and the Fix Crowdfunding Act, in particular, amend existing securities laws to make it easier for small businesses and entrepreneurs to use innovative forms of capital formation. Investment crowdfunding and angel investing are two of those areas, in particular, to support those ideas that enable us to create jobs. Those two bills were a part of the larger package, that are a part of the innovation initiative that Leader McCarthy and I launched at the beginning of this year. A number of bills have moved through the House with wide bipartisan support that update outdated laws. So, today, this package is an important step in the right direction; but our work is not done. We have to continue to work with our Federal regulators and Members on both sides of the aisle to ensure that we update and ensure investment crowdfunding, angel investing, and other areas of innovation can actually be better deployed across our society and to more people. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' and ensure this bipartisan bill has wide approval here in the House today. Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Schweikert). Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I am here to speak about one of the ideas in this package that I have, shall we say, 5 or 6 years in; and the interesting thing, it was a conversation back and forth with a number of Democrats on the other side. It was one of those--it started as sort of a philosophical debate. Often you hear us fussing at each other here on the floor, and we will get into these debates of, well, the concentration of wealth in the country; [[Page H7156]] you know, the number of folks who now hold so much wealth. Yet, if you take a step backwards and look at the way we have our laws set up in this country, we don't decide that you get to invest in certain types of activities because of your talent. We don't decide you get to invest in certain activities because you are an expert in the technology or the business model. We actually have a series of rules that, if you have $1 million, you and your wife have a certain income, then you are allowed to invest. You think about that. So if I came to you right now and said, I am going to judge you by the size of your bank account and not by your competence, that would be pretty outrageous. I guess for years and years, none of us had really sort of talked about it, thought about it in that way, that the arbitrary rules that the SEC and we had allowed to continue were a world where we judged people by their wealth and then gave them additional opportunities instead of handing those same opportunities to people because of their expertise in investing or the technology, their expertise in understanding the risk profile of such technology. I am hoping that is where we are heading. There was a number of compromises to make both sides feel comfortable, and that is actually one of the reasons we had such a bipartisan vote; and to that, I also thank my friend, Chairman Garrett. I am going to miss you because you have worked hard to shepherd many of these concepts through for years now. I think this is a great start because we are going to start judging our brothers and sisters by their talents and not necessarily their bank account size, and that is why I am so happy on this one. Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, access to capital is the lifeblood of every business. By expanding the pool of accredited investors and venture capital firms, improving the equity crowdfunding rules, and giving small business a bigger voice in SEC decisionmaking, H.R. 6427 provides the tools necessary to inject much-needed equity capital into our Main Street businesses. Finally, closing the U.S. territories loophole in the Investment Company Act of 1940 will harmonize regulatory oversight and give millions of investors and retirees, mostly in Puerto Rico, the peace of mind that their hard-earned money will receive the same level of protection afforded to those on the mainland. I thank the chairman, ranking member, and all of the cosponsors for their hard work in bringing this bipartisan package to the floor. I urge Members to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise again to support the legislation. It dawns on me also that, as I rise today, this may be the last time that I rise on the floor. So let me just say what an honor it has been to stand at this podium to bring forth legislation like this, as I have done over the last 14 years, and to end where I began, to do so in a bipartisan manner, that they tell me we should be able to pass through today in a pretty overwhelmingly bipartisan manner as well. The gentleman from Arizona ended his remarks with the statement: Every day is a new beginning. So I look at that as my days ahead. This legislation is a new beginning for capital formation and is a new beginning for bipartisanship in future legislation as well. I thank my colleagues from the other side of the aisle that I have had the honor and privilege to work with on this legislation and other legislation as well. I thank my colleagues from my side of the aisle that I have had similar opportunity to do so as well. We have gone through challenging times, from good economic times and bad--maybe more bad than good--but, through it all, I think we have done so with the American public's interest in mind. Behind me also are some of our members of our committee who I also wish to recognize for their work as well. They have left a profound impact on myself during the time that I have known them, and I thank them humbly for their being willing to put up with me and to deal with me throughout the years, but be able to work together for the benefit of the American public as well. I think that, together, we have done great things. I look forward to watching what other great things will be done in a bipartisan manner as well. I think my time may be just about out, but let me also just say this as well. I want to end where I began, which was thanking the chairman of this committee, Mr. Jeb Hensarling, for his leadership and, most importantly, for his friendship in the years I have known him in this capacity. I urge every Member to support the underlying legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6427. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________",package_114_212.csv,41385,41385,41455,"[congressional record volume 162, number 174 (monday, december 5, 2016)] [house] [pages h7152-h7156] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] creating financial prosperity for businesses and investors act mr. garrett. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 6427) to improve the operation of united states capital markets, and for other purposes. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 6427 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title; table of contents.

[[page h7155]] it also includes two bills from mr. mchenry, who is on the floor and will be speaking later, one which would fix some of the more unworkable provisions of the crowd funding title of the jobs act, and a second bill that would modernize the threshold for when venture capital funds would have to register with the sec. again, there was huge bipartisan support, both passing out of committee 57-2 and garnering near- unanimous support here on the house floor. there are two more. another title includes a bill from dave schweikert that would reform the definition of an accredited investor for certain securities offerings so that it is not just the wealthy or the well-connected who are able to invest in these companies. this bill passed the house earlier, again, with near-unanimous support. finally, we have a bill from our democratic colleague, ms. velazquez, that would make a technical correction to an outdated law that exempts investment companies from having to register in u.s. territories. in conclusion, mr. speaker, h.r. 6427 contains innovation and much- needed legislation to help get our economy off the slow growth track that it has been on for too long, and it continues the good bipartisanship that our committee is known for. i want to take this moment to thank all my colleagues over the years for their hard work and willingness to work with us in a bipartisan manner to move legislation like this. {time} 1700 in particular, i thank our chairman, jeb hensarling, for his tremendous leadership of our full financial services committee and for all the work that he has done to improve our capital markets in this country and to create a financial system that works for the benefit of all americans. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. ms. velazquez. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i rise in support of h.r. 6427, a bipartisan package of commonsense measures that will help small businesses raise capital and better protect investors and retirees of the u.s. territories. today's bill contains numerous bipartisan solutions to ensure the sec is more responsive to small business regulatory concerns. for example, it creates a new office of the advocate for small business capital formation and a new small business advisory committee. taken together, these efforts will ensure the agency is more responsive to entrepreneurs' needs. furthermore, we have all heard that demand for small business capital outstrips supply. h.r. 6427 makes targeted changes to attract more investors to the small business market. by expanding definition of accredited investor, raising the investor cap on small venture capital funds, and making improvements to the equity crowdfunding rules implemented under the jobs act, this bill will help more startups and fast-growing businesses secure financing. beyond the small business provisions, today's bill will provide investors and retirees in puerto rico and other u.s. territories the same protections as their mainland counterparts. for 7 decades, the investment company act of 1940 provided u.s. investors with basic safeguards, regulating everything from leverage limits to capitalization levels, to preventing conflicts of interest. due to a historical artifact, however, all funds located in and sold only to residents of u.s. territories are exempted from the act. the reason is u.s. territories were deemed to be too geographically distant from washington, d.c. obviously, the cost of air travel today is no longer an issue. regulators routinely travel to hawaii and alaska to conduct oversight. in fact, sec chair white testified earlier this year that the exemption should be removed. to close the loophole and provide territorial residents with the protections they deserve, i introduced the u.s. territories investor protection act. over the past year, we met with stakeholders, heard their concerns and further fine-tuned the bill. investment companies will have an initial 3-year compliance period, with an option at the approval of the sec, for an additional 3 years. this balances investor protections while granting more than reasonable time for financial institutions to comply. it is important to note that if investment companies need further relief, they are able to request such a reprieve under existing law. i thank chairman hensarling, ranking member waters, and congressman garrett for working with me on this provision. their cooperation was critical to developing an approach that would apply the act in a manner sensitive to investors and investment companies alike. in sum, i will argue that this is a strong bill. it will reduce compliance costs, facilitate access to capital for thousands of small businesses, and better protect investors and retirees in territories like puerto rico. i urge members to support this legislation, and i reserve the balance of my time. mr. garrett. mr. speaker, i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from north carolina (mr. mchenry). i appreciate all of his hard work for the jobs act and all the rest of his work as vice chair of the committee and the time together that we had. mr. mchenry. mr. speaker, i thank my colleague for his kind words and for his leadership on important issues in the capital markets. today i rise to support the creating financial prosperity for businesses and investors act. mr. speaker, the title doesn't do the act justice. this is about helping families, communities, small businesses, entrepreneurs, those that are risk-takers in our society trying to make our society better, more prosperous, and helping families and communities like the one i represent in western north carolina be better off. we need a growing economy to help families, to help small businesses, to help make us more prosperous as americans. so this act deals with a couple of those areas in particular for families, small businesses, and entrepreneurs so they can gain greater access to lending, to loans, to capital that they need to help businesses grow and create jobs. two of those bills, to that end, i authored earlier this year, which we passed with over 400 votes, as individual stand-alone items through the house of representatives. those two bills, supporting america's innovators act, and the fix crowdfunding act, in particular, amend existing securities laws to make it easier for small businesses and entrepreneurs to use innovative forms of capital formation. investment crowdfunding and angel investing are two of those areas, in particular, to support those ideas that enable us to create jobs. those two bills were a part of the larger package, that are a part of the innovation initiative that leader mccarthy and i launched at the beginning of this year. a number of bills have moved through the house with wide bipartisan support that update outdated laws. so, today, this package is an important step in the right direction; but our work is not done. we have to continue to work with our federal regulators and members on both sides of the aisle to ensure that we update and ensure investment crowdfunding, angel investing, and other areas of innovation can actually be better deployed across our society and to more people. i urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' and ensure this bipartisan bill has wide approval here in the house today. ms. velazquez. mr. speaker, i continue to reserve the balance of my time. mr. garrett. mr. speaker, i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from arizona (mr. schweikert). mr. schweikert. mr. speaker, i am here to speak about one of the ideas in this package that i have, shall we say, 5 or 6 years in; and the interesting thing, it was a conversation back and forth with a number of democrats on the other side. it was one of those--it started as sort of a philosophical debate. often you hear us fussing at each other here on the floor, and we will get into these debates of, well, the concentration of wealth in the country; [[page h7156]] you know, the number of folks who now hold so much wealth. yet, if you take a step backwards and look at the way we have our laws set up in this country, we don't decide that you get to invest in certain types of activities because of your talent. we don't decide you get to invest in certain activities because you are an expert in the technology or the business model. we actually have a series of rules that, if you have $1 million, you and your wife have a certain income, then you are allowed to invest. you think about that. so if i came to you right now and said, i am going to judge you by the size of your bank account and not by your competence, that would be pretty outrageous. i guess for years and years, none of us had really sort of talked about it, thought about it in that way, that the arbitrary rules that the sec and we had allowed to continue were a world where we judged people by their wealth and then gave them additional opportunities instead of handing those same opportunities to people because of their expertise in investing or the technology, their expertise in understanding the risk profile of such technology. i am hoping that is where we are heading. there was a number of compromises to make both sides feel comfortable, and that is actually one of the reasons we had such a bipartisan vote; and to that, i also thank my friend, chairman garrett. i am going to miss you because you have worked hard to shepherd many of these concepts through for years now. i think this is a great start because we are going to start judging our brothers and sisters by their talents and not necessarily their bank account size, and that is why i am so happy on this one. ms. velazquez. mr. speaker, i am prepared to close. i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, access to capital is the lifeblood of every business. by expanding the pool of accredited investors and venture capital firms, improving the equity crowdfunding rules, and giving small business a bigger voice in sec decisionmaking, h.r. 6427 provides the tools necessary to inject much-needed equity capital into our main street businesses. finally, closing the u.s. territories loophole in the investment company act of 1940 will harmonize regulatory oversight and give millions of investors and retirees, mostly in puerto rico, the peace of mind that their hard-earned money will receive the same level of protection afforded to those on the mainland. i thank the chairman, ranking member, and all of the cosponsors for their hard work in bringing this bipartisan package to the floor. i urge members to support this bill, and i yield back the balance of my time. mr. garrett. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i rise again to support the legislation. it dawns on me also that, as i rise today, this may be the last time that i rise on the floor. so let me just say what an honor it has been to stand at this podium to bring forth legislation like this, as i have done over the last 14 years, and to end where i began, to do so in a bipartisan manner, that they tell me we should be able to pass through today in a pretty overwhelmingly bipartisan manner as well. the gentleman from arizona ended his remarks with the statement: every day is a new beginning. so i look at that as my days ahead. this legislation is a new beginning for capital formation and is a new beginning for bipartisanship in future legislation as well. i thank my colleagues from the other side of the aisle that i have had the honor and privilege to work with on this legislation and other legislation as well. i thank my colleagues from my side of the aisle that i have had similar opportunity to do so as well. we have gone through challenging times, from good economic times and bad--maybe more bad than good--but, through it all, i think we have done so with the american public's interest in mind. behind me also are some of our members of our committee who i also wish to recognize for their work as well. they have left a profound impact on myself during the time that i have known them, and i thank them humbly for their being willing to put up with me and to deal with me throughout the years, but be able to work together for the benefit of the american public as well. i think that, together, we have done great things. i look forward to watching what other great things will be done in a bipartisan manner as well. i think my time may be just about out, but let me also just say this as well. i want to end where i began, which was thanking the chairman of this committee, mr. jeb hensarling, for his leadership and, most importantly, for his friendship in the years i have known him in this capacity. i urge every member to support the underlying legislation, and i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from new jersey (mr. garrett) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 6427. the question was taken. the speaker pro tempore. in the opinion of the chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. mr. garrett. mr. speaker, on that i demand the yeas and nays. the yeas and nays were ordered. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to clause 8 of rule xx, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________",41385

No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act and the amendments made by this Act. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. General Leave Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the ranking member of this committee, Mr. Eliot Engel, for his work on this important piece of legislation to protect U.S. personnel overseas, to improve the oversight of the Department of State, and to modernize its workforce. And I would also like to thank the other members of the committee for their input as well on this legislation. The world is not getting any easier for the men and women serving overseas who represent this country at the Department of State. These men and women work with many other agencies, including the Defense Department. They have got a wide range of very important responsibilities. They try to broker peace agreements. And, of course, not everybody wants peace in these agreements. They have to fight human trafficking. In other words, they have got to stand up to the criminal syndicates in some of these countries. They have got to help our fellow Americans in distress. That is just to name a few of the dangerous tasks that they undertake. They work hard, often in very challenging, even life- threatening circumstances, so they deserve our support, which includes reforming a department that sorely needs to modernize. Mr. Speaker, the annual authorization of the Department of State is critical to maintaining congressional oversight and making these needed agency reforms. The House has passed an authorization bill in each of the last six Congresses, but, unfortunately, it has been 15 years since this legislation was signed into law. This year, we have an opportunity to break that unfortunate streak, which makes this legislation all the more important. First and foremost, the bill includes a number of critical embassy security reforms and improvements. For example, the Department will be authorized to use so-called best value criteria when contracting for local guards at U.S. facilities overseas. This is an important change. [[Page H7173]] This authority has consistently been requested by the professionals overseeing the security at our embassies and has been a particular focus of two members of the committee. So I would like to thank Lois Frankel and Randy Weber for their work. The bill requires the State Department to designate a list of high- risk, high-threat posts, effectively prioritizing the resources and the security for these posts. Now, these are the posts most at risk. The State Department and Defense Department are directed to jointly develop enhanced contingency plans. Why? Because there are going to be surprises overseas. There are going to be emergency situations, including planning for the rapid deployment of military resources to keep our personnel safe in a time of crisis. It includes provisions that improve security for the children and the families of U.S. diplomats abroad. And it makes sure that security failures, due to misconduct or due to unsatisfactory performance, are identified and those responsible are held accountable, something that did not happen when it came to the Islamist terrorist attack in Benghazi. No one lost a day of pay as a consequence of the mistakes made there. The bill increases accountability also for sexual exploitation and abuse by U.N. peacekeepers, which the Foreign Affairs Committee has helped expose through the hearings by Chairman Chris Smith. It also increases transparency for how U.S. funds are spent at the United Nations and mandates that the Department work to increase the number of American citizens employed by the United Nations. This has been a focus of Mr. Mo Brooks. We have also included important provisions to bolster the State Department's inspector general, an office that the Foreign Affairs Committee successfully fought to have filled after it sat vacant for 5 years. And lastly, the bill increases flexibility in the Department's workforce, allowing civil servants more opportunities to serve overseas and authorizing a pilot program to acquire skilled workers from the private sector. The passage of this legislation, S. 1635, would strengthen the law. It is a bipartisan bill, it improves congressional oversight of the Department, and I think it deserves unanimous support. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of this bill. Mr. Speaker, let me start by thanking my friend and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Ed Royce of California. He and I and our staffs have been working on this bill for most of the 114th Congress. This may be the last Foreign Affairs bill the House will deal with this year, and it is an appropriate capstone for the committee's work. Authorizing and overseeing the State Department is one of our committee's most important responsibilities. As the Obama administration comes to an end and we deal with the uncertainties of a transition in power, it is important that Congress help to set the tone for the future of our foreign policy. We need to do all we can to ensure the future of America's leadership role in the world. {time} 1745 This bill is also long, long overdue as the chairman pointed out. The last time the President signed a State Department authorization was in the year 2002. So much has changed since then--from the invasion of Iraq and the subsequent rise of ISIS to the ascendance of the Asia- Pacific in our foreign policy to the growing threat of climate change. Think about the way terrorist groups use social media to recruit fighters and spread propaganda. This has become a major foreign policy concern; yet the last time we passed the State Department authorization, Twitter and Facebook were still a few years from coming online. Imagine that. That is just one example. In nearly 15 years, countless issues have cropped up as new foreign policy concerns, and traditional areas of diplomacy and development have evolved. This bill will help the State Department keep pace with the changes. I would like to underscore a few provisions in this bill that I think are especially important. The main thing I want to talk about is the heart and soul of American diplomacy: our diplomats. Our diplomats are at the core of this bill. We want them to have the tools and resources for success. These men and women pursue a path of public service unlike any other, going to work--sometimes in dangerous places--as America's face to the world. Diplomats are our front line of international engagement, advancing our interests and building bridges of friendship and understanding. This is incredibly important work. It requires the right people for the job--people with the skill, training, and confidence to carry out their work. We need to do all we can to enable our diplomats to carry out diplomacy. They need to be able to get out from behind a desk and engage directly with cultures and communities, from government officials to civil society groups to everyday people on the street; so we have included provisions in this bill that are focused on the security of our Embassies and on the proper training of our personnel. We need the best possible security for our Embassies and diplomats abroad, and good security doesn't always come cheap. This bill says that, when the State Department hires local personnel to protect our diplomatic facilities and staff, they shouldn't be constrained only to take the lowest cost bid. After all, the rule is generally true that you get what you pay for, and when it comes to the safety of our diplomats, we should be focused on quality in addition to cost; so we have included a provision that calls for the best value security rather than the lowest cost. There is a lot of value in keeping our diplomats safe, and I want to thank representative Lois Frankel for her work on this provision. With this bill, we have also focused on improving the security of what we call ``soft targets,'' not typical diplomatic facilities, but things like schools and schoolbuses for the children of diplomats abroad. It is also important that the State Department reflect who we are as a country. America is made up of people from all different backgrounds and perspectives. Our diversity is one of our strengths. Our Foreign Service should benefit from that strength and reflect it back to the world. We also need to incorporate that strength into our foreign policy. A diverse workforce means a diversity of views and experiences to aid our leaders when they face tough decisions. Old ways of thinking and worn- out approaches aren't well suited to the modern range of challenges our diplomats face. This bill will push the Department to recruit, train, and retain a diverse workforce. Reports tell us that the State Department has been slow to change in these areas, so we want to give those efforts a shot in the arm. Additionally, I thank Chairman Royce for including my Western Hemisphere Drug Policy Commission legislation in this bill. The heroin epidemic in this country is getting worse and worse. We need to make sure that our drug policy is focused on saving lives. Here at home, that means doing more on prevention and treatment. Looking abroad, we need to take stock of what has worked and what hasn't when it comes to our drug policy in Latin America and the Caribbean. That is what this commission will do, and I am grateful this measure is moving forward. That idea, taking stock of our successes and failures, brings me to a few final thoughts on this bill. Even though Congress has a role in foreign policy, we are outside the day-to-day decisionmaking structures. That outside perspective gives us a chance to step back and ask: What can we be doing better? Where can we cut away dead wood? What changes going on in the world require us to change our approach? Our State Department personnel may have great new ideas about the way to advance our interests, but they are constrained by existing law or are bogged down in the constant hard work demanded of them. Let's be honest. By their nature, bureaucracies tend not to change on their own. That is when Congress needs to step in and say: ``We can help to solve this problem. We can make it easier for our diplomats to do their jobs.'' The thing is that we have [[Page H7174]] to actually do that. We should try to pass a bill like this every year. It should become the way we do business, just like the defense authorization, because when we don't, we are letting our diplomats down; we are also ceding their work to other jurisdictions, and we are missing opportunities to bolster American diplomacy and national security. Last week, we voted on the Defense Authorization Act. It included 80 provisions that fell, at least in part, under the jurisdiction of the Foreign Affairs Committee when it landed on the President's desk. I respect our friends on the Armed Services Committee a great deal, but I hear their message loud and clear, that if we don't act in our own jurisdiction, someone else will. I am encouraged that we have made it this far on this bill. I hope it becomes a regular part of our committee's work and that, a year from now, we are back here debating more good ideas about improving American diplomacy. For now, I again thank the chairman. I am glad to support this bill, and I urge all my colleagues to do the same. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith). He is the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I thank my good friend, the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Royce, for his leadership on this important bill. I thank Eliot Engel, the ranking member, and, of course, Senators Corker and Cardin. This is a true bipartisan piece of legislation. I thank my colleagues for their leadership on this. Mr. Speaker, a highly skilled group of Foreign Service Officers-- about 15,000 strong--are deployed worldwide to promote peace and human rights, to support prosperity, and to protect Americans while advancing the vital interests of the United States abroad. For most, posting overseas requires serious personal sacrifice. For some, deployment entails serious danger--from disease, crime, and terrorism. Mr. Speaker, after the American Embassies in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi were attacked by terrorists in August of 1998, I chaired hearings on Embassy security in my subcommittee and authored the Admiral James W. Nance and Meg Donovan Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 2000 and 2001 to significantly boost Embassy security, including reconfigured Embassies, setbacks--a zone that puts the street farther away from the building--and additional diplomatic security personnel. The bill, dubbed the ``Embassy Security Act,'' which passed the House in 1999, never even got a vote in the Senate; but after much lobbying, my bill was included in its entirety in the FY 2000 appropriations omnibus. In 2005, Congress enacted into law another bill I sponsored, the Department of State Authorities Act, which, among other things, boosted danger pay. Today, the Royce-Corker-Engel-Cardin bill authorizes $4.8 billion for Embassy security. It continues the all-important work of ensuring the most effective security possible for our Foreign Service and Americans abroad by directing joint DOD-State contingency plans--including the rapid deployment of Armed Forces--the designation of high-risk, high- threat posts with adequate funding and training commensurate with the danger, and the utilization of ``best value'' contracting. The bill provides numerous enhancements of personnel issues for our men and women in the Foreign Service--from promotion opportunities to updated cost-of-living adjustments to improved care of Foreign Service officers' children-dependents with autism spectrum disorders. During markup--and I thank the chair for being so gracious for supporting it--I sponsored an amendment that was approved that recognizes applied behavior analysis, or ABA, as proven evidence-based intervention for autistic children and that the Secretary of State should ensure that coverage of and access to ABA for dependents with ASD of overseas employees is provided. I travel all over the world, and I often hear from Foreign Service Officers who cannot get ABA treatment for their children. They are anguished because, if they try to go to a deployment where that is provided, it may hinder their Foreign Service careers; and, of course, they put their children first. That shouldn't be the case. There should be no choice. The children need to be supported as well as the Foreign Service Officers. The House Foreign Affairs Committee also adopted another amendment I offered during markup, which is whistleblower protections for U.N. personnel--we have had hearings on that in our subcommittee--the capacity to investigate allegations of sexual exploitation committed by peacekeepers and to hold those who commit such heinous crimes accountable. Mr. Speaker, I have traveled to places like Goma, in the DRC, where peacekeepers were raping 13-year-olds--U.N. peacekeepers. The series of hearings that we held on it found that the zero tolerance policy of the U.N. was really zero compliance. That has to improve. There have been some improvements made but far fewer than what are required. This legislation helps to push that ball significantly down that lane. Hopefully, the peacekeepers will do just that--protect. It is a duty for us to make sure that that happens. There are many other good things in this bill. Again, I thank Chairman Royce for his leadership. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, in reclaiming my time, I thank Chris Smith for his years of oversight and for his combating that type of abuse. I also thank him for our efforts to have this included now in what will become a new law. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly), my good friend and colleague on the Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. CONNOLLY. I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel), my dear friend and the distinguished ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. I rise today in support of S. 1635, the Department of State Authorities Act. There is an expression in Latin. I studied Latin for 6 years, but I rarely get to use it. It is mirabile dictu--wonderful to relate--that we are actually going to pass the State Department authorization bill. The bill is not perfect, and it is not as comprehensive as one would hope; however, it is a product of compromise under the fine leadership of Ed Royce and Eliot Engel. It is a welcome step toward the annual authorization of the State Department operations I know we will get to next year. The regular enactment of a State Department authorization is a long-neglected priority, and the clarity of our diplomacy and development missions have suffered absent one. Congress has not enacted a full State authorization bill since 2002. In a similar vein, the Foreign Assistance Act has not undergone a comprehensive reauthorization since 1985, when I was a staff member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I have introduced the Global Partnerships Act, which would do just that, and I have tried to streamline and modernize the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The bill on the floor today codifies high standards for Embassy security practices and ensures that we are making smart investments in diplomatic security. It also fights discrimination and promotes diversity within the Foreign Service. I thank the committee--and particularly our leaders, Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel--for including my amendment that requires the State Department to report on its compliance with the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act, FITARA, which is the Federal IT reform bill I introduced and wrote with Mr. Issa. I support this bill because it enables the kind of serious, credible, and ambitious diplomacy that can solve the world's most intractable challenges, and I urge my colleagues to give it their full support. Again, I congratulate our staffs--and particularly our chairman and ranking member, Mr. Royce and Mr. Engel, respectively--for their leadership in bringing this bill before us today. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. [[Page H7175]] Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am waiting for one other speaker; so, while we are waiting, let me at least partially close. I, first of all, thank Chairman Royce's staff for their hard work on this very important bill. I thank Tom Sheehy, Ed Burrier, Tom Hill, and Doug Anderson, and on my staff, Jason Steinbaum, Doug Campbell, Eric Jacobstein, Janice Kaguyutan, Sajit Gandhi, Jennifer Hendrixson White, and Mark Iozzi. We can only do as well as the wonderful staff that we have, and it is really appreciated, I know, by Chairman Royce and by me. As was said before, Mr. Speaker, every single year, Congress passes a defense authorization. It happens without fail, and it should. It is a vitally important piece of legislation, and we have an obligation to give our women and men in uniform the support and the resources they need. {time} 1800 The work of our diplomats is very different, but it is also critical to our national security. These dedicated public servants help to project stability, enhance security, and diffuse crises before they start. From a dollars-and-cents perspective, it makes a lot more sense to prevent crises than to try to stop them after they are burning out of control. We need diplomacy to succeed so that using our military remains the last resort in our foreign policy. This legislation will help ensure that our diplomacy does succeed. I hope this bill gets across the finish line soon; I hope the Senate does its job; and I hope we make a State Department authorization a yearly priority for the Foreign Affairs Committee, for the Congress, and for the American people. I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert). Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I am a big fan of Chairman Royce's work, and I appreciate all the work of the committee in these difficult areas. Sometimes in trying to bring together a big authorization bill like this, language gets inserted that can be problematic. On page 105, for example, section 713, ``Recruitment and retention of individuals who have lived, worked, or studied in predominantly Muslim countries or communities,'' we know that one of our problems when we were trying to deal with radical Islam is, number one, our President doesn't recognize radical Islam, although some of the best experts who are radical Islamists say, yes, it exists, and Muslim friends like President el- Sisi acknowledge it is a problem. For example, here in subsection C, it says: ``The Secretary shall make every effort to recruit and retain individuals that have lived, worked, or studied in predominantly Muslim countries or communities, including individuals who have studied at Islamic institutions of higher learning.'' I know this was not submitted by a Muslim--far from it--but although we desperately need people who have lived and studied in this area, to tell the Secretary of State that the Secretary shall make every effort to get people like this is the way our enemies take advantage of us. We should not be telling the Secretary to make every effort. As a former chief justice, that is the kind of thing--you have to say, well, he didn't make every effort or she didn't make every effort. We should not be coercing the State Department to hire people who--if they are not appropriate or have Muslim ties, they should not be pushed into the State Department. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, let me say in response that we should hire, in the State Department, people who do have some experience. We should have some people there with some experience with Muslim culture and Muslim countries, with that kind of a background. But that said, we want to work with the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) on implementation of this bill to make certain that these concerns are handled. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Frankel). Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel, first, for the great bipartisan work. I really appreciate being on this committee. I want to tell you a story that one of our Ambassadors told me that I thought was amazing. I won't say her name or where she was, but she told me she was overseas. The security that they hired was so poor that they actually had to hire criminals; and her security guard not only robbed her and her family, but killed their dog. That is just an example of some of the quality of security that we had for our Ambassadors, who deserve absolutely our utmost protection. So I just want to thank both the chairman and the ranking member for working with me to get this provision in this bill that now is going to let our State Department get well-qualified security for Embassies, which they deserve to have. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to thank the gentlewoman from Florida for her contribution to this legislation. Mr. Speaker, as chairman, I also want to thank our ranking member, Mr. Engel. I want to thank all my committee colleagues for their contributions to this bill. I think we should take the opportunity to thank our counterparts, Senator Corker and Senator Cardin, in the Senate for working with us to bring the first State authorization bill to the President's desk in over 15 years. Today, the Department is considering how to deploy diplomats in high- threat, high-risk places like South Sudan, like the Central African Republic, Yemen, Libya. It is our responsibility to make sure that U.S. personnel at these posts have every available means of protection, and this bill authorizes the Department to make critical upgrades in Embassy security. This bill also mandates that the Department uses leverage at the United Nations to make improvements that have been ignored for too long. In just the last year, we have heard horrific stories of peacekeepers sexually abusing and exploiting those they are sent to protect. Sadly, these are not the first instances of such predatory behavior, but the United Nations has failed to take steps to stop it. Oversight is necessary at any agency. It took 5 years for the Department's inspector general position to be filled, and this bill makes sure that the Department's watchdog has all the tools it needs to perform its mandate. This bill deserves our support. The other body should move quickly so that these critical reforms can be signed into law by the President. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 1635, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [House] [Pages H7160-H7175] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEPARTMENT OF STATE OPERATIONS AUTHORIZATION AND EMBASSY SECURITY ACT, FISCAL YEAR 2016 Mr. ROYCE.

No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act and the amendments made by this Act. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. General Leave Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the ranking member of this committee, Mr. Eliot Engel, for his work on this important piece of legislation to protect U.S. personnel overseas, to improve the oversight of the Department of State, and to modernize its workforce. And I would also like to thank the other members of the committee for their input as well on this legislation. The world is not getting any easier for the men and women serving overseas who represent this country at the Department of State. These men and women work with many other agencies, including the Defense Department. They have got a wide range of very important responsibilities. They try to broker peace agreements. And, of course, not everybody wants peace in these agreements. They have to fight human trafficking. In other words, they have got to stand up to the criminal syndicates in some of these countries. They have got to help our fellow Americans in distress. That is just to name a few of the dangerous tasks that they undertake. They work hard, often in very challenging, even life- threatening circumstances, so they deserve our support, which includes reforming a department that sorely needs to modernize. Mr. Speaker, the annual authorization of the Department of State is critical to maintaining congressional oversight and making these needed agency reforms. The House has passed an authorization bill in each of the last six Congresses, but, unfortunately, it has been 15 years since this legislation was signed into law. This year, we have an opportunity to break that unfortunate streak, which makes this legislation all the more important. First and foremost, the bill includes a number of critical embassy security reforms and improvements. For example, the Department will be authorized to use so-called best value criteria when contracting for local guards at U.S. facilities overseas. This is an important change. [[Page H7173]] This authority has consistently been requested by the professionals overseeing the security at our embassies and has been a particular focus of two members of the committee. So I would like to thank Lois Frankel and Randy Weber for their work. The bill requires the State Department to designate a list of high- risk, high-threat posts, effectively prioritizing the resources and the security for these posts. Now, these are the posts most at risk. The State Department and Defense Department are directed to jointly develop enhanced contingency plans. Why? Because there are going to be surprises overseas. There are going to be emergency situations, including planning for the rapid deployment of military resources to keep our personnel safe in a time of crisis. It includes provisions that improve security for the children and the families of U.S. diplomats abroad. And it makes sure that security failures, due to misconduct or due to unsatisfactory performance, are identified and those responsible are held accountable, something that did not happen when it came to the Islamist terrorist attack in Benghazi. No one lost a day of pay as a consequence of the mistakes made there. The bill increases accountability also for sexual exploitation and abuse by U.N. peacekeepers, which the Foreign Affairs Committee has helped expose through the hearings by Chairman Chris Smith. It also increases transparency for how U.S. funds are spent at the United Nations and mandates that the Department work to increase the number of American citizens employed by the United Nations. This has been a focus of Mr. Mo Brooks. We have also included important provisions to bolster the State Department's inspector general, an office that the Foreign Affairs Committee successfully fought to have filled after it sat vacant for 5 years. And lastly, the bill increases flexibility in the Department's workforce, allowing civil servants more opportunities to serve overseas and authorizing a pilot program to acquire skilled workers from the private sector. The passage of this legislation, S. 1635, would strengthen the law. It is a bipartisan bill, it improves congressional oversight of the Department, and I think it deserves unanimous support. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of this bill. Mr. Speaker, let me start by thanking my friend and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Ed Royce of California. He and I and our staffs have been working on this bill for most of the 114th Congress. This may be the last Foreign Affairs bill the House will deal with this year, and it is an appropriate capstone for the committee's work. Authorizing and overseeing the State Department is one of our committee's most important responsibilities. As the Obama administration comes to an end and we deal with the uncertainties of a transition in power, it is important that Congress help to set the tone for the future of our foreign policy. We need to do all we can to ensure the future of America's leadership role in the world. {time} 1745 This bill is also long, long overdue as the chairman pointed out. The last time the President signed a State Department authorization was in the year 2002. So much has changed since then--from the invasion of Iraq and the subsequent rise of ISIS to the ascendance of the Asia- Pacific in our foreign policy to the growing threat of climate change. Think about the way terrorist groups use social media to recruit fighters and spread propaganda. This has become a major foreign policy concern; yet the last time we passed the State Department authorization, Twitter and Facebook were still a few years from coming online. Imagine that. That is just one example. In nearly 15 years, countless issues have cropped up as new foreign policy concerns, and traditional areas of diplomacy and development have evolved. This bill will help the State Department keep pace with the changes. I would like to underscore a few provisions in this bill that I think are especially important. The main thing I want to talk about is the heart and soul of American diplomacy: our diplomats. Our diplomats are at the core of this bill. We want them to have the tools and resources for success. These men and women pursue a path of public service unlike any other, going to work--sometimes in dangerous places--as America's face to the world. Diplomats are our front line of international engagement, advancing our interests and building bridges of friendship and understanding. This is incredibly important work. It requires the right people for the job--people with the skill, training, and confidence to carry out their work. We need to do all we can to enable our diplomats to carry out diplomacy. They need to be able to get out from behind a desk and engage directly with cultures and communities, from government officials to civil society groups to everyday people on the street; so we have included provisions in this bill that are focused on the security of our Embassies and on the proper training of our personnel. We need the best possible security for our Embassies and diplomats abroad, and good security doesn't always come cheap. This bill says that, when the State Department hires local personnel to protect our diplomatic facilities and staff, they shouldn't be constrained only to take the lowest cost bid. After all, the rule is generally true that you get what you pay for, and when it comes to the safety of our diplomats, we should be focused on quality in addition to cost; so we have included a provision that calls for the best value security rather than the lowest cost. There is a lot of value in keeping our diplomats safe, and I want to thank representative Lois Frankel for her work on this provision. With this bill, we have also focused on improving the security of what we call ``soft targets,'' not typical diplomatic facilities, but things like schools and schoolbuses for the children of diplomats abroad. It is also important that the State Department reflect who we are as a country. America is made up of people from all different backgrounds and perspectives. Our diversity is one of our strengths. Our Foreign Service should benefit from that strength and reflect it back to the world. We also need to incorporate that strength into our foreign policy. A diverse workforce means a diversity of views and experiences to aid our leaders when they face tough decisions. Old ways of thinking and worn- out approaches aren't well suited to the modern range of challenges our diplomats face. This bill will push the Department to recruit, train, and retain a diverse workforce. Reports tell us that the State Department has been slow to change in these areas, so we want to give those efforts a shot in the arm. Additionally, I thank Chairman Royce for including my Western Hemisphere Drug Policy Commission legislation in this bill. The heroin epidemic in this country is getting worse and worse. We need to make sure that our drug policy is focused on saving lives. Here at home, that means doing more on prevention and treatment. Looking abroad, we need to take stock of what has worked and what hasn't when it comes to our drug policy in Latin America and the Caribbean. That is what this commission will do, and I am grateful this measure is moving forward. That idea, taking stock of our successes and failures, brings me to a few final thoughts on this bill. Even though Congress has a role in foreign policy, we are outside the day-to-day decisionmaking structures. That outside perspective gives us a chance to step back and ask: What can we be doing better? Where can we cut away dead wood? What changes going on in the world require us to change our approach? Our State Department personnel may have great new ideas about the way to advance our interests, but they are constrained by existing law or are bogged down in the constant hard work demanded of them. Let's be honest. By their nature, bureaucracies tend not to change on their own. That is when Congress needs to step in and say: ``We can help to solve this problem. We can make it easier for our diplomats to do their jobs.'' The thing is that we have [[Page H7174]] to actually do that. We should try to pass a bill like this every year. It should become the way we do business, just like the defense authorization, because when we don't, we are letting our diplomats down; we are also ceding their work to other jurisdictions, and we are missing opportunities to bolster American diplomacy and national security. Last week, we voted on the Defense Authorization Act. It included 80 provisions that fell, at least in part, under the jurisdiction of the Foreign Affairs Committee when it landed on the President's desk. I respect our friends on the Armed Services Committee a great deal, but I hear their message loud and clear, that if we don't act in our own jurisdiction, someone else will. I am encouraged that we have made it this far on this bill. I hope it becomes a regular part of our committee's work and that, a year from now, we are back here debating more good ideas about improving American diplomacy. For now, I again thank the chairman. I am glad to support this bill, and I urge all my colleagues to do the same. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith). He is the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I thank my good friend, the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Royce, for his leadership on this important bill. I thank Eliot Engel, the ranking member, and, of course, Senators Corker and Cardin. This is a true bipartisan piece of legislation. I thank my colleagues for their leadership on this. Mr. Speaker, a highly skilled group of Foreign Service Officers-- about 15,000 strong--are deployed worldwide to promote peace and human rights, to support prosperity, and to protect Americans while advancing the vital interests of the United States abroad. For most, posting overseas requires serious personal sacrifice. For some, deployment entails serious danger--from disease, crime, and terrorism. Mr. Speaker, after the American Embassies in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi were attacked by terrorists in August of 1998, I chaired hearings on Embassy security in my subcommittee and authored the Admiral James W. Nance and Meg Donovan Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 2000 and 2001 to significantly boost Embassy security, including reconfigured Embassies, setbacks--a zone that puts the street farther away from the building--and additional diplomatic security personnel. The bill, dubbed the ``Embassy Security Act,'' which passed the House in 1999, never even got a vote in the Senate; but after much lobbying, my bill was included in its entirety in the FY 2000 appropriations omnibus. In 2005, Congress enacted into law another bill I sponsored, the Department of State Authorities Act, which, among other things, boosted danger pay. Today, the Royce-Corker-Engel-Cardin bill authorizes $4.8 billion for Embassy security. It continues the all-important work of ensuring the most effective security possible for our Foreign Service and Americans abroad by directing joint DOD-State contingency plans--including the rapid deployment of Armed Forces--the designation of high-risk, high- threat posts with adequate funding and training commensurate with the danger, and the utilization of ``best value'' contracting. The bill provides numerous enhancements of personnel issues for our men and women in the Foreign Service--from promotion opportunities to updated cost-of-living adjustments to improved care of Foreign Service officers' children-dependents with autism spectrum disorders. During markup--and I thank the chair for being so gracious for supporting it--I sponsored an amendment that was approved that recognizes applied behavior analysis, or ABA, as proven evidence-based intervention for autistic children and that the Secretary of State should ensure that coverage of and access to ABA for dependents with ASD of overseas employees is provided. I travel all over the world, and I often hear from Foreign Service Officers who cannot get ABA treatment for their children. They are anguished because, if they try to go to a deployment where that is provided, it may hinder their Foreign Service careers; and, of course, they put their children first. That shouldn't be the case. There should be no choice. The children need to be supported as well as the Foreign Service Officers. The House Foreign Affairs Committee also adopted another amendment I offered during markup, which is whistleblower protections for U.N. personnel--we have had hearings on that in our subcommittee--the capacity to investigate allegations of sexual exploitation committed by peacekeepers and to hold those who commit such heinous crimes accountable. Mr. Speaker, I have traveled to places like Goma, in the DRC, where peacekeepers were raping 13-year-olds--U.N. peacekeepers. The series of hearings that we held on it found that the zero tolerance policy of the U.N. was really zero compliance. That has to improve. There have been some improvements made but far fewer than what are required. This legislation helps to push that ball significantly down that lane. Hopefully, the peacekeepers will do just that--protect. It is a duty for us to make sure that that happens. There are many other good things in this bill. Again, I thank Chairman Royce for his leadership. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, in reclaiming my time, I thank Chris Smith for his years of oversight and for his combating that type of abuse. I also thank him for our efforts to have this included now in what will become a new law. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly), my good friend and colleague on the Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. CONNOLLY. I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel), my dear friend and the distinguished ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. I rise today in support of S. 1635, the Department of State Authorities Act. There is an expression in Latin. I studied Latin for 6 years, but I rarely get to use it. It is mirabile dictu--wonderful to relate--that we are actually going to pass the State Department authorization bill. The bill is not perfect, and it is not as comprehensive as one would hope; however, it is a product of compromise under the fine leadership of Ed Royce and Eliot Engel. It is a welcome step toward the annual authorization of the State Department operations I know we will get to next year. The regular enactment of a State Department authorization is a long-neglected priority, and the clarity of our diplomacy and development missions have suffered absent one. Congress has not enacted a full State authorization bill since 2002. In a similar vein, the Foreign Assistance Act has not undergone a comprehensive reauthorization since 1985, when I was a staff member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I have introduced the Global Partnerships Act, which would do just that, and I have tried to streamline and modernize the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The bill on the floor today codifies high standards for Embassy security practices and ensures that we are making smart investments in diplomatic security. It also fights discrimination and promotes diversity within the Foreign Service. I thank the committee--and particularly our leaders, Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel--for including my amendment that requires the State Department to report on its compliance with the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act, FITARA, which is the Federal IT reform bill I introduced and wrote with Mr. Issa. I support this bill because it enables the kind of serious, credible, and ambitious diplomacy that can solve the world's most intractable challenges, and I urge my colleagues to give it their full support. Again, I congratulate our staffs--and particularly our chairman and ranking member, Mr. Royce and Mr. Engel, respectively--for their leadership in bringing this bill before us today. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. [[Page H7175]] Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am waiting for one other speaker; so, while we are waiting, let me at least partially close. I, first of all, thank Chairman Royce's staff for their hard work on this very important bill. I thank Tom Sheehy, Ed Burrier, Tom Hill, and Doug Anderson, and on my staff, Jason Steinbaum, Doug Campbell, Eric Jacobstein, Janice Kaguyutan, Sajit Gandhi, Jennifer Hendrixson White, and Mark Iozzi. We can only do as well as the wonderful staff that we have, and it is really appreciated, I know, by Chairman Royce and by me. As was said before, Mr. Speaker, every single year, Congress passes a defense authorization. It happens without fail, and it should. It is a vitally important piece of legislation, and we have an obligation to give our women and men in uniform the support and the resources they need. {time} 1800 The work of our diplomats is very different, but it is also critical to our national security. These dedicated public servants help to project stability, enhance security, and diffuse crises before they start. From a dollars-and-cents perspective, it makes a lot more sense to prevent crises than to try to stop them after they are burning out of control. We need diplomacy to succeed so that using our military remains the last resort in our foreign policy. This legislation will help ensure that our diplomacy does succeed. I hope this bill gets across the finish line soon; I hope the Senate does its job; and I hope we make a State Department authorization a yearly priority for the Foreign Affairs Committee, for the Congress, and for the American people. I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert). Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I am a big fan of Chairman Royce's work, and I appreciate all the work of the committee in these difficult areas. Sometimes in trying to bring together a big authorization bill like this, language gets inserted that can be problematic. On page 105, for example, section 713, ``Recruitment and retention of individuals who have lived, worked, or studied in predominantly Muslim countries or communities,'' we know that one of our problems when we were trying to deal with radical Islam is, number one, our President doesn't recognize radical Islam, although some of the best experts who are radical Islamists say, yes, it exists, and Muslim friends like President el- Sisi acknowledge it is a problem. For example, here in subsection C, it says: ``The Secretary shall make every effort to recruit and retain individuals that have lived, worked, or studied in predominantly Muslim countries or communities, including individuals who have studied at Islamic institutions of higher learning.'' I know this was not submitted by a Muslim--far from it--but although we desperately need people who have lived and studied in this area, to tell the Secretary of State that the Secretary shall make every effort to get people like this is the way our enemies take advantage of us. We should not be telling the Secretary to make every effort. As a former chief justice, that is the kind of thing--you have to say, well, he didn't make every effort or she didn't make every effort. We should not be coercing the State Department to hire people who--if they are not appropriate or have Muslim ties, they should not be pushed into the State Department. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, let me say in response that we should hire, in the State Department, people who do have some experience. We should have some people there with some experience with Muslim culture and Muslim countries, with that kind of a background. But that said, we want to work with the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) on implementation of this bill to make certain that these concerns are handled. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Frankel). Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel, first, for the great bipartisan work. I really appreciate being on this committee. I want to tell you a story that one of our Ambassadors told me that I thought was amazing. I won't say her name or where she was, but she told me she was overseas. The security that they hired was so poor that they actually had to hire criminals; and her security guard not only robbed her and her family, but killed their dog. That is just an example of some of the quality of security that we had for our Ambassadors, who deserve absolutely our utmost protection. So I just want to thank both the chairman and the ranking member for working with me to get this provision in this bill that now is going to let our State Department get well-qualified security for Embassies, which they deserve to have. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to thank the gentlewoman from Florida for her contribution to this legislation. Mr. Speaker, as chairman, I also want to thank our ranking member, Mr. Engel. I want to thank all my committee colleagues for their contributions to this bill. I think we should take the opportunity to thank our counterparts, Senator Corker and Senator Cardin, in the Senate for working with us to bring the first State authorization bill to the President's desk in over 15 years. Today, the Department is considering how to deploy diplomats in high- threat, high-risk places like South Sudan, like the Central African Republic, Yemen, Libya. It is our responsibility to make sure that U.S. personnel at these posts have every available means of protection, and this bill authorizes the Department to make critical upgrades in Embassy security. This bill also mandates that the Department uses leverage at the United Nations to make improvements that have been ignored for too long. In just the last year, we have heard horrific stories of peacekeepers sexually abusing and exploiting those they are sent to protect. Sadly, these are not the first instances of such predatory behavior, but the United Nations has failed to take steps to stop it. Oversight is necessary at any agency. It took 5 years for the Department's inspector general position to be filled, and this bill makes sure that the Department's watchdog has all the tools it needs to perform its mandate. This bill deserves our support. The other body should move quickly so that these critical reforms can be signed into law by the President. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 1635, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [House] [Pages H7160-H7175] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEPARTMENT OF STATE OPERATIONS AUTHORIZATION AND EMBASSY SECURITY ACT, FISCAL YEAR 2016 Mr. ROYCE.

No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act and the amendments made by this Act. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. General Leave Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the ranking member of this committee, Mr. Eliot Engel, for his work on this important piece of legislation to protect U.S. personnel overseas, to improve the oversight of the Department of State, and to modernize its workforce. And I would also like to thank the other members of the committee for their input as well on this legislation. The world is not getting any easier for the men and women serving overseas who represent this country at the Department of State. These men and women work with many other agencies, including the Defense Department. They have got a wide range of very important responsibilities. They try to broker peace agreements. And, of course, not everybody wants peace in these agreements. They have to fight human trafficking. In other words, they have got to stand up to the criminal syndicates in some of these countries. They have got to help our fellow Americans in distress. That is just to name a few of the dangerous tasks that they undertake. They work hard, often in very challenging, even life- threatening circumstances, so they deserve our support, which includes reforming a department that sorely needs to modernize. Mr. Speaker, the annual authorization of the Department of State is critical to maintaining congressional oversight and making these needed agency reforms. The House has passed an authorization bill in each of the last six Congresses, but, unfortunately, it has been 15 years since this legislation was signed into law. This year, we have an opportunity to break that unfortunate streak, which makes this legislation all the more important. First and foremost, the bill includes a number of critical embassy security reforms and improvements. For example, the Department will be authorized to use so-called best value criteria when contracting for local guards at U.S. facilities overseas. This is an important change. [[Page H7173]] This authority has consistently been requested by the professionals overseeing the security at our embassies and has been a particular focus of two members of the committee. So I would like to thank Lois Frankel and Randy Weber for their work. The bill requires the State Department to designate a list of high- risk, high-threat posts, effectively prioritizing the resources and the security for these posts. Now, these are the posts most at risk. The State Department and Defense Department are directed to jointly develop enhanced contingency plans. Why? Because there are going to be surprises overseas. There are going to be emergency situations, including planning for the rapid deployment of military resources to keep our personnel safe in a time of crisis. It includes provisions that improve security for the children and the families of U.S. diplomats abroad. And it makes sure that security failures, due to misconduct or due to unsatisfactory performance, are identified and those responsible are held accountable, something that did not happen when it came to the Islamist terrorist attack in Benghazi. No one lost a day of pay as a consequence of the mistakes made there. The bill increases accountability also for sexual exploitation and abuse by U.N. peacekeepers, which the Foreign Affairs Committee has helped expose through the hearings by Chairman Chris Smith. It also increases transparency for how U.S. funds are spent at the United Nations and mandates that the Department work to increase the number of American citizens employed by the United Nations. This has been a focus of Mr. Mo Brooks. We have also included important provisions to bolster the State Department's inspector general, an office that the Foreign Affairs Committee successfully fought to have filled after it sat vacant for 5 years. And lastly, the bill increases flexibility in the Department's workforce, allowing civil servants more opportunities to serve overseas and authorizing a pilot program to acquire skilled workers from the private sector. The passage of this legislation, S. 1635, would strengthen the law. It is a bipartisan bill, it improves congressional oversight of the Department, and I think it deserves unanimous support. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of this bill. Mr. Speaker, let me start by thanking my friend and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Ed Royce of California. He and I and our staffs have been working on this bill for most of the 114th Congress. This may be the last Foreign Affairs bill the House will deal with this year, and it is an appropriate capstone for the committee's work. Authorizing and overseeing the State Department is one of our committee's most important responsibilities. As the Obama administration comes to an end and we deal with the uncertainties of a transition in power, it is important that Congress help to set the tone for the future of our foreign policy. We need to do all we can to ensure the future of America's leadership role in the world. {time} 1745 This bill is also long, long overdue as the chairman pointed out. The last time the President signed a State Department authorization was in the year 2002. So much has changed since then--from the invasion of Iraq and the subsequent rise of ISIS to the ascendance of the Asia- Pacific in our foreign policy to the growing threat of climate change. Think about the way terrorist groups use social media to recruit fighters and spread propaganda. This has become a major foreign policy concern; yet the last time we passed the State Department authorization, Twitter and Facebook were still a few years from coming online. Imagine that. That is just one example. In nearly 15 years, countless issues have cropped up as new foreign policy concerns, and traditional areas of diplomacy and development have evolved. This bill will help the State Department keep pace with the changes. I would like to underscore a few provisions in this bill that I think are especially important. The main thing I want to talk about is the heart and soul of American diplomacy: our diplomats. Our diplomats are at the core of this bill. We want them to have the tools and resources for success. These men and women pursue a path of public service unlike any other, going to work--sometimes in dangerous places--as America's face to the world. Diplomats are our front line of international engagement, advancing our interests and building bridges of friendship and understanding. This is incredibly important work. It requires the right people for the job--people with the skill, training, and confidence to carry out their work. We need to do all we can to enable our diplomats to carry out diplomacy. They need to be able to get out from behind a desk and engage directly with cultures and communities, from government officials to civil society groups to everyday people on the street; so we have included provisions in this bill that are focused on the security of our Embassies and on the proper training of our personnel. We need the best possible security for our Embassies and diplomats abroad, and good security doesn't always come cheap. This bill says that, when the State Department hires local personnel to protect our diplomatic facilities and staff, they shouldn't be constrained only to take the lowest cost bid. After all, the rule is generally true that you get what you pay for, and when it comes to the safety of our diplomats, we should be focused on quality in addition to cost; so we have included a provision that calls for the best value security rather than the lowest cost. There is a lot of value in keeping our diplomats safe, and I want to thank representative Lois Frankel for her work on this provision. With this bill, we have also focused on improving the security of what we call ``soft targets,'' not typical diplomatic facilities, but things like schools and schoolbuses for the children of diplomats abroad. It is also important that the State Department reflect who we are as a country. America is made up of people from all different backgrounds and perspectives. Our diversity is one of our strengths. Our Foreign Service should benefit from that strength and reflect it back to the world. We also need to incorporate that strength into our foreign policy. A diverse workforce means a diversity of views and experiences to aid our leaders when they face tough decisions. Old ways of thinking and worn- out approaches aren't well suited to the modern range of challenges our diplomats face. This bill will push the Department to recruit, train, and retain a diverse workforce. Reports tell us that the State Department has been slow to change in these areas, so we want to give those efforts a shot in the arm. Additionally, I thank Chairman Royce for including my Western Hemisphere Drug Policy Commission legislation in this bill. The heroin epidemic in this country is getting worse and worse. We need to make sure that our drug policy is focused on saving lives. Here at home, that means doing more on prevention and treatment. Looking abroad, we need to take stock of what has worked and what hasn't when it comes to our drug policy in Latin America and the Caribbean. That is what this commission will do, and I am grateful this measure is moving forward. That idea, taking stock of our successes and failures, brings me to a few final thoughts on this bill. Even though Congress has a role in foreign policy, we are outside the day-to-day decisionmaking structures. That outside perspective gives us a chance to step back and ask: What can we be doing better? Where can we cut away dead wood? What changes going on in the world require us to change our approach? Our State Department personnel may have great new ideas about the way to advance our interests, but they are constrained by existing law or are bogged down in the constant hard work demanded of them. Let's be honest. By their nature, bureaucracies tend not to change on their own. That is when Congress needs to step in and say: ``We can help to solve this problem. We can make it easier for our diplomats to do their jobs.'' The thing is that we have [[Page H7174]] to actually do that. We should try to pass a bill like this every year. It should become the way we do business, just like the defense authorization, because when we don't, we are letting our diplomats down; we are also ceding their work to other jurisdictions, and we are missing opportunities to bolster American diplomacy and national security. Last week, we voted on the Defense Authorization Act. It included 80 provisions that fell, at least in part, under the jurisdiction of the Foreign Affairs Committee when it landed on the President's desk. I respect our friends on the Armed Services Committee a great deal, but I hear their message loud and clear, that if we don't act in our own jurisdiction, someone else will. I am encouraged that we have made it this far on this bill. I hope it becomes a regular part of our committee's work and that, a year from now, we are back here debating more good ideas about improving American diplomacy. For now, I again thank the chairman. I am glad to support this bill, and I urge all my colleagues to do the same. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith). He is the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I thank my good friend, the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Royce, for his leadership on this important bill. I thank Eliot Engel, the ranking member, and, of course, Senators Corker and Cardin. This is a true bipartisan piece of legislation. I thank my colleagues for their leadership on this. Mr. Speaker, a highly skilled group of Foreign Service Officers-- about 15,000 strong--are deployed worldwide to promote peace and human rights, to support prosperity, and to protect Americans while advancing the vital interests of the United States abroad. For most, posting overseas requires serious personal sacrifice. For some, deployment entails serious danger--from disease, crime, and terrorism. Mr. Speaker, after the American Embassies in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi were attacked by terrorists in August of 1998, I chaired hearings on Embassy security in my subcommittee and authored the Admiral James W. Nance and Meg Donovan Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 2000 and 2001 to significantly boost Embassy security, including reconfigured Embassies, setbacks--a zone that puts the street farther away from the building--and additional diplomatic security personnel. The bill, dubbed the ``Embassy Security Act,'' which passed the House in 1999, never even got a vote in the Senate; but after much lobbying, my bill was included in its entirety in the FY 2000 appropriations omnibus. In 2005, Congress enacted into law another bill I sponsored, the Department of State Authorities Act, which, among other things, boosted danger pay. Today, the Royce-Corker-Engel-Cardin bill authorizes $4.8 billion for Embassy security. It continues the all-important work of ensuring the most effective security possible for our Foreign Service and Americans abroad by directing joint DOD-State contingency plans--including the rapid deployment of Armed Forces--the designation of high-risk, high- threat posts with adequate funding and training commensurate with the danger, and the utilization of ``best value'' contracting. The bill provides numerous enhancements of personnel issues for our men and women in the Foreign Service--from promotion opportunities to updated cost-of-living adjustments to improved care of Foreign Service officers' children-dependents with autism spectrum disorders. During markup--and I thank the chair for being so gracious for supporting it--I sponsored an amendment that was approved that recognizes applied behavior analysis, or ABA, as proven evidence-based intervention for autistic children and that the Secretary of State should ensure that coverage of and access to ABA for dependents with ASD of overseas employees is provided. I travel all over the world, and I often hear from Foreign Service Officers who cannot get ABA treatment for their children. They are anguished because, if they try to go to a deployment where that is provided, it may hinder their Foreign Service careers; and, of course, they put their children first. That shouldn't be the case. There should be no choice. The children need to be supported as well as the Foreign Service Officers. The House Foreign Affairs Committee also adopted another amendment I offered during markup, which is whistleblower protections for U.N. personnel--we have had hearings on that in our subcommittee--the capacity to investigate allegations of sexual exploitation committed by peacekeepers and to hold those who commit such heinous crimes accountable. Mr. Speaker, I have traveled to places like Goma, in the DRC, where peacekeepers were raping 13-year-olds--U.N. peacekeepers. The series of hearings that we held on it found that the zero tolerance policy of the U.N. was really zero compliance. That has to improve. There have been some improvements made but far fewer than what are required. This legislation helps to push that ball significantly down that lane. Hopefully, the peacekeepers will do just that--protect. It is a duty for us to make sure that that happens. There are many other good things in this bill. Again, I thank Chairman Royce for his leadership. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, in reclaiming my time, I thank Chris Smith for his years of oversight and for his combating that type of abuse. I also thank him for our efforts to have this included now in what will become a new law. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly), my good friend and colleague on the Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. CONNOLLY. I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel), my dear friend and the distinguished ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. I rise today in support of S. 1635, the Department of State Authorities Act. There is an expression in Latin. I studied Latin for 6 years, but I rarely get to use it. It is mirabile dictu--wonderful to relate--that we are actually going to pass the State Department authorization bill. The bill is not perfect, and it is not as comprehensive as one would hope; however, it is a product of compromise under the fine leadership of Ed Royce and Eliot Engel. It is a welcome step toward the annual authorization of the State Department operations I know we will get to next year. The regular enactment of a State Department authorization is a long-neglected priority, and the clarity of our diplomacy and development missions have suffered absent one. Congress has not enacted a full State authorization bill since 2002. In a similar vein, the Foreign Assistance Act has not undergone a comprehensive reauthorization since 1985, when I was a staff member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I have introduced the Global Partnerships Act, which would do just that, and I have tried to streamline and modernize the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The bill on the floor today codifies high standards for Embassy security practices and ensures that we are making smart investments in diplomatic security. It also fights discrimination and promotes diversity within the Foreign Service. I thank the committee--and particularly our leaders, Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel--for including my amendment that requires the State Department to report on its compliance with the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act, FITARA, which is the Federal IT reform bill I introduced and wrote with Mr. Issa. I support this bill because it enables the kind of serious, credible, and ambitious diplomacy that can solve the world's most intractable challenges, and I urge my colleagues to give it their full support. Again, I congratulate our staffs--and particularly our chairman and ranking member, Mr. Royce and Mr. Engel, respectively--for their leadership in bringing this bill before us today. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. [[Page H7175]] Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am waiting for one other speaker; so, while we are waiting, let me at least partially close. I, first of all, thank Chairman Royce's staff for their hard work on this very important bill. I thank Tom Sheehy, Ed Burrier, Tom Hill, and Doug Anderson, and on my staff, Jason Steinbaum, Doug Campbell, Eric Jacobstein, Janice Kaguyutan, Sajit Gandhi, Jennifer Hendrixson White, and Mark Iozzi. We can only do as well as the wonderful staff that we have, and it is really appreciated, I know, by Chairman Royce and by me. As was said before, Mr. Speaker, every single year, Congress passes a defense authorization. It happens without fail, and it should. It is a vitally important piece of legislation, and we have an obligation to give our women and men in uniform the support and the resources they need. {time} 1800 The work of our diplomats is very different, but it is also critical to our national security. These dedicated public servants help to project stability, enhance security, and diffuse crises before they start. From a dollars-and-cents perspective, it makes a lot more sense to prevent crises than to try to stop them after they are burning out of control. We need diplomacy to succeed so that using our military remains the last resort in our foreign policy. This legislation will help ensure that our diplomacy does succeed. I hope this bill gets across the finish line soon; I hope the Senate does its job; and I hope we make a State Department authorization a yearly priority for the Foreign Affairs Committee, for the Congress, and for the American people. I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert). Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I am a big fan of Chairman Royce's work, and I appreciate all the work of the committee in these difficult areas. Sometimes in trying to bring together a big authorization bill like this, language gets inserted that can be problematic. On page 105, for example, section 713, ``Recruitment and retention of individuals who have lived, worked, or studied in predominantly Muslim countries or communities,'' we know that one of our problems when we were trying to deal with radical Islam is, number one, our President doesn't recognize radical Islam, although some of the best experts who are radical Islamists say, yes, it exists, and Muslim friends like President el- Sisi acknowledge it is a problem. For example, here in subsection C, it says: ``The Secretary shall make every effort to recruit and retain individuals that have lived, worked, or studied in predominantly Muslim countries or communities, including individuals who have studied at Islamic institutions of higher learning.'' I know this was not submitted by a Muslim--far from it--but although we desperately need people who have lived and studied in this area, to tell the Secretary of State that the Secretary shall make every effort to get people like this is the way our enemies take advantage of us. We should not be telling the Secretary to make every effort. As a former chief justice, that is the kind of thing--you have to say, well, he didn't make every effort or she didn't make every effort. We should not be coercing the State Department to hire people who--if they are not appropriate or have Muslim ties, they should not be pushed into the State Department. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, let me say in response that we should hire, in the State Department, people who do have some experience. We should have some people there with some experience with Muslim culture and Muslim countries, with that kind of a background. But that said, we want to work with the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) on implementation of this bill to make certain that these concerns are handled. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Frankel). Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel, first, for the great bipartisan work. I really appreciate being on this committee. I want to tell you a story that one of our Ambassadors told me that I thought was amazing. I won't say her name or where she was, but she told me she was overseas. The security that they hired was so poor that they actually had to hire criminals; and her security guard not only robbed her and her family, but killed their dog. That is just an example of some of the quality of security that we had for our Ambassadors, who deserve absolutely our utmost protection. So I just want to thank both the chairman and the ranking member for working with me to get this provision in this bill that now is going to let our State Department get well-qualified security for Embassies, which they deserve to have. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to thank the gentlewoman from Florida for her contribution to this legislation. Mr. Speaker, as chairman, I also want to thank our ranking member, Mr. Engel. I want to thank all my committee colleagues for their contributions to this bill. I think we should take the opportunity to thank our counterparts, Senator Corker and Senator Cardin, in the Senate for working with us to bring the first State authorization bill to the President's desk in over 15 years. Today, the Department is considering how to deploy diplomats in high- threat, high-risk places like South Sudan, like the Central African Republic, Yemen, Libya. It is our responsibility to make sure that U.S. personnel at these posts have every available means of protection, and this bill authorizes the Department to make critical upgrades in Embassy security. This bill also mandates that the Department uses leverage at the United Nations to make improvements that have been ignored for too long. In just the last year, we have heard horrific stories of peacekeepers sexually abusing and exploiting those they are sent to protect. Sadly, these are not the first instances of such predatory behavior, but the United Nations has failed to take steps to stop it. Oversight is necessary at any agency. It took 5 years for the Department's inspector general position to be filled, and this bill makes sure that the Department's watchdog has all the tools it needs to perform its mandate. This bill deserves our support. The other body should move quickly so that these critical reforms can be signed into law by the President. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 1635, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________",package_114_212.csv,143077,143077,143147,"[congressional record volume 162, number 174 (monday, december 5, 2016)] [house] [pages h7160-h7175] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] department of state operations authorization and embassy security act, fiscal year 2016 mr. royce. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (s. 1635) to authorize the department of state for fiscal year 2016, and for other purposes, as amended. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: s. 1635 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title; table of contents.

(5) subsection (c) of section 601 of the foreign service act of 1980 (22 u.s.c. 4001) is amended by striking paragraphs (4) and (5). sec. 716. prohibition on additional funding. no additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this act and the amendments made by this act. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from california (mr. royce) and the gentleman from new york (mr. engel) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from california. general leave mr. royce. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on this bill. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from california? there was no objection. mr. royce. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i would like to thank the ranking member of this committee, mr. eliot engel, for his work on this important piece of legislation to protect u.s. personnel overseas, to improve the oversight of the department of state, and to modernize its workforce. and i would also like to thank the other members of the committee for their input as well on this legislation. the world is not getting any easier for the men and women serving overseas who represent this country at the department of state. these men and women work with many other agencies, including the defense department. they have got a wide range of very important responsibilities. they try to broker peace agreements. and, of course, not everybody wants peace in these agreements. they have to fight human trafficking. in other words, they have got to stand up to the criminal syndicates in some of these countries. they have got to help our fellow americans in distress. that is just to name a few of the dangerous tasks that they undertake. they work hard, often in very challenging, even life- threatening circumstances, so they deserve our support, which includes reforming a department that sorely needs to modernize. mr. speaker, the annual authorization of the department of state is critical to maintaining congressional oversight and making these needed agency reforms. the house has passed an authorization bill in each of the last six congresses, but, unfortunately, it has been 15 years since this legislation was signed into law. this year, we have an opportunity to break that unfortunate streak, which makes this legislation all the more important. first and foremost, the bill includes a number of critical embassy security reforms and improvements. for example, the department will be authorized to use so-called best value criteria when contracting for local guards at u.s. facilities overseas. this is an important change. [[page h7173]] this authority has consistently been requested by the professionals overseeing the security at our embassies and has been a particular focus of two members of the committee. so i would like to thank lois frankel and randy weber for their work. the bill requires the state department to designate a list of high- risk, high-threat posts, effectively prioritizing the resources and the security for these posts. now, these are the posts most at risk. the state department and defense department are directed to jointly develop enhanced contingency plans. why? because there are going to be surprises overseas. there are going to be emergency situations, including planning for the rapid deployment of military resources to keep our personnel safe in a time of crisis. it includes provisions that improve security for the children and the families of u.s. diplomats abroad. and it makes sure that security failures, due to misconduct or due to unsatisfactory performance, are identified and those responsible are held accountable, something that did not happen when it came to the islamist terrorist attack in benghazi. no one lost a day of pay as a consequence of the mistakes made there. the bill increases accountability also for sexual exploitation and abuse by u.n. peacekeepers, which the foreign affairs committee has helped expose through the hearings by chairman chris smith. it also increases transparency for how u.s. funds are spent at the united nations and mandates that the department work to increase the number of american citizens employed by the united nations. this has been a focus of mr. mo brooks. we have also included important provisions to bolster the state department's inspector general, an office that the foreign affairs committee successfully fought to have filled after it sat vacant for 5 years. and lastly, the bill increases flexibility in the department's workforce, allowing civil servants more opportunities to serve overseas and authorizing a pilot program to acquire skilled workers from the private sector. the passage of this legislation, s. 1635, would strengthen the law. it is a bipartisan bill, it improves congressional oversight of the department, and i think it deserves unanimous support. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. engel. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i rise in support of this bill. mr. speaker, let me start by thanking my friend and the chairman of the foreign affairs committee, ed royce of california. he and i and our staffs have been working on this bill for most of the 114th congress. this may be the last foreign affairs bill the house will deal with this year, and it is an appropriate capstone for the committee's work. authorizing and overseeing the state department is one of our committee's most important responsibilities. as the obama administration comes to an end and we deal with the uncertainties of a transition in power, it is important that congress help to set the tone for the future of our foreign policy. we need to do all we can to ensure the future of america's leadership role in the world. {time} 1745 this bill is also long, long overdue as the chairman pointed out. the last time the president signed a state department authorization was in the year 2002. so much has changed since then--from the invasion of iraq and the subsequent rise of isis to the ascendance of the asia- pacific in our foreign policy to the growing threat of climate change. think about the way terrorist groups use social media to recruit fighters and spread propaganda. this has become a major foreign policy concern; yet the last time we passed the state department authorization, twitter and facebook were still a few years from coming online. imagine that. that is just one example. in nearly 15 years, countless issues have cropped up as new foreign policy concerns, and traditional areas of diplomacy and development have evolved. this bill will help the state department keep pace with the changes. i would like to underscore a few provisions in this bill that i think are especially important. the main thing i want to talk about is the heart and soul of american diplomacy: our diplomats. our diplomats are at the core of this bill. we want them to have the tools and resources for success. these men and women pursue a path of public service unlike any other, going to work--sometimes in dangerous places--as america's face to the world. diplomats are our front line of international engagement, advancing our interests and building bridges of friendship and understanding. this is incredibly important work. it requires the right people for the job--people with the skill, training, and confidence to carry out their work. we need to do all we can to enable our diplomats to carry out diplomacy. they need to be able to get out from behind a desk and engage directly with cultures and communities, from government officials to civil society groups to everyday people on the street; so we have included provisions in this bill that are focused on the security of our embassies and on the proper training of our personnel. we need the best possible security for our embassies and diplomats abroad, and good security doesn't always come cheap. this bill says that, when the state department hires local personnel to protect our diplomatic facilities and staff, they shouldn't be constrained only to take the lowest cost bid. after all, the rule is generally true that you get what you pay for, and when it comes to the safety of our diplomats, we should be focused on quality in addition to cost; so we have included a provision that calls for the best value security rather than the lowest cost. there is a lot of value in keeping our diplomats safe, and i want to thank representative lois frankel for her work on this provision. with this bill, we have also focused on improving the security of what we call ``soft targets,'' not typical diplomatic facilities, but things like schools and schoolbuses for the children of diplomats abroad. it is also important that the state department reflect who we are as a country. america is made up of people from all different backgrounds and perspectives. our diversity is one of our strengths. our foreign service should benefit from that strength and reflect it back to the world. we also need to incorporate that strength into our foreign policy. a diverse workforce means a diversity of views and experiences to aid our leaders when they face tough decisions. old ways of thinking and worn- out approaches aren't well suited to the modern range of challenges our diplomats face. this bill will push the department to recruit, train, and retain a diverse workforce. reports tell us that the state department has been slow to change in these areas, so we want to give those efforts a shot in the arm. additionally, i thank chairman royce for including my western hemisphere drug policy commission legislation in this bill. the heroin epidemic in this country is getting worse and worse. we need to make sure that our drug policy is focused on saving lives. here at home, that means doing more on prevention and treatment. looking abroad, we need to take stock of what has worked and what hasn't when it comes to our drug policy in latin america and the caribbean. that is what this commission will do, and i am grateful this measure is moving forward. that idea, taking stock of our successes and failures, brings me to a few final thoughts on this bill. even though congress has a role in foreign policy, we are outside the day-to-day decisionmaking structures. that outside perspective gives us a chance to step back and ask: what can we be doing better? where can we cut away dead wood? what changes going on in the world require us to change our approach? our state department personnel may have great new ideas about the way to advance our interests, but they are constrained by existing law or are bogged down in the constant hard work demanded of them. let's be honest. by their nature, bureaucracies tend not to change on their own. that is when congress needs to step in and say: ``we can help to solve this problem. we can make it easier for our diplomats to do their jobs.'' the thing is that we have [[page h7174]] to actually do that. we should try to pass a bill like this every year. it should become the way we do business, just like the defense authorization, because when we don't, we are letting our diplomats down; we are also ceding their work to other jurisdictions, and we are missing opportunities to bolster american diplomacy and national security. last week, we voted on the defense authorization act. it included 80 provisions that fell, at least in part, under the jurisdiction of the foreign affairs committee when it landed on the president's desk. i respect our friends on the armed services committee a great deal, but i hear their message loud and clear, that if we don't act in our own jurisdiction, someone else will. i am encouraged that we have made it this far on this bill. i hope it becomes a regular part of our committee's work and that, a year from now, we are back here debating more good ideas about improving american diplomacy. for now, i again thank the chairman. i am glad to support this bill, and i urge all my colleagues to do the same. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. royce. mr. speaker, i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from new jersey (mr. smith). he is the chairman of the foreign affairs subcommittee on africa, global health, global human rights, and international organizations. mr. smith of new jersey. i thank my good friend, the distinguished chairman of the foreign affairs committee, mr. royce, for his leadership on this important bill. i thank eliot engel, the ranking member, and, of course, senators corker and cardin. this is a true bipartisan piece of legislation. i thank my colleagues for their leadership on this. mr. speaker, a highly skilled group of foreign service officers-- about 15,000 strong--are deployed worldwide to promote peace and human rights, to support prosperity, and to protect americans while advancing the vital interests of the united states abroad. for most, posting overseas requires serious personal sacrifice. for some, deployment entails serious danger--from disease, crime, and terrorism. mr. speaker, after the american embassies in dar es salaam and nairobi were attacked by terrorists in august of 1998, i chaired hearings on embassy security in my subcommittee and authored the admiral james w. nance and meg donovan foreign relations authorization act of 2000 and 2001 to significantly boost embassy security, including reconfigured embassies, setbacks--a zone that puts the street farther away from the building--and additional diplomatic security personnel. the bill, dubbed the ``embassy security act,'' which passed the house in 1999, never even got a vote in the senate; but after much lobbying, my bill was included in its entirety in the fy 2000 appropriations omnibus. in 2005, congress enacted into law another bill i sponsored, the department of state authorities act, which, among other things, boosted danger pay. today, the royce-corker-engel-cardin bill authorizes $4.8 billion for embassy security. it continues the all-important work of ensuring the most effective security possible for our foreign service and americans abroad by directing joint dod-state contingency plans--including the rapid deployment of armed forces--the designation of high-risk, high- threat posts with adequate funding and training commensurate with the danger, and the utilization of ``best value'' contracting. the bill provides numerous enhancements of personnel issues for our men and women in the foreign service--from promotion opportunities to updated cost-of-living adjustments to improved care of foreign service officers' children-dependents with autism spectrum disorders. during markup--and i thank the chair for being so gracious for supporting it--i sponsored an amendment that was approved that recognizes applied behavior analysis, or aba, as proven evidence-based intervention for autistic children and that the secretary of state should ensure that coverage of and access to aba for dependents with asd of overseas employees is provided. i travel all over the world, and i often hear from foreign service officers who cannot get aba treatment for their children. they are anguished because, if they try to go to a deployment where that is provided, it may hinder their foreign service careers; and, of course, they put their children first. that shouldn't be the case. there should be no choice. the children need to be supported as well as the foreign service officers. the house foreign affairs committee also adopted another amendment i offered during markup, which is whistleblower protections for u.n. personnel--we have had hearings on that in our subcommittee--the capacity to investigate allegations of sexual exploitation committed by peacekeepers and to hold those who commit such heinous crimes accountable. mr. speaker, i have traveled to places like goma, in the drc, where peacekeepers were raping 13-year-olds--u.n. peacekeepers. the series of hearings that we held on it found that the zero tolerance policy of the u.n. was really zero compliance. that has to improve. there have been some improvements made but far fewer than what are required. this legislation helps to push that ball significantly down that lane. hopefully, the peacekeepers will do just that--protect. it is a duty for us to make sure that that happens. there are many other good things in this bill. again, i thank chairman royce for his leadership. mr. royce. mr. speaker, in reclaiming my time, i thank chris smith for his years of oversight and for his combating that type of abuse. i also thank him for our efforts to have this included now in what will become a new law. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. engel. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from virginia (mr. connolly), my good friend and colleague on the foreign affairs committee. mr. connolly. i thank the gentleman from new york (mr. engel), my dear friend and the distinguished ranking member of the house foreign affairs committee. i rise today in support of s. 1635, the department of state authorities act. there is an expression in latin. i studied latin for 6 years, but i rarely get to use it. it is mirabile dictu--wonderful to relate--that we are actually going to pass the state department authorization bill. the bill is not perfect, and it is not as comprehensive as one would hope; however, it is a product of compromise under the fine leadership of ed royce and eliot engel. it is a welcome step toward the annual authorization of the state department operations i know we will get to next year. the regular enactment of a state department authorization is a long-neglected priority, and the clarity of our diplomacy and development missions have suffered absent one. congress has not enacted a full state authorization bill since 2002. in a similar vein, the foreign assistance act has not undergone a comprehensive reauthorization since 1985, when i was a staff member on the senate foreign relations committee. i have introduced the global partnerships act, which would do just that, and i have tried to streamline and modernize the foreign assistance act of 1961. the bill on the floor today codifies high standards for embassy security practices and ensures that we are making smart investments in diplomatic security. it also fights discrimination and promotes diversity within the foreign service. i thank the committee--and particularly our leaders, chairman royce and ranking member engel--for including my amendment that requires the state department to report on its compliance with the federal information technology acquisition reform act, fitara, which is the federal it reform bill i introduced and wrote with mr. issa. i support this bill because it enables the kind of serious, credible, and ambitious diplomacy that can solve the world's most intractable challenges, and i urge my colleagues to give it their full support. again, i congratulate our staffs--and particularly our chairman and ranking member, mr. royce and mr. engel, respectively--for their leadership in bringing this bill before us today. mr. royce. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. [[page h7175]] mr. engel. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i am waiting for one other speaker; so, while we are waiting, let me at least partially close. i, first of all, thank chairman royce's staff for their hard work on this very important bill. i thank tom sheehy, ed burrier, tom hill, and doug anderson, and on my staff, jason steinbaum, doug campbell, eric jacobstein, janice kaguyutan, sajit gandhi, jennifer hendrixson white, and mark iozzi. we can only do as well as the wonderful staff that we have, and it is really appreciated, i know, by chairman royce and by me. as was said before, mr. speaker, every single year, congress passes a defense authorization. it happens without fail, and it should. it is a vitally important piece of legislation, and we have an obligation to give our women and men in uniform the support and the resources they need. {time} 1800 the work of our diplomats is very different, but it is also critical to our national security. these dedicated public servants help to project stability, enhance security, and diffuse crises before they start. from a dollars-and-cents perspective, it makes a lot more sense to prevent crises than to try to stop them after they are burning out of control. we need diplomacy to succeed so that using our military remains the last resort in our foreign policy. this legislation will help ensure that our diplomacy does succeed. i hope this bill gets across the finish line soon; i hope the senate does its job; and i hope we make a state department authorization a yearly priority for the foreign affairs committee, for the congress, and for the american people. i urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. royce. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from texas (mr. gohmert). mr. gohmert. mr. speaker, i am a big fan of chairman royce's work, and i appreciate all the work of the committee in these difficult areas. sometimes in trying to bring together a big authorization bill like this, language gets inserted that can be problematic. on page 105, for example, section 713, ``recruitment and retention of individuals who have lived, worked, or studied in predominantly muslim countries or communities,'' we know that one of our problems when we were trying to deal with radical islam is, number one, our president doesn't recognize radical islam, although some of the best experts who are radical islamists say, yes, it exists, and muslim friends like president el- sisi acknowledge it is a problem. for example, here in subsection c, it says: ``the secretary shall make every effort to recruit and retain individuals that have lived, worked, or studied in predominantly muslim countries or communities, including individuals who have studied at islamic institutions of higher learning.'' i know this was not submitted by a muslim--far from it--but although we desperately need people who have lived and studied in this area, to tell the secretary of state that the secretary shall make every effort to get people like this is the way our enemies take advantage of us. we should not be telling the secretary to make every effort. as a former chief justice, that is the kind of thing--you have to say, well, he didn't make every effort or she didn't make every effort. we should not be coercing the state department to hire people who--if they are not appropriate or have muslim ties, they should not be pushed into the state department. mr. royce. mr. speaker, let me say in response that we should hire, in the state department, people who do have some experience. we should have some people there with some experience with muslim culture and muslim countries, with that kind of a background. but that said, we want to work with the gentleman from texas (mr. gohmert) on implementation of this bill to make certain that these concerns are handled. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from florida (ms. frankel). ms. frankel of florida. mr. speaker, i thank chairman royce and ranking member engel, first, for the great bipartisan work. i really appreciate being on this committee. i want to tell you a story that one of our ambassadors told me that i thought was amazing. i won't say her name or where she was, but she told me she was overseas. the security that they hired was so poor that they actually had to hire criminals; and her security guard not only robbed her and her family, but killed their dog. that is just an example of some of the quality of security that we had for our ambassadors, who deserve absolutely our utmost protection. so i just want to thank both the chairman and the ranking member for working with me to get this provision in this bill that now is going to let our state department get well-qualified security for embassies, which they deserve to have. mr. royce. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i want to thank the gentlewoman from florida for her contribution to this legislation. mr. speaker, as chairman, i also want to thank our ranking member, mr. engel. i want to thank all my committee colleagues for their contributions to this bill. i think we should take the opportunity to thank our counterparts, senator corker and senator cardin, in the senate for working with us to bring the first state authorization bill to the president's desk in over 15 years. today, the department is considering how to deploy diplomats in high- threat, high-risk places like south sudan, like the central african republic, yemen, libya. it is our responsibility to make sure that u.s. personnel at these posts have every available means of protection, and this bill authorizes the department to make critical upgrades in embassy security. this bill also mandates that the department uses leverage at the united nations to make improvements that have been ignored for too long. in just the last year, we have heard horrific stories of peacekeepers sexually abusing and exploiting those they are sent to protect. sadly, these are not the first instances of such predatory behavior, but the united nations has failed to take steps to stop it. oversight is necessary at any agency. it took 5 years for the department's inspector general position to be filled, and this bill makes sure that the department's watchdog has all the tools it needs to perform its mandate. this bill deserves our support. the other body should move quickly so that these critical reforms can be signed into law by the president. i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from california (mr. royce) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, s. 1635, as amended. the question was taken. the speaker pro tempore. in the opinion of the chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. mr. gohmert. mr. speaker, on that i demand the yeas and nays. the yeas and nays were ordered. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to clause 8 of rule xx, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________",143077

The State Theatre first opened as a movie house for Warner Bros. Pictures on October 15, 1938, showing ``The Sisters,'' starring Errol Flynn and Bette Davis. Closing in 2001, the theatre building was extensively refurbished and reopened in December 2006, as a state-of-the-art venue for theatre, dance, music, film, concerts, and other regional and international performances. Today, The State Theatre is a community-owned theatre dedicated to serving the Centre County region. The theatre is a hub of local culture, featuring artists both homegrown and nationally renowned. There is something for everyone at The State Theatre--rock `n' roll, country, indie, and blues; drama, musical theatre, comedy, and opera; movies, dance, stand-up, and children's programming. There is rarely a day at the theatre without a show to be seen, a concert to be heard, or a laugh to be had.

Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the incredible career of three-time Sprint Cup Series champion Tony Stewart on his retirement. Tony Stewart, known to his many fans as ``Smoke,'' started his career as a kid go-kart racing. He climbed the ladder one step at a time throughout his 20-year driving career to become the legend he is today. Every time Tony faced an obstacle, he overcame it with unmatched tenacity. He is a reminder to all of us that champions aren't born winners; they are built through hard work, grit, and determination. Tony is driven by that same doggedness off the track, leading Stewart-Haas Racing in my congressional district in Kannapolis, North Carolina, and helping folks in need through the Tony Stewart Foundation. His role might be changing, but I know Smoke's presence at the racetrack and his impact on the sport we love will continue. Renee and I applaud Tony for his outstanding career, and we wish him all the best as he begins this next chapter. Madam Speaker, on behalf of North Carolina's Eighth District and racing fans everywhere, I am proud to say congratulations to Tony-- always a racer, forever a champion. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [House] [Page H7179] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO THREE-TIME SPRINT CUP SERIES CHAMPION TONY STEWART (Mr. HUDSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

Mr. President, last week the House overwhelmingly passed the bipartisan 21st Century Cures Act, the medical innovation bill. Now it is the Senate's turn to move this bill forward and send it to the President's desk for signature. This legislation has earned wide support from both sides of the aisle, and it is one of the most important bills that will pass this year. It is not hard to see why. It will encourage investment in biomedical research to help deliver treatment and cures to patients. It will cut through redtape and burdensome regulations while also protecting safety, and it will build upon progress to support regenerative medicine and other innovative therapies. Cures also includes provisions to strengthen mental health programs and to provide much needed resources to help combat the opioid epidemic. It is legislation that could have an impact on each of our States and on each of our constituents. Later today, Senators will take the next step in advancing 21st Century Cures. With continued cooperation, we can pass this bipartisan bill very soon. The Cures legislation is just one key area where the Senate has been working to complete its work before the holidays. Negotiations are ongoing on a continuing resolution, which we will consider this week. This week we will also pass the Defense authorization conference report, and work continues to finalize other outstanding conference reports, including the Water Resources Development Act--the so-called WRDA bill--and the energy policy modernization bill. As these efforts continue, I thank all of those who have been working around the clock to reach a conclusion on these important issues. We will have a busy week ahead. Let's keep working together to get it done. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S6683] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] WORK BEFORE THE SENATE Mr. McCONNELL.

CREC-2016-12-05-pt1-PgS6685-2,CREC-2016-12-05,114,COMMENDING THE SENIOR SENATOR FROM TENNESSEE,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S6685] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMMENDING THE SENIOR SENATOR FROM TENNESSEE Mr. REID. Mr. President, before I give my remarks, as I planned, I wish to say a brief word about Senator Alexander, the senior Senator from Tennessee. During my time in Congress, he has always been one of the most pleasant people I have dealt with. He is always very thorough in whatever he wants to talk to you about, and I have found him to be a remarkably good Senator. He has a background that is stunningly important--a longtime Governor of the State of Tennessee and someone who has served in one of the Republican administrations as Secretary of Education. This Cures bill is not everything I would wish it to be. I think it is too weak in some parts. I think we could have done better. But I have been around for a long time, and I understand what legislation is all about. We have gotten money. We have been trying for a couple years to get money for opioids. There should be far more, and it should be given in a different way than we have it here, but it is money. We have people-- as we are sitting here for a few minutes today--dying as a result of this scourge that is sweeping America. It is in Oklahoma, it is in Tennessee, and it is in places such as New Hampshire. It is all over. So that part of it is excellent. As to the resources we give the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, there is not enough we can do. I would hope there would be much more. I am pleased to report that this is the beginning of the Moonshot that Senator Biden will lead in research to defeat cancer. It can be done. We have made tremendous progress, and we are making it on a monthly basis now. There are a lot of good things in this legislation. One of the things that the senior Senator from Tennessee and I have spoken about is clinical trials. Sometimes you don't understand the importance of those until they could personally affect you. With the injury that I suffered almost 2 years ago, I am hopeful that in my lifetime there will be something done to be able to take care of retinas that are damaged. We have a lot of those that are damaged--a lot of retinas that are damaged as a result of diabetes and other maladies--but not a lot has been done on injuries to retinas. But there is work being done on that now. I had a very good meeting on Saturday with one of the foremost people in the world dealing with retinas, Dr. Bressler of Johns Hopkins, and they are doing some stuff. They are doing stem cell work. They are doing some transplants. They are doing some good things. On a very personal basis, Senator Alexander came and talked to me one evening. He asked if I had time. Of course, I always have time for any Senator who wants to see me. He came with tears in his eyes to talk to me about some things he had learned about people who had damaged their eyes and how some work is being done with these people who once could not see and, as in the Biblical passages, can now see. It was a very wonderful meeting, and I had the opportunity to meet one individual he introduced me to--a man named Doug Oliver, who was basically blind. Because of work done with stem cells, he can now see. He is off disability, he can drive a car, and he can read. He could not do that before. I appreciate it. It perhaps could have passed without him, but I doubt it, and I admire his legislative skills. I hope, with the new Congress coming, he will pull even those skills he doesn't have now out of his back pocket so perhaps we can do even more. There is going to be a lot more that needs to be done in the new Republican Congress. So I express my public admiration to the senior Senator from Tennessee for the good work he has done for his State and for the country for many decades. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S6685] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMMENDING THE SENIOR SENATOR FROM TENNESSEE Mr. REID.

CREC-2016-12-05-pt1-PgS6685-3,CREC-2016-12-05,114,CELEBRATION AT STANDING ROCK,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6685-S6686] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CELEBRATION AT STANDING ROCK Mr. REID. Mr. President, in the bitter cold of a North Dakota December yesterday--and it can be cold up there--there was a celebration at Standing Rock. Why? Along the banks of the Missouri River, in this heavy snow, there were hugs and tears of joy and drumming and dancing as the people of the Standing Rock Tribe and others heard the good news. The Army Corps of Engineers did not--did not--approve the easement for the Dakota Access oil pipeline. Instead, the Corps of Engineers determined that the pipeline must be rerouted. I am so glad. It is so important. This is a victory for the Standing Rock Sioux. We know the long history Native Americans have in the State of the Presiding Officer. We know that around the country--I have 26 Indian entities in Nevada--they have been treated so poorly. Nevada is no different from any other State. They were pushed off of the lands they dwelt on before we showed up, we White folks here in America. They have been pushed around. So when the Standing Rock people heard the good news that the Corps of Engineers had finally given them at least some small victory, it was very exciting for them. It is a victory for them. They have been objecting to this construction for more than 2 years. The tribe was concerned about a number of issues, not the least of which were their ancestral grounds, some of which land has their ancestors buried there. They were afraid of water contamination and other problems. In a statement to the press, the chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe said: We wholeheartedly support the decision of the administration and commend with the utmost gratitude the courage it took on the part of President Obama, the Army Corps, the Department of Justice and the Department of Interior to take steps to correct the course of history and do the right thing. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and all of Indian country will be forever grateful to the Obama administration for this historic decision. Indians have taken one loss after another. Rare are there any victories for the Indians. I agree with the chairman of the tribe. This is a historic decision, and it was a momentous step toward correcting the course of a disgraceful history. As I said last week here on the floor, the treatment of the Standing Rock Sioux by our government has been shameful--not only recently but for more than a century. The Sioux were pushed to reservations first. I say ``reservations''--plural. But even that land was taken--most of it--and then massive dams were built that put the tribe's best farmland underwater. The result of these actions was a crippling poverty that plagued the tribe for generations--even this generation. This mistreatment was not unique, as I have indicated, to Standing Rock. Indeed, there are tribes all across the Nation with very similar histories. We have them in Nevada. Yesterday's decision will not make up for the past, but the President's action was a huge step toward correcting a terrible wrong. Money, profits, and not human dignity, was the direction of the pipeline. The Obama administration changed that. For far too long, the pleas for justice for Native Americans have gone unanswered. At least now, on this occasion, the Standing Rock Sioux and Native Americans throughout this country know that someone is listening and their concerns are being addressed by the U.S. Government. I admire the support of those who locked arms with the Standing Rock [[Page S6686]] Sioux. Appropriately enough, these people call themselves water protectors. Native Americans from all over America, politicians from all over America, entertainers from all over America, and other celebrities were some of the water protectors, and we must recognize the more than 2,000 veterans who traveled to Standing Rock from across America to protect the protestors from violence. It is also important to note that speech after speech and demonstration after demonstration were peaceful. All the leaders of this demonstration said time after time after time that it would be peaceful, and it has been. The only aggression has not been from the Indians but from those people who are pushing the pipeline. It is no surprise that many of these veterans are Native Americans because American Indians serve in our Nation's Armed Forces in greater numbers per capita than any other ethnic group. Going back to World War II, of course, the great Ira Hayes, who was made famous by Johnny Cash--they have a long history of serving in all of our wars and stepping forward. I am gratified at the strength of the Standing Rock Sioux. Their ancestral burial grounds will remain protected and their water clean. I thank President Obama and his administration and the Army Corps of Engineers for their action. This victory was the culmination of months and months of analysis and deliberation. I appreciate the conclusion reached. But everyone should know that this fight isn't over. We know from long experience that our decisionmakers keel over for fossil fuel interests. We must remain vigilant. My only hope is that the Trump administration will not undo the justice the Native Americans have finally received. All of us must support the Standing Rock Sioux and help them protect their history and their land and their water. As one aside, many decades ago I was the Lieutenant Governor of the State of Nevada, and we had our Lieutenant Governors' conference in Oklahoma. It was a wonderful week that we spent in Oklahoma. One of the highlights of that trip was an education that I received one night of a--I assume it is still going on; I don't know--a wonderful pageant that took place in a place that I believe is called Tahlequah--I believe that was the name of the place--where in such detail and in such magnificence was described how Oklahoma has so many Native Americans who came from Florida. It was a wonderful story. I was very impressed with the Native Americans whom I met and have met since that time in Oklahoma. And a memento I was given there in Oklahoma--frankly, someone stole it from me, but each one of us, each Lieutenant Governor, was given a little painting by a famous Oklahoman--at the time, at least--whose time was Tiger. I don't know what his real name was, but he was a famous artist. It was a beautiful Indian scene he had painted. We all got one. It was an original. I am sorry someone took it out of my office. But I have fond memories of that convention in Oklahoma where I learned so much about the people of Oklahoma. Some of us in the West have had over the years kind of a negative impression of Oklahoma--the Okies coming into California, all of these uneducated people causing trouble--but that was a wonderful trip to Oklahoma. I was terribly impressed at the time and have always been impressed with the people of Oklahoma. Just a little aside here: I have had some good fortune at being able to legislate things here in Washington. One of the things that can be looked at as good or bad--and maybe I won't get a lot of pats on the back for this with the new administration--but a Senator from Oklahoma and I did some very good work. The Congressional Review Act was Reid- Nichols legislation. That was hard to do, but what it basically said is if there is a regulation promulgated by an administration, we as a Congress have an opportunity to look it over again to determine if, in fact, we have the ability, with enough folks, to overturn that regulation. So, again, as the Presiding Officer is from Oklahoma, I want him to understand my affection for the State of Oklahoma and the people of Oklahoma. I have had some difficult tussles with people from Oklahoma over the years. There is no better example of that than Dr. Coburn. But having said that, I have never found more of a gentleman than Dr. Coburn. Even though we disagreed on some policy issues, he was always a gentleman and I have appreciated the things I learned from him. I yield the floor. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6685-S6686] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CELEBRATION AT STANDING ROCK Mr. REID. Mr. President, in the bitter cold of a North Dakota December yesterday--and it can be cold up there--there was a celebration at Standing Rock. Why? Along the banks of the Missouri River, in this heavy snow, there were hugs and tears of joy and drumming and dancing as the people of the Standing Rock Tribe and others heard the good news. The Army Corps of Engineers did not--did not--approve the easement for the Dakota Access oil pipeline. Instead, the Corps of Engineers determined that the pipeline must be rerouted. I am so glad. It is so important. This is a victory for the Standing Rock Sioux. We know the long history Native Americans have in the State of the Presiding Officer. We know that around the country--I have 26 Indian entities in Nevada--they have been treated so poorly. Nevada is no different from any other State. They were pushed off of the lands they dwelt on before we showed up, we White folks here in America. They have been pushed around. So when the Standing Rock people heard the good news that the Corps of Engineers had finally given them at least some small victory, it was very exciting for them. It is a victory for them. They have been objecting to this construction for more than 2 years. The tribe was concerned about a number of issues, not the least of which were their ancestral grounds, some of which land has their ancestors buried there. They were afraid of water contamination and other problems. In a statement to the press, the chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe said: We wholeheartedly support the decision of the administration and commend with the utmost gratitude the courage it took on the part of President Obama, the Army Corps, the Department of Justice and the Department of Interior to take steps to correct the course of history and do the right thing.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah. Remembering James Tancill Lyons Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Jim Lyons, a longtime staffer on Capitol Hill--my staffer--and a fixture in tax policy here in DC, who passed away on September 29 of this year. James Tancill Lyons was born on March 7, 1973, to Stephen and Ann Lyons, both natives of the DC-Virginia area with longstanding ties to the local community. Growing up in Springfield, VA, Jim was an accomplished athlete, excelling in both baseball and basketball. Oddly, for a sports fan in the DC area, his favorite football team was the Dallas Cowboys--a decision he made consciously because his older brother, Stephen, was a big Redskins fan. Jim was also a great student, eventually graduating summa cum laude from James Madison University. He went to law school at the University of Texas, where he made the Editing Committee of the Texas Journal of Business Law and won a scholarship for being the best tax law student in his class after pulling the top grade in his business associations, income tax, international tax, corporate tax, and estate and gift tax classes. After law school, he earned a clerkship at the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and then got a job working for Cleary Gottlieb, one of the finest law firms in the country. Of course, you would never guess any of this if you knew Jim. While he was always an incredibly valuable and often brilliant attorney and congressional staffer, he talked about his college and law school days as though he spent most of his time having fun and just barely skating by. That, of course, was vintage Jim Lyons--incredibly outgoing but unbelievably humble. Jim could have a long conversation with anyone about pretty much anything, but he was never one to spend all that much time touting his own accomplishments. Make no mistake, Jim Lyons was very accomplished. After his time at the law firm in New York, Jim made his way to the House Ways and Means Committee, and, following a brief subsequent and successful stint at the Department of Justice, he was hired by Chairman Chuck Grassley to serve as tax counsel on the Senate Finance Committee. In his 8 years on the Finance Committee, he made a mark on every major tax bill, not to mention a number of debt and budget deals that went through the Senate, including many tax-extenders bills, some of which he seemed to be able to cobble together singlehandedly. [[Page S6687]] Jim was smart as a whip. He was a tremendously valuable congressional staffer because he had both a remarkable understanding of tax policy and an uncanny ability to see all the traps and pitfalls that stood ahead for any particular proposal or piece of legislation. He had an encyclopedic knowledge of the technical aspects of the Tax Code, as well as a clear understanding of the real-world implications, immediately seeing where a particular tax policy or bill would fit in the larger policy and, when necessary, the political landscape. Jim was one of those people who could go into the weeds to discuss, debate, and negotiate tax policy literally with anyone on the planet but also break that same policy down to its essential elements and explain it to lesser mortals, including, I have to say, more than a few of us U.S. Senators. Of course, like all of us, Jim had his own ideological views and opinions, and he made no secret about the way he saw the world and his beliefs about the best path forward for our country. When necessary, he was a fierce advocate for his own views, but more importantly, for someone in his position, he was able, when necessary, to dispassionately apply his accrued knowledge and expertise to any tax proposal, whether it came from a conservative or liberal or a Republican or Democrat, and then break it down to its essence and give a clear and concise assessment of the policy and its chances for being enacted. All of this made him an essential and indispensable part of our efforts on the Senate Finance Committee for close to a decade. As I think all of my colleagues will attest, staffers with that kind of knowledge and ability to evaluate policy and lay out its chances for success really can be hard to come by. However, in the weeks since Jim's passing, it hasn't been his accomplishments or his knowledge of the Tax Code that people have most remembered; instead, most of the focus has been on his friendly demeanor, his mischievous sense of humor, and most of all, his kind heart. Dozens of Jimmy's friends and colleagues visited Jim and his family in the hospital during his final days, and during the October recess, hundreds attended a memorial service held here in the Capitol. Each one of these people had at least one personal story to share about Jim. Sure, some of the stories did touch on his successes as a staffer and his professional disposition, but far more often the stories were about Jim's kindness, even to strangers, or his ability to make people feel at ease--and sometimes laugh uncontrollably--even in tense situations. Jim was always quick to offer assistance and comfort to those in need and to provide a much needed laugh when things got really tough. He is one of very few people I have come across on Capitol Hill--and keep in mind I have been here a while--who will be remembered more or less equally for the bills he successfully drafted and negotiated and for the way he cracked everyone up at the negotiating table. I think my favorite story I have heard about Jim came from his mother Ann. In 2003, Jim was living in New York City when much of that part of the country suffered a massive blackout. It is difficult to be in a place like New York without power, and Jim noticed many people on his way home who were stranded and in need of assistance. Rather than look down at the ground and head quickly for home, as many would probably want to do in that situation, Jim offered help to a dozen or so people, bringing them all home to his apartment, giving them both food and a comfortable space to ride out the power outage. Most of these people were strangers. Yet Jim, ever the kind soul, offered his time and his home to help them through a difficult evening. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of pages 14 and 15 from the August 2003 edition of Cleargolaw News, a newsletter for the law firm where Jim worked at that time, be printed in the Record following my remarks. The article tells the story of Jim's efforts during the power blackout. These are the types of stories that have constantly been shared since Jim's passing, and I know these memories and stories from people who knew and worked with Jim have been helpful to his family during this difficult time. When I hear these accounts of people's interactions with Jim, I am reminded of a popular hymn in my church, which reads: Each life that touches ours for good Reflects thine own great mercy, Lord; Thou sendest blessings from above Thru words and deeds of those who love. What greater gift dost thou bestow, What greater goodness can we know Than Christ-like friends, whose gentle ways Strengthen our faith, enrich our days. When such a friend from us departs, We hold forever in our hearts A sweet and hallowed memory, Bringing us nearer, Lord, to thee. Jim Lyons led a life which touched many others for the better. His positive influence has been felt by countless people, pretty much anyone who had the opportunity to interact with him. I personally already miss Jim's stalwart presence on the Finance Committee. I miss his wise and plain-spoken advice and unequalled knowledge of tax policy. More than that, I miss the kind and humorous manner that endeared Jim to so many of us working in and around the Senate. There is a simple quote--an anonymous proverb of sorts--that has often been attributed to Dr. Seuss, though its origin is ultimately in dispute: ``Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened.'' Over the past couple of months, I think that has been the prevailing sentiment among those of us who were lucky enough to know Jim Lyons. While tears have been shed and great sadness has been felt, the remembrances we have had of Jim's life and our interactions with him have given all of us reason to smile and even laugh. I want to once again express my condolences to Jim's family, his parents Stephen and Ann, his brother Steve, his two nephews, Tyler and Blake, and of course his beloved dog Buddy. Recently, I have had the opportunity to spend time with and get to know Jim's wonderful family. They are truly extraordinary people, and my prayers continue to go out to them. I know I am not alone in that regard. I care for them. Everybody who knew Jim and has now known them cares for them. Our sympathy and our heartfelt thanks go out to them for allowing their son to become the great person he became, and, of course, allowing him to come and work with us on Capitol Hill. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Thank You for Taking Care of Us (By Alice Steinert) Here is a wonderfully refreshing story about a truly good, kind person. The day of the blackout was scary for some, devastating for others, and just plain inconvenient for many. There are those of us who still have thighs and calves that ache from all those flights of stairs! Many people could not get home that night for a number of reasons--1) after walking down that many flights of stairs, some people were a bit lame and therefore could not walk the distance to their homes, or their homes were too far to walk to; 2) there were few, if any, buses, taxi cabs, cars, trains, ferries, no subways, and no hotel vacancies; 3) etc., etc., etc. But, for those of us fortunate enough to know Jim Lyons, CGSH Associate extraordinaire, we certainly know the meaning of the true human spirit. Jim invited many people to his home that day when we had to evacuate OLP. He provided an immediate ``base'' for people to relax, calm down, regroup, make contact with family/friends, eat, drink, whatever they needed. But, for nine of us (Ron Becton, Robert Franklin, Monica Gagnon, Glenville Hunter, Amy Menendez, Alice Steinert, Jason Steinert, Naj-Lah Toussaint and Carol Whatley), he provided much, much more. He provided a safe haven for the night. At about 7:45 P.M. Jim walked from his home to OLP to see if there was anyone else in need of assistance. Well, he found nine of us who were seriously thinking about bunking down for the night in front of the lobby doors. Without hesitation Jim invited all of us to his home (he had never even met some of us before). Not only did he provide us with a roof over our heads, he also offered food and beverage, the use of his cell phone, pillows and blankets, and even gave up his bed to two of us ladies. Not only that, he bought toothbrushes for us; What ensued was a night we will all remember--good people, stimulating conversation, a lot of fun, and a great deal of bonding and comeraderie. While we will individually, and as a group, thank Jim, I think everyone in the firm should recognize what an exceptional person Jim is. If there were more ``Jim's'' in the world, what a different place it would be. God Bless You Jim. Remembering King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today, December 5, 2016, in commemoration of the 89th birthday of the late [[Page S6688]] King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand and in recognition of the National Day of Thailand. In remembrance of the extraordinary life, steady leadership, and remarkable 70-year reign of the beloved King Bhumibol, I have introduced S. Con. Res. 57, along with Representative Matt Salmon in the House. This resolution honors the late King's lasting legacy, extends our collective condolences to the royal family and the people of Thailand, and celebrates the alliance and friendship between our two nations. I would like to thank the cosponsors of this resolution, Senators Whitehouse, Roberts, Markey, Flake, Cotton, and Gardner. Additionally, I express my appreciation to Chairman Bob Corker for his assistance in receiving timely consideration of this bipartisan effort in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. His Majesty, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, enjoyed a special relationship with the United States, having been born in Cambridge, MA, in 1927, while his father was completing his medical studies at Harvard University. He was always a trusted friend of the United States in advancing a strong and enduring alliance and partnership between our two countries. At the time of his death on October 13, 2016, King Bhumibol Adulyadej was the longest serving head of state in the world and the longest serving in the history of Thailand. He dedicated his life to the well- being of the Thai people and the sustainable development of his country. His Majesty was an anchor of peace and stability for Thailand and for the region, earning him the deep reverence of the Thai people and the respect of leaders around the world. I hope my colleagues will join me tomorrow in passing S. Con. Res. 57 as a gesture of respect and appreciation for the life of this great leader and as a symbol of our continued commitment to and friendship with Thailand. Additionally, I am sure my colleagues in the Senate will join me in offering our warmest congratulations and best wishes to the new King of Thailand, His Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Passage Vitiated--H.R. 5602, S. 3336, and Calendar Nos. 675 through 683 Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to vitiate passage of H.R. 5602, S. 3336, and Calendar Nos. 675 through 683. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Farewell to the Senate Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the Senate floor for the last time. I am not generally big on nostalgic reminiscences, but I would like to briefly reflect on what is clearly the greatest honor of my professional life--my 12 years in the U.S. Senate and 5\1/ 2\ years in the U.S. House of Representatives and the enormous honor of serving the people of Louisiana to whom I will always be so deeply indebted. In some ways it seems like just yesterday that I was on the floor of the U.S. House being sworn in, surrounded by our very young children, except for Jack, who wasn't born yet. I said then: ``I am honored, humbled, awestruck to stand before you today.'' I stated my simple goal: to become at ease and comfortable as I learn the ways of Congress, as I hopefully become an effective representative and respected colleague and friend, but never to become so at ease and comfortable that I lose these feelings of honor, of humility, of awe, and, believe me, I haven't. My very first year in the Senate was a very memorable one. That year Louisiana was struck by Hurricanes Rita and Katrina. After the initial shock of those cataclysmic events, I realized that for quite some time, my priorities as Louisiana Senator would be dominated by the desperate need to rebuild our State, including dramatically improving our hurricane and flood protection and restoring our coastline. Katrina's devastation was hard to imagine, destroying much of Southeast Louisiana and Coastal Mississippi. Less than 1 month later, Hurricane Rita slammed into Southwest Louisiana as another one of the most intense hurricanes in history. I immediately went to work with Senator Landrieu and the rest of our Louisiana delegation as well as my good friends Thad Cochran, Trent Lott, and others to secure the necessary disaster recovery assistance and also to make reforms to the Army Corps of Engineers to better protect our families and communities from future natural disasters. Louisiana has continued to face and survive other major disasters, including Hurricane Gustav in August and September 2008, Hurricane Ike in September of that same year, Hurricane Isaac in 2012, the Red River flooding in Northern and Central Louisiana, and the 1,000-year-flood event in greater Baton Rouge and Acadiana this past August. As if all of that weren't enough, in April of 2010, the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded off the coast of Louisiana, killing 11 men and devastating our coastline. The disaster, followed by the horribly misguided offshore drilling moratorium President Obama put in place, caused economic and environmental chaos in Louisiana. Once again, I immediately went to work with so many others to increase and improve safety measures and reopen the Gulf of Mexico to energy exploration and put people back to work. We introduced legislation to dedicate a majority of the BP penalties toward restoring coastal ecosystems and economies damaged by the spill. It was an uphill battle to ensure Louisiana was fairly compensated, but we did, and we achieved substantial wins, including passage of that critical RESTORE Act that I described. During the recovery fight following each of these disasters, I found that the most effective leadership involved communicating clearly and employing solutions based on Louisiana common sense, and what always inspired me and kept me going was the unbelievable resilience, faith, and determination of my fellow Louisianans. Their strength and optimism have been oh so powerful reminders of how blessed I have been to serve them. On a host of other important issues, I always sought to further two sets of political values, really modeled after my two favorite Presidents, Ronald Reagan and Teddy Roosevelt. I always strove to further the central American tradition of limited government and individual freedom, and I was never afraid to shake things up, to demand needed reforms to ensure that leaders in Washington served the American people and not the other way around. I have had the honor of protecting Louisiana's traditions and proud heritage while here in the Senate. Louisianans love the outdoors and want strong environmental conservation and sportsmen's policies to maintain that culture, and that certainly includes securing the rights afforded to each American by the Second Amendment, which I have fought to do. Louisianans respect the sanctity of life, which has been one of my top priorities while serving in Congress. I have introduced many bills that end taxpayer funding of abortion and abortion mills and have proudly stood in the defense of life. When it comes to our Nation's immigration policies, I have been an advocate for targeted reforms that fix the immigration crisis, starting with border security and enforcing the immigration laws already on the books. I fought President Obama's unconstitutional attempts to implement Executive amnesty, which only encourages more immigrants to come here illegally and insults the millions of fine immigrants who do follow U.S. law. I was also the first to introduce legislation in 2007 to end dangerous sanctuary city policies and have continued to do so each Congress since. I have also been critical of too big to fail in the banking sector and have found [[Page S6689]] banking reform to be an area in which Republicans can absolutely find common ground with Democrats. That is where I found success in passing into law specific measures that restrict too-big-to-fail and tax-funded bailouts. Also during my time in Congress, I have introduced several important government reform bills so we can get back to the best traditions of our democracy, which includes electing citizen legislators, making sure they don't make themselves into a separate ruling class, and advocating for term limits so individuals don't remain in office for an eternity. Americans of all backgrounds think Washington is on a different planet and Members of Congress just don't get it. That is why I fought to end Congress's automatic pay raises each year. I first introduced that language in 2009, and the raises have been successfully blocked each year since. Congress can be an effective representative body only when it lives under the same laws it imposes on the rest of the country, and one major way to support that is through term limits. When I was a member of the Louisiana State legislature, I was successful in establishing legislative term limits there, and I have offered the leading term limits measure for Congress here, as well as imposing it on myself. I fought for commonsense legislation that helps all Americans have access to high-quality and affordable health care. That includes the work to dismantle ObamaCare and replace it with patient-centered health care reform, which I am very hopeful the incoming Trump administration will achieve. In the meantime, I have been fighting to end Washington's exemption from ObamaCare, an illegal Obama administration Executive order that allows Washington elites to avoid the most inconvenient, expensive aspects of the Affordable Care Act by giving themselves taxpayer subsidized health care through an exchange meant solely for small businesses. Also in the health care arena, I was able to pass into law the bipartisan Steve Gleason Act of 2015. It provided immediate relief for patients who have been denied access to lifesaving and life-altering medical equipment. It was about a 2014 Medicare policy change that we had to reverse. Our bill allowed these patients to have access to medical equipment that truly empowers them, that is a true lifeline, and it changes their lives absolutely for the better. I have also fought against large drug manufacturing lobbies to allow for reimportation of safe and approved prescription medicine from other countries, which gives patients, especially our seniors, relief from rising health care costs. I have been honored to serve in the Senate in additional ways as well, including as a top Republican on the Environment and Public Works Committee and most recently as chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. I am very proud to say that we have accomplished so many of our goals in those two roles. We worked in a bipartisan fashion on EPW to pass several major pieces of legislation, including the Water Resources and Development Act of 2007 and the even more significant WRDA of 2014, several reauthorizations of the highway bill, the bipartisan and historic rewrite of the 40-year-old Toxic Substances Control Act, which began as conversations between Senator Frank Lautenberg and myself, a partnership which Senator Tom Udall continued after Frank's unfortunate passing. We were also able to hold the administration accountable by conducting investigations into some outright corruption within the Obama EPA, and we advanced key transparency initiatives that shed light on government's attempts to implement policies that were not based on sound science or strategic needs. As chair of the Small Business Committee, I have been advocating to make sure the voices and concerns of small business owners across the country are heard in Washington. We have held 23 hearings here, 18 field hearings, numerous roundtable discussions. We have heard testimony from over 175 witnesses, usually about the disastrous negative effects of Obama policies like the new waters of the United States rule, key and disastrous effects on small businesses and job creators and their employees. At the very same time, we found common ground with Ranking Member Shaheen and other Democrats on the committee. During my tenure as chair, we passed 32 bipartisan bills out of the committee, which is 22 more than my predecessors did over a much longer period, and 8 of our bills have passed through the entire legislative process and have been signed into law. These accomplishments are but a fraction of the years of hard work my staff and I have dedicated to the people of Louisiana and, indeed, the American people. I have worked hard to be a champion for them because the government should serve the taxpayer and not the other way around, and that includes by working hard to stay in touch through 398 townhall meetings, at least 5 in each parish of Louisiana, through 231 telephone townhalls, and through active, energetic casework and constituent service. Clearly what I will treasure most about my service here is the people with whom I have been honored to serve; my colleagues, including my fellow Louisianian Senator Bill Cassidy, mentors like former Senator Rick Santorum and Senator Jeff Sessions, and most especially each of the dedicated people who have been part of Team Vitter. I have come to the Senate floor several times this year to thank key departing staff members. That is for a very simple reason. My staff has been the key ingredient--the key--to every success we have enjoyed together in public service. Wendy and I consider them a part of the family. I truly thank my staff again for their tireless, dedicated service to Louisiana. I am so very grateful. Wendy joins me in that. I want to specifically recognize some of our leaders: my chief of staff, Luke Bolar; my legislative director, Chris Stanley; my wonderful finance director, Courtney Guastela; our state director, Chip Layton; and committee staff director, Meredith West; our grants coordinator, Brenda Moore; my media head, John Brabender; and senior infrastructure policy advisor, Charles Brittingham; my senior economic adviser, David Stokes; campaign treasurer Bill Vanderbrook; and communications director, Cheyenne Klotz. I know a few of our other former senior staff members are here or are watching, like Mac Abrams, Joel DiGrado, Bryan Zumwalt, Travis Johnson, and Michael Long. Last, and obviously not least, is my beloved family. My five wonderful brothers and sisters, our children, their children, the extended family, led by the ultimate leader of Team Vitter, my wife Wendy. I can never thank them enough, and certainly I can never ever thank Wendy enough. Through it all, Wendy has been so enormously patient and supportive and understanding, not to mention being the life of every Team Vitter party, leading the rounds--rounds plural--of Fireball shots. She and our daughter Lise are in the Gallery today. I thank them and Sophie, Airey, and Jack for decades of love and support. Lise, up there, was in my arms as a 2-year-old when I was first sworn into the House of Representatives and made those previously quoted remarks: ``I am honored, humbled, awestruck to stand before you.'' She has changed some, but as I said at the beginning of my reflections, those feelings certainly have not. I would like to close as I did that day in the House over 17 years ago; that is, simply by recognizing the wonderful, loving forces that have brought me here today: God, family, led by my parents up above, and my wife Wendy, staff and friends, and of course the wonderful, wonderful people of Louisiana. They are here with me today. They are here with me always. I thank them from the depths of my heart. For the last time, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana. Tribute to David Vitter Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I have the honor to recognize and thank my colleague and friend, the Honorable Senator David Vitter, for his 25 years of service to Louisiana. Our State has been fortunate to have him as its voice and advocate in this Chamber for the past 12 years. On a personal note, when I arrived at the Senate, David worked with me, sharing with me some of the privileges that normally he, as a senior Senator, [[Page S6690]] could have kept all to himself. With great graciousness, he worked with me and said: Listen, this is how I think the process should be set up. I would like you to have some of this privilege as well. I will do the same with whoever replaces David. He has set a pattern that, again, by his graciousness and magnanimity, deserves repetition. As a new Senator, I was fortunate to have him as a resource for advice and knowledge that comes from time and experience in this body. There are some things that happen here that you have to kind of have experience to follow. David had both the experience, the sharpness, and the insight to recognize. I again look forward to sharing what he has taught me with whoever takes his place. I will note, as David did, he helped lead our State through some of our worst times. From Hurricane Katrina in 2005 to the great flood of 2016, all of the way in between, David has worked hard to make sure Louisiana and the people of Louisiana have what they need to recover. The hallmark of Senator Vitter's tenure is that he has always cared deeply about our State, constantly looking for what he could do that would benefit our State, not just in the short term but doing that which is consistent with his principles to help Louisiana and the United States thrive in the long term. He has been on the side of that family whose father goes for 2 weeks, works on an oil rig in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico, working hard so his family has a better future. David has been on the side of that mom juggling two jobs to earn enough to make sure her children's needs are met. A recent example--again for the short-term and long-term perspective David handled so well--he stayed persistent for years working across the aisle, first with Senator Frank Lautenberg, then Senator Udall, to pass the much needed reform of the Toxic Substances Control Act, the first reform of its kind in 40 years. This reform protects both the workers--those people on that rig, perhaps, at least the people who would be processing the products of that rig--but also gives the manufacturers of Louisiana and across the country the certainty they need to expand their businesses and create more jobs. On a lighter note, David is a great Saints fan. We in Louisiana kind of liked the fact that when the slogan ``Who Dat'' came up spontaneously, and people started to put it on their shirts and the NFL was going to go court to stop this from happening, David wrote a letter to Roger Goddell. The letter started off by saying: ``Who Dat.'' So speaking truth to power on behalf of the ``Who Dat Nation'' is one credit of his. Similarly, David was tweeting before our President-elect made it perhaps as high profile. I remember during the 2013 Super Bowl in New Orleans--and again the context of this is, the Saints had just been punished--of course Saints fans think unfairly--by Roger Goddell. So during the 2013 Super Bowl in New Orleans, when the power went out, David's tweet, without missing a beat said: ``Like most Saints fans, I am immediately assuming Roger Goddell is the chief suspect for the power outage.'' The quick-witted quip cut to the emotion of the ``Who Dat Nation.'' As the 114th Congress comes to a close, the Senate will be losing an important Member. David brings a sound, strategic mind to this Chamber that will be missed. I wish him, Wendy, their children, Lise, Sophie, Airey, and Jack, the best of luck in their journey forward. On behalf of all Louisiana, I say thank you. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana. Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana for his very kind remarks. More importantly, I want to thank him for years of great partnership, great work on behalf of Louisiana. I know he will make an outstanding senior Senator. Thank you. I yield the floor. Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the 21st Century Cures Act, and I commend the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, Senator Lamar Alexander and Senator Patty Murray, for their unwavering commitment to this very significant bipartisan legislation. The Senate HELP Committee, on which I am privileged to serve, has devoted considerable time and effort to this comprehensive legislation. It includes many reforms and priorities that will benefit so many families across our great country. The 21st Century Cures Act will support the research and development of safe treatments and cures for millions of Americans and their families who are coping with devastating diseases. It will improve the process of moving new discoveries from laboratory benches to patient bedsides. I doubt that there is a family in America who will not be touched by this important legislation in some way. All of us have a family member, a coworker, or a friend who has courageously faced the struggles of living with a debilitating chronic illness or a rare disease or who has received a devastating diagnosis and has passed away far too soon, leaving a hole in our hearts. Imagine how this could change with the passage of the 21st Century Cures Act and strong support of the research and development that will lead to new treatments and therapies that can help us achieve our dream of conquering so many devastating diseases. Simply put, this legislation matters. It matters to the children who know firsthand the burden of living with type 1 diabetes and who beg their parents for just one day off--their birthday or Christmas--from having to deal with the consequences of their juvenile diabetes. It matters to the family members who know the agonizing experience of looking into the eyes of a loved one suffering from Alzheimer's disease, only to receive a confused look in return. It matters to the parents of young boys who have Duchenne muscular dystrophy, who know what it is like to give their all in an effort to help their sons achieve their dreams, whether it is finishing college or driving a car, even as every day their children battle the progression of this debilitating and ultimately terminal illness. The 21st Century Cures Act will drive progress in medical innovation so that we can prevail against these diseases and many more that cause so much pain and suffering, so much fear and uncertainty, and so much heartbreak. There simply is no investment that we can make that provides greater return for Americans than our investment in biomedical research. It not only leads to new discoveries and the development of better treatments and even cures but also can have a dramatic effect on the budgets of families, States, and the Federal Government. The bill before us will help direct $4.8 billion to the National Institutes of Health, including $1.6 billion for the BRAIN Initiative to improve our understanding of diseases such as ALS, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's, our Nation's most costly disease. We spend $263 billion a year caring for people with Alzheimer's disease. Of that amount, approximately $160 billion comes from the Medicare and Medicaid Programs. If the current trajectory continues as our population grows older, this disease will bankrupt the Medicare and Medicaid Programs. That is why I am so pleased to see the BRAIN Initiative funded in this bill and also the work we are doing in the Appropriations Committee to boost funding for Alzheimer's disease and other dementias so that we can finally find effective treatments, a means of prevention, or perhaps even a cure for this disease that brings so much heartache not only to those suffering from it but to their families as well. Our bill will also help provide $1.8 billion for the Vice President's Cancer Moonshot. We all know that Vice President Biden has taken on this cause--a very personal one for him--because he lost his beloved son Beau to cancer. Another exciting field that will be funded by this bill is $30 million for regenerative medicine, using adult stem [[Page S6691]] cells. How exciting it was to have an individual come before our policy lunch whose sight had been restored due to innovative stem cell surgery. This individual lives in Tennessee now but happens to be from Presque Isle, ME, just 13 miles from where I was born and grew up. How I wish so many older people in this country who are losing their vision to macular degeneration and glaucoma--in some cases, a combination of both--or injuries to their eyes could benefit from this exciting development with adult stem cells, which has restored the sight of someone who was legally blind. He now can drive. That is so exciting, and that is the promise of researching regenerative medicine. In addition to support for NIH, the 21st Century Cures Act will help direct $1 billion in much needed funding to address the horrendous heroin and opioid abuse problem in this country. Maine has been particularly hard hit by this epidemic. In just the first 9 months of this year, Maine experienced a record 286 overdose deaths. That is more than one a day. Tragically, that number already exceeds the 272 overdose deaths in Maine during all of 2015. I am distressed when I hear about the lack of treatment options for Mainers who are struggling with drug addiction, particularly in rural areas. As a result of the shortage of treatment alternatives, this epidemic is playing out in emergency rooms, county jails, and on the main streets of my State. I can't tell you how many sheriffs have come to me pleading for help, telling me that the intake area of their jail looks like a detox center or an emergency room of a hospital. They are overwhelmed by these cases. We can and must do more to support access to treatment and to alert people of all ages to the risks of opioid abuse and heroin use. The 21st Century Cures Act will provide a vital infusion of $1 billion over 2 years to support grants to States to supplement treatment and prevention efforts. I was talking with one of my colleagues earlier today. Both of us remember when we were in school hearing lectures from recovering heroin addicts who came into the schools, and I can state that it was highly effective. We would never have tried heroin. I can't even think of a proper analogy. We know, unfortunately, that many of the people who are using heroin started with prescription opioids, and that is why I am encouraged by movements across our country and by actions taken, at my request and the request of other Senators, by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to make sure we are not putting pressure on providers to overprescribe opioids. Surely they are appropriate in certain cases, but the number of prescriptions has soared in this country and is twice the number prescribed on a per capita basis as in our neighboring country of Canada. The 21st Century Cures Act also includes a bill that I introduced with several of my colleagues--Senators Warren, Kirk, Baldwin, Alexander, and Murray--that is called the Advancing NIH Strategic Planning and Improving Representation in Medical Research Act. Despite its extremely cumbersome name, it is an important bill that has been incorporated into this legislation. It will require the NIH to release periodically a strategic plan outlining how the agency will meet its mission statement, and it will provide us with important guidance and metrics as we continue to work together to increase this vital funding. It will also help to ensure that study populations in clinical research are more representative of the diverse population in our country. For example, women face many of the same health threats as men, such as heart disease and cancer, but they react differently to various treatments. I remember years ago an infamous study that was called MRFIT. It had only men enrolled in it. I believe, if memory serves me correctly, it was to look at heart disease. Well, women often have different symptoms of heart disease than do men, and they respond differently to different medications, therapies, and treatments. We also know that women are at higher risk for certain chronic health conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease and osteoporosis. They suffer from those diseases in far greater numbers than do men. With Alzheimer's disease, I am wondering whether it is simply a matter that the biggest risk factor is age and women live longer than men, but perhaps there are other factors at play. My point is that by helping to ensure that women, African Americans, Latinos, and other demographic groups are appropriately represented in clinical research, we can increase our scientific understanding of the causes, risk factors, prevention strategies, and effects of treatments for diseases that commonly or disproportionately affect these populations. The bill before us also includes legislation that I introduced with my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Baldwin, to help address the educational debt burden that many young researchers face. This is so important to help ensure that America's finest, up-and-coming young researchers continue to help lead the world in biomedical discovery in this country. I don't want to lose these young talented people to other countries. I want them to stay right here. If they come to work for the NIH or the CDC or other federally funded institutions and agencies and we can get them help with their medical school, college, their advanced degrees, and their debt, that is a very good agreement for us to be making. It is also of tremendous importance that we were able to add mental health legislation to the 21st Century Cures Act. The reforms in this bill will enhance coordination, address a lack of resources, and develop real solutions to improve outcomes for individuals with serious mental illness and to help their families, who are often desperate to get them the help they need. I am pleased that the bill also includes the Mental Health on Campus Improvement Act, which I offered as an amendment when we considered the mental health legislation in committee. My colleague, Senator Dick Durbin, and I introduced this legislation for the first time in 2009. I commend him for his leadership. College students in Maine and across the country must have access to critical and often lifesaving mental health services. Despite growing demand for these critical services, far too many students still lack access. Without these services, students may experience detrimental effects that range from declining academic performance to drug dependence and to being at greater risk of suicide. While millions of Americans suffer from mental illness, only a statistical few engage in unspeakable acts of violence against themselves or others. Suicide, however, is the leading cause of death among Americans between the ages of 15 and 34. In addition, recent tragedies on college campuses, such as the shooting at a community college in Roseburg, OR, or at Northern Illinois University, highlight the dire need for mental health outreach and counseling services on college campuses. Perhaps some of the tragedies that we have witnessed might have been prevented had the resources been in place to support timely diagnosis, early intervention, and effective treatment for those struggling with severe mental illness. One of the saddest meetings I have had in the last year was with a group of families from Maine who had adult children who were suffering from severe mental illness, yet these families felt powerless in getting them the help they needed. These adult children were not compliant with the medication they had been prescribed, and in many cases their families felt powerless to be able to get them the help they needed. In one terrible case, a man's son was released from a hospital in the State of Maine--from a hospital for people with mental illness--and he killed his mother, thinking she was Al Qaeda. Only then could his father get his son the institutionalized help his son so desperately needed. It was just such a painful, painful story to hear from this anguished father and husband. I believe the language in this bill will help to change that. The 21st Century Cures Act passed the House last week by an overwhelming vote of 392 to 26. Think how few bills pass with that kind of strong, bipartisan support. It is supported by President Obama, who had an op-ed in Maine newspapers this weekend endorsing the bill. It is the product of years of bipartisan work on the Senate HELP Committee, and it has earned the support of more than 300 organizations. [[Page S6692]] Frankly, I am surprised that we are having a rollcall vote--a cloture vote on this bill. I am surprised because, while this bill may not be perfect--and no bill is--there is so much that is worthwhile, good, and significant in it that will make such a difference to so many American families. I urge all of our colleagues to vote in support of this bill so that we can quickly send it to the President's desk, where he is eager to sign it into law. It may well be the most important, far-reaching legislation that we pass this year in terms of its benefits for families across this great Nation. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Supporting Our Veterans Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of nearly 100,000 veterans who live in Montana. These are folks who have earned our deep respect and gratitude. I have traveled the State many times, listened to their ideas, and I have listened to their concerns. Montana's veterans have not been shy about expressing their views. What I have heard is this. There is no doubt that we must hold the VA accountable and work to improve access to health care, jobs, education, transportation, and housing for veterans. That is why it is critically important that we are taking marching orders from veterans and the advocacy organizations that are led by veterans, because we know that their top priority is to do right by the folks who they serve. Veterans in Montana also tell me that when it comes to solving the problems facing veterans, they expect folks in Washington, DC, to check their politics at the door and go to work. Unfortunately, there are groups out there that are funded by dark money. They hide their out-of-touch political agenda behind the veil of our Nation's veterans. As the incoming ranking member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I have serious concerns about who President-Elect Trump is listening to when it comes to honoring our veterans and this Nation's commitment to those who have worn the uniform. That is why it is so troubling that recent news reports have indicated that the Trump administration is relying heavily on guidance from Concerned Veterans for America. Concerned Veterans for America is a political advocacy group funded by the Koch brothers, who want to dump unlimited amounts of dark money to push dangerous policies that would privatize the VA or to convert the Veterans Health Administration into an independent, nongovernment- chartered, for-profit corporation. CVA also wants to divert funds from the VA and cripple its ability to plan for the long term to recruit doctors and nurses and to invest in the information technology that can improve veterans' experiences at the VA. These cuts will undermine the quality of care at the VA. There is nothing wrong with helping veterans get specialty care in the community in a timely fashion when the VA cannot do it. That often happens in rural communities, but CVA's push for wholesale dismantling of the VA is not what we want, and that is not what the veterans need. We need to talk to the veterans--the veterans I have spoken to--and this is what we will see. When folks volunteer to serve in the Armed Forces, this Nation is indebted to them. We must ensure that we deliver on those promises that are made. Privatizing the VA will fail our veterans and their families. It will reduce the quality of care that our veterans receive, and it will be more expensive for taxpayers. Privatizing the VA will ultimately mean that veterans will wait longer for doctors' appointments and the cost of care will go up. All we have to do is take a look at the Veterans Choice Program, which allows veterans to access care at private facilities. It has resulted in longer wait times, and this is unacceptable. Under this program, veterans are actually waiting longer to see doctors. Hospitals are increasingly frustrated and refusing to see veterans, and costs are going through the roof. Imagine this program on steroids. That is what the CVA wants to do--all while starving the VA's existing workforce and infrastructure. In fact, what CVA is pushing for is similar to what Speaker Ryan wants to do with Medicare, and we have seen the backlash to that proposal by seniors across this Nation. The same is true with the veterans and proposals to privatize the VA. It is simply bad policy. Groups such as the VFW, the American Legion, Disabled American Veterans, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, and many others oppose privatization, and they oppose it for good reason. The American Legion national commander, Dale Barnett, said it best: The private sector didn't send our heroes to war. Uncle Sam did. Barnett is right. The Federal Government has an obligation to honor those incredible sacrifices. When we shirk that responsibility, it dishonors those brave men and women. We need to listen to the American Legion and countless other veterans groups, whose mission is to help the veterans, not unravel the VA. Veterans service organizations are very different and have a very different mission and tax structure than Concerned Veterans for America, the first being that VSOs take their cues from the veterans they represent, not from billionaire political activists who fund their operation. Groups such as the Legion, the VFW, and Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America are organized as nonprofit groups whose missions are simply to help veterans. Concerned Veterans for America is an issue advocacy group with a political mission. VSOs disclose their donors. CVA doesn't have to. Yet CVA has incredible influence and the ear of the President-elect. This is deeply concerning to me and, more importantly, it is deeply concerning to the veterans across this Nation. I talk to veterans every week when I am home in Montana. They universally tell me that they like the care they receive from the VA once they get in the door; the problem is getting in the door. They don't want to see a private doc; they want to be seen by a VA doc. They know that the VA understands their unique issues. They know that doctors and nurses at the VA are attentive to the wounds of war. My hope is that President-elect Donald Trump starts talking with the folks who want to help veterans and not to organizations with a political agenda. My hope is that he will work with Chairman Isakson and me and countless other reputable veterans groups to hold the VA accountable while increasing access to care. My hope is that he will work with Democrats, Republicans, and Independents to reform our campaign finance laws so that we can increase transparency and know who is trying to influence this government. My hope is that he will put veterans first as he chooses the next VA Secretary. I remain hopeful that we can find common ground to work together to hold the VA accountable, to improve care, and to ensure that we are all delivering for veterans. When our brothers and sisters and sons and daughters are sent to war, we make promises to them--promises we must keep. When they come home, they are changed people, and we cannot expect the private sector to address these seen and unseen wounds of war. In this upcoming Congress, there will be incredible opportunities to make progress, and I am fully committed to Montana's veterans and veterans across this country and their families, and I will push back against those who attempt to undermine the noble mission of the Veterans' Administration. Mr. President, I yield the floor. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to support the 21st Century Cures Act, which would make vital investments in research to develop new treatments for deadly diseases, including cancer. The bill would also dedicate desperately needed funding to address some of our country's most pressing public health problems--opioid addiction and mental illness. First, I would like to speak about the bill's provisions for cancer and rare diseases. Cancer touches the lives of all Americans; it doesn't discriminate. We [[Page S6693]] have all experienced the grief and pain that comes with losing a loved one, friend, or colleague to this terrible disease. Cancer is the second leading cause of death in our country. Nearly 40 percent of Americans will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lives, according to the National Cancer Institute. We have made great strides in improving detection, treatment, and survival rates for many cancers, including early-stage breast cancer, prostate cancer, and melanoma. Despite this progress, other cancers like pancreatic and certain brain cancers remain extremely deadly, with very low 5-year survival rates. These cancers are typically detected in late stages, and even the most cutting-edge treatments may result in just a few more months of life. The Cures Act designates nearly $4.8 billion in additional funds for medical research through the National Institutes of Health, $1.8 billion of which will expand and accelerate cancer research, in line with Vice President Biden's Cancer Moonshot Initiative. This research funding also supports important initiatives focused on precision medicine and neurological research. Next, I would like to talk about the bill's funding to combat opioid addiction, which is an epidemic in this country. Nearly 2 million Americans are addicted to opioids, and 19,000 Americans overdosed and died in 2014. This epidemic stems from a surge in the use of prescription drugs. It is not a coincidence that prescription overdose deaths quadrupled during the same period that opioid prescriptions quadrupled. In 2012, 259 million prescriptions for opioids were written. That means 80 percent of Americans could have a bottle of pills. Prescription drug abuse frequently leads to heroin addiction because these drugs affect the brain in the same way. This problem is exacerbated because heroin is significantly cheaper that prescription opioids like OxyContin or fentanyl. This crisis demands an immediate, comprehensive, national response. Congress took a first step earlier this year, passing the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act in May. This bill authorizes grants to expand access to substance use disorder treatment, strengthen prescription drug monitoring programs, and supply first responders with naloxone, which can reverse the effects of an overdose. However, this bill didn't include any funding for the initiatives it authorized. The Cures Act takes that step, providing $1 billion for the Department of Health and Human Services to fund many of the prevention and treatment programs authorized by Congress earlier this year. Lastly, I would like to highlight the bill's provisions to improve our country's mental health system. This is an area where we fall far short. We don't do nearly enough to ensure those with mental illness are able to access appropriate treatment and this has ripple effects throughout society. In October, I was briefed on the homelessness crisis in Los Angeles and toured a shelter for homeless women. A significant percentage of the city's homeless population is battling mental illness. So, by improving our mental health system, we are also going to address connected issues like homelessness. Under the bill, Health and Human Services will develop a strategic plan to address mental health priorities. There is increased funding to train our doctors and nurses to better integrate substance abuse and mental health treatment into primary care visits. The bill also reauthorizes many important existing programs, including the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and the National Child Traumatic Stress Network, and increases support for mental health and drug courts. These innovative approaches to criminal justice provide an alternative process for individuals to receive and comply with needed treatment and are supported by the law enforcement community. The bill further provides for police training when police officers encounter individuals who exhibit mental illness. I recently convened meetings in Los Angeles and San Francisco with law enforcement and community leaders, and they all stressed the importance of deescalating situations with mentally ill individuals to make sure that situations do not end with violent encounters. In closing, I reiterate my support for the 21 Century Cures Act and urge its swift passage. This is a great opportunity to spur this century's medical innovation, improve access to needed treatments, and strengthen public health. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from Tennessee. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Kirk be recognized next and then Senator Murphy following him and that after that, I be recognized. We will be voting at 5:30. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Illinois. Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, 4 years ago I climbed the Capitol steps for those who could not. I vowed to return to the Senate to create and establish a standard of care for rehabilitation in this legislation to make sure many people can have access to the best rehab, as I did. With the passage of the Cures Act tomorrow, we will achieve this lofty goal. The Cures Act also contains bipartisan provisions to provide accelerated approval of regenerative medicines and therapies. The Regrow Act, which is also in this bill, is a major step forward so that Americans will not have to go to other countries for their own stem cells to be used in their own therapy. Making sure this faster approval process happens in this bill means that many more people will be able to receive advanced stem cell therapies that are also available overseas, right here at home. I would like to thank everybody. We have made progress with the FDA. I championed with Senators Collins and Manchin on this. I thank my senior colleague from Tennessee for all of his action on the Regrow Act so we can make the fundamental point of using your own stem cells to accelerate healing. In the case of using your own stem cells, they already have your exact DNA match. I think it is wise that we go through a shorter process. I thank the Senator for putting the Kirk language in the Regrow Act. I yield the floor. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, while we are waiting for Senator Murphy, let me salute Senator Kirk for his leadership from the very beginning. He has pointed out to the committee and the Senate that, as the Mayo Clinic has said, regenerative medicine is a game changer for stroke victims, for heart disease, and for people with retinal disease. Thanks to Senator Kirk, Senator Collins, Senator Manchin, and Senator McConnell, we have legislation that takes an important and responsible step forward to recognize the promise of regenerative medicine. This bill includes $30 million to the National Institutes of Health for clinical trials to support regenerative medicine. Then there are two other provisions in the bill. One of them allows the Food and Drug Administration to make regenerative therapeutic products eligible for the FDA's existing accelerated drug approval pathway. We have had great success over the last 4 or 5 years with an accelerated pathway for drugs, similar to what Senators Burr and Bennet and others got enacted into law. We are doing the same thing with combination drugs and devices in this legislation. Now Senator Kirk has added regenerative medicine to the accelerated pathway, and I salute him for that leadership. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois. Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I wish to remind my colleague, who is also the chairman of the Appropriations Energy Subcommittee that controls the exascale funding, one of the most complicated things we can face in our world is biological systems when we look at the new Aurora computer that is going to be built in the Argonne National Laboratories. I know that at Oak Ridge, we have exascale computers. My goal is to make sure we are always way ahead of the Chinese. In the case of Aurora, we now have $165 million to make sure that we have a computer that is far faster than the computer in China. With that, we will be able to model proteins themselves to make sure we make these advances much faster. My hope is that we will be [[Page S6694]] stunned at how much biological work is being done at the Oak Ridge lab with their leading computer to make sure we accelerate progress on this. Let me say one thing about the work of the Senator. Every piece of legislation that he touches goes through by a couple hundred votes. When we see Lamar take over a bill, we know it is going to be going through on a big walloping. He got a huge vote in the Senate, and I hope he gets a big vote again. Everything he touches turns to gold, and we cannot have a better friend in medical care than we have in Lamar Alexander. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois is very generous, and I thank him, but I would remind him that he was the persistent agent for the change in support for regenerative medicine. That wasn't easy to do, and he has been the leader, along with others of us who cared about the same thing, in making sure the United States maintains its lead in supercomputing competition around the world. Senator Murphy, the Senator from Connecticut, is coming. I think what I will do is begin, and when he comes I will stop and let him make his 5 minutes of remarks and then resume so I don't delay the vote because I know everyone is looking forward to casting a great big ``yes'' vote in a few minutes. The U.S. Senate majority leader, whose position in the Senate this is, has said more than once in private meetings I attended and on the floor of this body that the 21st Century Cures bill on which we will be voting in a few minutes is the most important legislation Congress will pass this year. In his address to the Nation this past weekend, President Obama urged us to vote for the bill today and tomorrow. ``It could help us find a cure for Alzheimer's,'' the President said. ``It could end cancer as we know it and help those seeking treatment for opioid addiction.'' The President continued: ``It's an opportunity to save lives and an opportunity we just can't miss.'' Vice President Biden has been telephoning Senators urging support for 21st Century Cures because, in the Vice President's words, it is a big step for cancer research and the Cancer Moonshot that is so close to his heart. Speaker Paul Ryan in the House of Representatives has made 21st Century Cures explicitly a centerpiece of his vision for our country's future, describing it as ``bipartisan legislation that would accelerate the discovery, development, and delivery of lifesaving treatments.'' With such bipartisan support from the President of the United States, the Vice President of the United States, the Speaker of the House, the Senate majority leader--two Democrats, two Republicans--it is no wonder that on last Wednesday, the House of Representatives approved 21st Century Cures by the overwhelming vote of 392 to 26. This legislation holds the promise of improving the life and health of virtually every family in the country. It will provide $4.8 billion in a one-time surge of funding for biomedical research in a time of breathtaking opportunity. It will advance Vice President Biden's Cancer Moonshot to find cures for cancer and President Obama's Precision Medicine Initiative, as well as the BRAIN Initiative. It will help move safe and effective treatments and cures through the development and regulatory process more rapidly, and it will lower costs, making medicines available sooner and hopefully also at lower costs to patients. It will provide $1 billion in grants to help deal with the raging opioid epidemic. It includes legislation to help the one in five adults in this country suffering from a mental illness, help them receive treatment by updating many of our country's mental health programs for the first time in a decade. It will improve health information technology for doctors who are eager to get rid of the overdocumentation of hospitals and their patients and help get the Nation's electronic health records system out of the ditch. From a taxpayer's point of view, it does all of these things in a fiscally responsible way by reducing other spending to pay for every penny of the $6.3 billion cost. I see the Senator from Connecticut on the floor, so I would like to suspend my remarks for 5 minutes so that he can make his, and then I would ask unanimous consent that the totality of my remarks follow his remarks. Before he speaks, let me just say once again how much I appreciate his leadership and that of Senator Cassidy and Senator Cornyn. One reason the majority leader calls this the most important piece of legislation Congress will act on this year is because it includes the mental health legislation that these Senators, including Senator Murphy, Senator Cornyn, and Senator Cassidy, have offered. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut. Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Alexander's kindness in allowing me to say a few words in support of this bill on behalf of myself and Senator Murray. I wish to congratulate Senator Alexander for once again showing how the Senate can work properly, how we can bring together Republicans and Democrats for a priority that really has nothing to do with whether one is a Republican or a Democrat or whether one voted for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. If people are out there suffering from a life-altering or potentially terminal disease or suffering from mental illness or addiction, they need help, and we are coming together in maybe one of the most important pieces of health legislation that has passed this Congress in a very long time to deliver that help. So I am not going to endeavor to recreate the remarks of Senator Alexander when it comes to describing the important aspects of this bill except to say that after passage of this bill, it is going to be a whole heck of a lot more likely that a life-changing, lifesaving drug is going to be able to make it to market in time to save a life. Every single one of the underlying reforms in this bill to the drug discovery process is bipartisan. I think about Senators Bennet and Hatch's bill, the promise for antibiotics and therapeutics for health, which establishes a new pathway for antibacterial and antifungal drugs that will treat serious, life-threatening infections for patients. I think about Senator Casey and Senator Isakson working on the Advancing Hope Act, which will extend the pediatric priority review voucher program until 2020. It incentivizes drug companies to research treatment for life-altering diseases that impact pediatric patients. Inside this bill are all sorts of good, important, bipartisan achievements. As Senator Alexander noted, there is also help on the way for people suffering from addiction. In my tiny little State--only 1 percent of the Nation's population--we are going to have over 800 people die this year from drug overdoses. Yes, we need to get to the source of that epidemic and stop people from getting addicted to pain medications in the first place, but, boy, we have an awful lot of people showing up with overdoses in our emergency rooms who have no place to go, have no detox programs, no long-term residential programs. The $1 billion authorized in this legislation to fight the opioid epidemic is going to save lives in my little State. Finally, when it comes to the issue of mental health--Senator Alexander, Senator Cassidy, and I were on the floor last week talking about this legislation; the focus on funding prevention, the focus on making sure parents are part of the care for their adult children, the focus on ensuring that insurance companies really do pay attention to the Parity Act we passed 10 years ago in this Congress to assure that you get covered for mental illness just like physical illness. A broken leg really isn't any different than a broken brain when we think about it. We can treat both. These are important advances in mental health as well. I know this place has a bad reputation; that people pay attention to the fights here more often than they do to the moments where we get together and cooperate. The 21st Century Cures Act that Senator Murray and Senator Alexander, with help from Senator Cornyn, me, Senator Cassidy, and in the House Congressmen Upton, Pallone, Tim Murphy, and Eddie Bernice Johnson--this is an example of how this place can work better. As we head in to what may be a very charged atmosphere in January, I hope we remember this moment. I wanted to [[Page S6695]] come down on behalf of Senator Murray, who has helped shepherd this process, to congratulate Senator Alexander on it and recommend its passage to all of my colleagues. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his words, support, and his leadership this year. I thank also Senator Murray from Washington. She would be here, except her plane is delayed. The vote will be held open to make sure she can be here, but Senator Murray is a Member of the Democratic leadership and well respected on that side of the aisle but also on this side of the aisle because, when she can, she creates an environment where we can do today exactly what we are doing today. I think the American people appreciate that, and Senator Murphy and I both benefit from that. I thank the Senator for those remarks and will now continue my remarks. At a Senate hearing earlier this year, Dr. Francis Collins, the distinguished head of the National Institutes of Health--an agency he calls the ``National Institutes of Hope''--offered ``bold predictions'' about major advances to expect in the next 10 years from sustained investments in biomedical research, such as we are doing with this bill. One prediction is that scientists will find ways to identify individuals at risk for Alzheimer's even before symptoms appear, as well as how to slow or even prevent the disease. Today, Alzheimer's causes untold family grief and costs $236 billion a year. Left unchecked, the cost in 2050 would be more than our Nation spends on national defense. Dr. Collins' other predictions are equally breathtaking. Using stem cells, doctors could use a patient's own cells to rebuild his or her heart. This personalized rebuilt heart, Dr. Collins says, would make transplant waiting lists and anti-rejection drugs obsolete. He expects development of an artificial pancreas to help diabetes patients by tracking blood glucose levels and creating precise doses of insulin. He says a Zika vaccine should be widely available by 2018, with universal flu vaccine and HIV/AIDS vaccine available within the decade. To relieve suffering and deal with the epidemic of opioid addiction that led to 28,000 overdose deaths in America in 2014, he predicts new nonaddictive medicines to manage pain, an even more effective antidote than the $1 billion we would be authorizing by our votes today. These truly would be miracles. The bill has taken more than 2 years to assemble both in the Senate and the House. There have been major differences of opinion, but the resolution of those differences--thanks to Senator Murray and many other Senators--has been bipartisan every step of the way. We saw that on display in the work of the President, the Vice President, the Speaker of the House, and the Senate majority leader. We saw it in the House with its vote of 392 to 26 last week, thanks especially to the leadership of Chairman Upton, Ranking Member Pallone, and Representative DeGette. We saw it in our Senate Health Committee, where we approved 19 bills that include 50 proposals, and every one with both a Democratic and Republican sponsor, except for 1 bill offered solely by Senator Murray, who is the ranking Democratic member of our committee. We have a diverse committee of 22 Members--that would be an understatement, actually--some of the most liberal Members and some of the most conservative Members, but when our committee considered these 19 bills during our 3 markups held over several months, the largest number of votes against any one of these 19 bipartisan bills was 2. Let me say that again. The largest number of votes--recorded votes--against any one of these 19 bipartisan bills was 2 in our committee of 22. Here is what some of those 19 bipartisan bills--again, approved unanimously or by a wide margin--would do to help move safe and effective treatments and cures more rapidly through the regulatory process and into patients' medicine cabinets and into doctors' offices. For example, Senators Bennet, Warren, Burr, and Hatch's act would allow researchers to use their own data from previously approved therapies when they submit for review a treatment or cure for serious rare genetic diseases, like Duchenne's, a rare kind of muscular dystrophy that could impact children as young as 3. Senators Burr and Franken's legislation will help to bring innovative medical devices--such as artificial knees, insulin pumps, and heart stents--to patients more quickly by getting rid of unnecessary burdens in medical device evaluations and streamlining the review process for clinical trials. Senators Baldwin and Collins have a bill to improve opportunities for our young researchers, essential to advancing biomedical research. Senator Kirk just talked about his legislation with Bennet, Hatch, Murkowski, Isakson, and Collins to improve rehabilitation research and help the approximately 800,000 Americans who suffer a stroke each year. Senators Isakson, Murphy, Casey, Wicker, and Vitter will help advance our understanding of neurological diseases. Senator Murray, as I mentioned earlier, will clarify that the FDA requires cleaning and validation data for reusable medical devices. Senators Murray, Hatch, Bennet, Cassidy and Whitehouse's bill will improve health information technology for doctors and their patients. We had six hearings on medical information technology programs in a ditch. We think we are helping to get them out of the ditch. We have been working with the Obama administration to do that, and I look forward to working with the Trump administration to continue that. Senators Burr, Bennet, Hatch, and Donnelly would speed safe breakthrough devices, putting senior people in charge of the review process. Casey, Isakson, Brown, and Kirk's legislation. If you are the parent of a child with a rare disease like brain cancer, their bill would increase the likelihood that your child will be able to take a drug that will help by giving a drug company that develops a drug for such a disease a voucher they could keep or sell that would speed up the review of another drug. One may say this is getting boring. This is too long. It is not boring to the millions of Americans who stand to benefit from this, and it is exactly the kind of work we ought to be doing in the United States Senate and what the American people would like to see us do more of. The Medical Electronic Data Technology Enhancement Act, with Senators Bennet and Hatch and many others interested in that. Senators Burr and Casey and Isakson and Roberts have important legislation for planning ahead for events like bioterror attacks, to help protect against anthrax, for example, or smallpox. The Combination Products Innovation Act, with a number of Senators involved on the committee, will help prevent the growing field of combination products--like bandaids with Neosporin built in or a heart stent that can be implanted to deliver blood thinners to prevent clots--from being caught in redtape. Then there is legislation that will give patients and their families a voice in drug development. There is one that is a top priority for the heads of FDA and NIH which will help those agencies attract and keep the kind of talent they need to approve all these exciting advances that are coming. There is legislation to shorten the development of new treatments to help those affected with life-threatening superbugs. The Advancing Precision Medicine Act, which Senator Murray and I cosponsored, is in direct support of President Obama's initiative to map 1 million genomes so researchers can develop treatments and cures tailored to a patient's genome. There are five or six other major pieces of legislation that I will include in the Record but not read at this time because we are approaching the time for a vote, but let me conclude by saying that in addition to these bipartisan policies, the 21st Century Cures bill includes $6.3 billion in funding. We usually don't attach such funding to a bill authorizing programs. We usually work [[Page S6696]] along two tracks; one track for authorizing programs and one deciding how much to spend on those programs. During the last 2 years, while we have been working on our authorizing legislation, our appropriations committees have recommended major increases in support for biomedical research, and it is important that every Senator know this. In the current year, at the urging of Senators Blunt and Senator Murray, Congress added $2 billion a year to the $32 billion budget of the National Institutes of Health, which could total $20 billion over 10 years. Then, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended another $2 billion increase for the next fiscal year, 2017, which could total another $20 billion over 10 years. This 21st Century Cures legislation adds $4.8 billion in a surge of one-time spending for the National Institutes of Health on top of the regular appropriated money toward key objectives: $1.8 billion for the Cancer Moonshot, $1.4 billion for precision medicine, $1.6 for the BRAIN Initiative, and it adds $1 billion for State grants to help States fight the opioid abuse epidemic. I believe that for every State represented by a Senator here tonight, the opioid epidemic is on the front pages of the newspapers. It adds $500 million for the Food and Drug Administration, and 21st Century Cures also gives the National Institutes of Health $30 million for clinical trials to support regenerative medicine, which the Mayo Clinic has described as a ``game- changing area of medicine with the potential to fully heal damaged tissues and organs, offering solutions and hope for people who have conditions that are beyond repair.'' It gives the FDA authority to allow regenerative therapeutic products to be eligible for FDA's existing accelerated drug approval pathway. I wish to acknowledge the work of Speaker Ryan and Leader McConnell in designing a way to secure funding that both Democrats and Republicans can accept. That is not always easy. For those concerned about additional spending--often on our side of the aisle--Speaker Ryan and House Budget Chairman Tom Price made sure the funding is one time, not mandatory, paid for, and approved each year by Appropriations Committees. It doesn't add one penny to the overall budget because for every increase in the discretionary budget, we reduce the same amount in the mandatory ledger. For those who worry that Congress might not approve the $6.3 billion in additional spending in later years--I have heard a little of that from the other side of the aisle--my answer is that the best way to ensure the money is spent in the following years is a big vote today and tomorrow when we finally pass the bill, just as the House did last week. In conclusion, it will be hard to explain why you voted to spend $6.3 billion for cancer, the Precision Medicine Initiative, and opioids this year but then voted not to spend it next year, and the legislation provides that the money cannot be diverted for any other purpose than what we vote for today and tomorrow. In addition, this year's portion of Cures funding--including one-half billion for opioid grants--is included in the continuing resolution that we will vote on later this week. This is the kind of lasting legacy the President of the United States and our Congress can be proud of. The next administration or the next Congress will not be repealing this law because we have taken the time to work out our differences and create a consensus of support. We did this at this time last year with an equally complicated bill to fix No Child Left Behind, which, despite its complexities, received 85 votes in this body. When he signed it, the President called it a ``Christmas miracle.'' The 21st Century Cures bill will present President Obama with another Christmas miracle, one that will help virtually every family. When we pass this legislation, the real winners will be the American families whose lives will be improved by this bipartisan legislation. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, with the permission of my distinguished chairman, who has worked very hard on this bill and whose efforts I appreciate very much, I wanted to add, very briefly, that I hope very much and look forward to working with my colleagues to assure that the second tranche of the opioid funding is aligned with the CARA bill, or the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, which we just passed in such bipartisan fashion a few months ago. We have not achieved that alignment yet, and I hope that we do very soon. I appreciate the terrific efforts of my chairman. With that, I yield. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The VICE PRESIDENT.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah. Remembering James Tancill Lyons Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Jim Lyons, a longtime staffer on Capitol Hill--my staffer--and a fixture in tax policy here in DC, who passed away on September 29 of this year. James Tancill Lyons was born on March 7, 1973, to Stephen and Ann Lyons, both natives of the DC-Virginia area with longstanding ties to the local community. Growing up in Springfield, VA, Jim was an accomplished athlete, excelling in both baseball and basketball. Oddly, for a sports fan in the DC area, his favorite football team was the Dallas Cowboys--a decision he made consciously because his older brother, Stephen, was a big Redskins fan. Jim was also a great student, eventually graduating summa cum laude from James Madison University. He went to law school at the University of Texas, where he made the Editing Committee of the Texas Journal of Business Law and won a scholarship for being the best tax law student in his class after pulling the top grade in his business associations, income tax, international tax, corporate tax, and estate and gift tax classes. After law school, he earned a clerkship at the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and then got a job working for Cleary Gottlieb, one of the finest law firms in the country. Of course, you would never guess any of this if you knew Jim. While he was always an incredibly valuable and often brilliant attorney and congressional staffer, he talked about his college and law school days as though he spent most of his time having fun and just barely skating by. That, of course, was vintage Jim Lyons--incredibly outgoing but unbelievably humble. Jim could have a long conversation with anyone about pretty much anything, but he was never one to spend all that much time touting his own accomplishments. Make no mistake, Jim Lyons was very accomplished. After his time at the law firm in New York, Jim made his way to the House Ways and Means Committee, and, following a brief subsequent and successful stint at the Department of Justice, he was hired by Chairman Chuck Grassley to serve as tax counsel on the Senate Finance Committee. In his 8 years on the Finance Committee, he made a mark on every major tax bill, not to mention a number of debt and budget deals that went through the Senate, including many tax-extenders bills, some of which he seemed to be able to cobble together singlehandedly. [[Page S6687]] Jim was smart as a whip. He was a tremendously valuable congressional staffer because he had both a remarkable understanding of tax policy and an uncanny ability to see all the traps and pitfalls that stood ahead for any particular proposal or piece of legislation. He had an encyclopedic knowledge of the technical aspects of the Tax Code, as well as a clear understanding of the real-world implications, immediately seeing where a particular tax policy or bill would fit in the larger policy and, when necessary, the political landscape. Jim was one of those people who could go into the weeds to discuss, debate, and negotiate tax policy literally with anyone on the planet but also break that same policy down to its essential elements and explain it to lesser mortals, including, I have to say, more than a few of us U.S. Senators. Of course, like all of us, Jim had his own ideological views and opinions, and he made no secret about the way he saw the world and his beliefs about the best path forward for our country. When necessary, he was a fierce advocate for his own views, but more importantly, for someone in his position, he was able, when necessary, to dispassionately apply his accrued knowledge and expertise to any tax proposal, whether it came from a conservative or liberal or a Republican or Democrat, and then break it down to its essence and give a clear and concise assessment of the policy and its chances for being enacted. All of this made him an essential and indispensable part of our efforts on the Senate Finance Committee for close to a decade. As I think all of my colleagues will attest, staffers with that kind of knowledge and ability to evaluate policy and lay out its chances for success really can be hard to come by. However, in the weeks since Jim's passing, it hasn't been his accomplishments or his knowledge of the Tax Code that people have most remembered; instead, most of the focus has been on his friendly demeanor, his mischievous sense of humor, and most of all, his kind heart. Dozens of Jimmy's friends and colleagues visited Jim and his family in the hospital during his final days, and during the October recess, hundreds attended a memorial service held here in the Capitol. Each one of these people had at least one personal story to share about Jim. Sure, some of the stories did touch on his successes as a staffer and his professional disposition, but far more often the stories were about Jim's kindness, even to strangers, or his ability to make people feel at ease--and sometimes laugh uncontrollably--even in tense situations. Jim was always quick to offer assistance and comfort to those in need and to provide a much needed laugh when things got really tough. He is one of very few people I have come across on Capitol Hill--and keep in mind I have been here a while--who will be remembered more or less equally for the bills he successfully drafted and negotiated and for the way he cracked everyone up at the negotiating table. I think my favorite story I have heard about Jim came from his mother Ann. In 2003, Jim was living in New York City when much of that part of the country suffered a massive blackout. It is difficult to be in a place like New York without power, and Jim noticed many people on his way home who were stranded and in need of assistance. Rather than look down at the ground and head quickly for home, as many would probably want to do in that situation, Jim offered help to a dozen or so people, bringing them all home to his apartment, giving them both food and a comfortable space to ride out the power outage. Most of these people were strangers. Yet Jim, ever the kind soul, offered his time and his home to help them through a difficult evening. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of pages 14 and 15 from the August 2003 edition of Cleargolaw News, a newsletter for the law firm where Jim worked at that time, be printed in the Record following my remarks. The article tells the story of Jim's efforts during the power blackout. These are the types of stories that have constantly been shared since Jim's passing, and I know these memories and stories from people who knew and worked with Jim have been helpful to his family during this difficult time. When I hear these accounts of people's interactions with Jim, I am reminded of a popular hymn in my church, which reads: Each life that touches ours for good Reflects thine own great mercy, Lord; Thou sendest blessings from above Thru words and deeds of those who love. What greater gift dost thou bestow, What greater goodness can we know Than Christ-like friends, whose gentle ways Strengthen our faith, enrich our days. When such a friend from us departs, We hold forever in our hearts A sweet and hallowed memory, Bringing us nearer, Lord, to thee. Jim Lyons led a life which touched many others for the better. His positive influence has been felt by countless people, pretty much anyone who had the opportunity to interact with him. I personally already miss Jim's stalwart presence on the Finance Committee. I miss his wise and plain-spoken advice and unequalled knowledge of tax policy. More than that, I miss the kind and humorous manner that endeared Jim to so many of us working in and around the Senate. There is a simple quote--an anonymous proverb of sorts--that has often been attributed to Dr. Seuss, though its origin is ultimately in dispute: ``Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened.'' Over the past couple of months, I think that has been the prevailing sentiment among those of us who were lucky enough to know Jim Lyons. While tears have been shed and great sadness has been felt, the remembrances we have had of Jim's life and our interactions with him have given all of us reason to smile and even laugh. I want to once again express my condolences to Jim's family, his parents Stephen and Ann, his brother Steve, his two nephews, Tyler and Blake, and of course his beloved dog Buddy. Recently, I have had the opportunity to spend time with and get to know Jim's wonderful family. They are truly extraordinary people, and my prayers continue to go out to them. I know I am not alone in that regard. I care for them. Everybody who knew Jim and has now known them cares for them. Our sympathy and our heartfelt thanks go out to them for allowing their son to become the great person he became, and, of course, allowing him to come and work with us on Capitol Hill. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Thank You for Taking Care of Us (By Alice Steinert) Here is a wonderfully refreshing story about a truly good, kind person. The day of the blackout was scary for some, devastating for others, and just plain inconvenient for many. There are those of us who still have thighs and calves that ache from all those flights of stairs! Many people could not get home that night for a number of reasons--1) after walking down that many flights of stairs, some people were a bit lame and therefore could not walk the distance to their homes, or their homes were too far to walk to; 2) there were few, if any, buses, taxi cabs, cars, trains, ferries, no subways, and no hotel vacancies; 3) etc., etc., etc. But, for those of us fortunate enough to know Jim Lyons, CGSH Associate extraordinaire, we certainly know the meaning of the true human spirit. Jim invited many people to his home that day when we had to evacuate OLP. He provided an immediate ``base'' for people to relax, calm down, regroup, make contact with family/friends, eat, drink, whatever they needed. But, for nine of us (Ron Becton, Robert Franklin, Monica Gagnon, Glenville Hunter, Amy Menendez, Alice Steinert, Jason Steinert, Naj-Lah Toussaint and Carol Whatley), he provided much, much more. He provided a safe haven for the night. At about 7:45 P.M. Jim walked from his home to OLP to see if there was anyone else in need of assistance. Well, he found nine of us who were seriously thinking about bunking down for the night in front of the lobby doors. Without hesitation Jim invited all of us to his home (he had never even met some of us before). Not only did he provide us with a roof over our heads, he also offered food and beverage, the use of his cell phone, pillows and blankets, and even gave up his bed to two of us ladies. Not only that, he bought toothbrushes for us; What ensued was a night we will all remember--good people, stimulating conversation, a lot of fun, and a great deal of bonding and comeraderie. While we will individually, and as a group, thank Jim, I think everyone in the firm should recognize what an exceptional person Jim is. If there were more ``Jim's'' in the world, what a different place it would be. God Bless You Jim. Remembering King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today, December 5, 2016, in commemoration of the 89th birthday of the late [[Page S6688]] King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand and in recognition of the National Day of Thailand. In remembrance of the extraordinary life, steady leadership, and remarkable 70-year reign of the beloved King Bhumibol, I have introduced S. Con. Res. 57, along with Representative Matt Salmon in the House. This resolution honors the late King's lasting legacy, extends our collective condolences to the royal family and the people of Thailand, and celebrates the alliance and friendship between our two nations. I would like to thank the cosponsors of this resolution, Senators Whitehouse, Roberts, Markey, Flake, Cotton, and Gardner. Additionally, I express my appreciation to Chairman Bob Corker for his assistance in receiving timely consideration of this bipartisan effort in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. His Majesty, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, enjoyed a special relationship with the United States, having been born in Cambridge, MA, in 1927, while his father was completing his medical studies at Harvard University. He was always a trusted friend of the United States in advancing a strong and enduring alliance and partnership between our two countries. At the time of his death on October 13, 2016, King Bhumibol Adulyadej was the longest serving head of state in the world and the longest serving in the history of Thailand. He dedicated his life to the well- being of the Thai people and the sustainable development of his country. His Majesty was an anchor of peace and stability for Thailand and for the region, earning him the deep reverence of the Thai people and the respect of leaders around the world. I hope my colleagues will join me tomorrow in passing S. Con. Res. 57 as a gesture of respect and appreciation for the life of this great leader and as a symbol of our continued commitment to and friendship with Thailand. Additionally, I am sure my colleagues in the Senate will join me in offering our warmest congratulations and best wishes to the new King of Thailand, His Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Passage Vitiated--H.R. 5602, S. 3336, and Calendar Nos. 675 through 683 Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to vitiate passage of H.R. 5602, S. 3336, and Calendar Nos. 675 through 683. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Farewell to the Senate Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the Senate floor for the last time. I am not generally big on nostalgic reminiscences, but I would like to briefly reflect on what is clearly the greatest honor of my professional life--my 12 years in the U.S. Senate and 5\1/ 2\ years in the U.S. House of Representatives and the enormous honor of serving the people of Louisiana to whom I will always be so deeply indebted. In some ways it seems like just yesterday that I was on the floor of the U.S. House being sworn in, surrounded by our very young children, except for Jack, who wasn't born yet. I said then: ``I am honored, humbled, awestruck to stand before you today.'' I stated my simple goal: to become at ease and comfortable as I learn the ways of Congress, as I hopefully become an effective representative and respected colleague and friend, but never to become so at ease and comfortable that I lose these feelings of honor, of humility, of awe, and, believe me, I haven't. My very first year in the Senate was a very memorable one. That year Louisiana was struck by Hurricanes Rita and Katrina. After the initial shock of those cataclysmic events, I realized that for quite some time, my priorities as Louisiana Senator would be dominated by the desperate need to rebuild our State, including dramatically improving our hurricane and flood protection and restoring our coastline. Katrina's devastation was hard to imagine, destroying much of Southeast Louisiana and Coastal Mississippi. Less than 1 month later, Hurricane Rita slammed into Southwest Louisiana as another one of the most intense hurricanes in history. I immediately went to work with Senator Landrieu and the rest of our Louisiana delegation as well as my good friends Thad Cochran, Trent Lott, and others to secure the necessary disaster recovery assistance and also to make reforms to the Army Corps of Engineers to better protect our families and communities from future natural disasters. Louisiana has continued to face and survive other major disasters, including Hurricane Gustav in August and September 2008, Hurricane Ike in September of that same year, Hurricane Isaac in 2012, the Red River flooding in Northern and Central Louisiana, and the 1,000-year-flood event in greater Baton Rouge and Acadiana this past August. As if all of that weren't enough, in April of 2010, the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded off the coast of Louisiana, killing 11 men and devastating our coastline. The disaster, followed by the horribly misguided offshore drilling moratorium President Obama put in place, caused economic and environmental chaos in Louisiana. Once again, I immediately went to work with so many others to increase and improve safety measures and reopen the Gulf of Mexico to energy exploration and put people back to work. We introduced legislation to dedicate a majority of the BP penalties toward restoring coastal ecosystems and economies damaged by the spill. It was an uphill battle to ensure Louisiana was fairly compensated, but we did, and we achieved substantial wins, including passage of that critical RESTORE Act that I described. During the recovery fight following each of these disasters, I found that the most effective leadership involved communicating clearly and employing solutions based on Louisiana common sense, and what always inspired me and kept me going was the unbelievable resilience, faith, and determination of my fellow Louisianans. Their strength and optimism have been oh so powerful reminders of how blessed I have been to serve them. On a host of other important issues, I always sought to further two sets of political values, really modeled after my two favorite Presidents, Ronald Reagan and Teddy Roosevelt. I always strove to further the central American tradition of limited government and individual freedom, and I was never afraid to shake things up, to demand needed reforms to ensure that leaders in Washington served the American people and not the other way around. I have had the honor of protecting Louisiana's traditions and proud heritage while here in the Senate. Louisianans love the outdoors and want strong environmental conservation and sportsmen's policies to maintain that culture, and that certainly includes securing the rights afforded to each American by the Second Amendment, which I have fought to do. Louisianans respect the sanctity of life, which has been one of my top priorities while serving in Congress. I have introduced many bills that end taxpayer funding of abortion and abortion mills and have proudly stood in the defense of life. When it comes to our Nation's immigration policies, I have been an advocate for targeted reforms that fix the immigration crisis, starting with border security and enforcing the immigration laws already on the books. I fought President Obama's unconstitutional attempts to implement Executive amnesty, which only encourages more immigrants to come here illegally and insults the millions of fine immigrants who do follow U.S. law. I was also the first to introduce legislation in 2007 to end dangerous sanctuary city policies and have continued to do so each Congress since. I have also been critical of too big to fail in the banking sector and have found [[Page S6689]] banking reform to be an area in which Republicans can absolutely find common ground with Democrats. That is where I found success in passing into law specific measures that restrict too-big-to-fail and tax-funded bailouts. Also during my time in Congress, I have introduced several important government reform bills so we can get back to the best traditions of our democracy, which includes electing citizen legislators, making sure they don't make themselves into a separate ruling class, and advocating for term limits so individuals don't remain in office for an eternity. Americans of all backgrounds think Washington is on a different planet and Members of Congress just don't get it. That is why I fought to end Congress's automatic pay raises each year. I first introduced that language in 2009, and the raises have been successfully blocked each year since. Congress can be an effective representative body only when it lives under the same laws it imposes on the rest of the country, and one major way to support that is through term limits. When I was a member of the Louisiana State legislature, I was successful in establishing legislative term limits there, and I have offered the leading term limits measure for Congress here, as well as imposing it on myself. I fought for commonsense legislation that helps all Americans have access to high-quality and affordable health care. That includes the work to dismantle ObamaCare and replace it with patient-centered health care reform, which I am very hopeful the incoming Trump administration will achieve. In the meantime, I have been fighting to end Washington's exemption from ObamaCare, an illegal Obama administration Executive order that allows Washington elites to avoid the most inconvenient, expensive aspects of the Affordable Care Act by giving themselves taxpayer subsidized health care through an exchange meant solely for small businesses. Also in the health care arena, I was able to pass into law the bipartisan Steve Gleason Act of 2015. It provided immediate relief for patients who have been denied access to lifesaving and life-altering medical equipment. It was about a 2014 Medicare policy change that we had to reverse. Our bill allowed these patients to have access to medical equipment that truly empowers them, that is a true lifeline, and it changes their lives absolutely for the better. I have also fought against large drug manufacturing lobbies to allow for reimportation of safe and approved prescription medicine from other countries, which gives patients, especially our seniors, relief from rising health care costs. I have been honored to serve in the Senate in additional ways as well, including as a top Republican on the Environment and Public Works Committee and most recently as chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. I am very proud to say that we have accomplished so many of our goals in those two roles. We worked in a bipartisan fashion on EPW to pass several major pieces of legislation, including the Water Resources and Development Act of 2007 and the even more significant WRDA of 2014, several reauthorizations of the highway bill, the bipartisan and historic rewrite of the 40-year-old Toxic Substances Control Act, which began as conversations between Senator Frank Lautenberg and myself, a partnership which Senator Tom Udall continued after Frank's unfortunate passing. We were also able to hold the administration accountable by conducting investigations into some outright corruption within the Obama EPA, and we advanced key transparency initiatives that shed light on government's attempts to implement policies that were not based on sound science or strategic needs. As chair of the Small Business Committee, I have been advocating to make sure the voices and concerns of small business owners across the country are heard in Washington. We have held 23 hearings here, 18 field hearings, numerous roundtable discussions. We have heard testimony from over 175 witnesses, usually about the disastrous negative effects of Obama policies like the new waters of the United States rule, key and disastrous effects on small businesses and job creators and their employees. At the very same time, we found common ground with Ranking Member Shaheen and other Democrats on the committee. During my tenure as chair, we passed 32 bipartisan bills out of the committee, which is 22 more than my predecessors did over a much longer period, and 8 of our bills have passed through the entire legislative process and have been signed into law. These accomplishments are but a fraction of the years of hard work my staff and I have dedicated to the people of Louisiana and, indeed, the American people. I have worked hard to be a champion for them because the government should serve the taxpayer and not the other way around, and that includes by working hard to stay in touch through 398 townhall meetings, at least 5 in each parish of Louisiana, through 231 telephone townhalls, and through active, energetic casework and constituent service. Clearly what I will treasure most about my service here is the people with whom I have been honored to serve; my colleagues, including my fellow Louisianian Senator Bill Cassidy, mentors like former Senator Rick Santorum and Senator Jeff Sessions, and most especially each of the dedicated people who have been part of Team Vitter. I have come to the Senate floor several times this year to thank key departing staff members. That is for a very simple reason. My staff has been the key ingredient--the key--to every success we have enjoyed together in public service. Wendy and I consider them a part of the family. I truly thank my staff again for their tireless, dedicated service to Louisiana. I am so very grateful. Wendy joins me in that. I want to specifically recognize some of our leaders: my chief of staff, Luke Bolar; my legislative director, Chris Stanley; my wonderful finance director, Courtney Guastela; our state director, Chip Layton; and committee staff director, Meredith West; our grants coordinator, Brenda Moore; my media head, John Brabender; and senior infrastructure policy advisor, Charles Brittingham; my senior economic adviser, David Stokes; campaign treasurer Bill Vanderbrook; and communications director, Cheyenne Klotz. I know a few of our other former senior staff members are here or are watching, like Mac Abrams, Joel DiGrado, Bryan Zumwalt, Travis Johnson, and Michael Long. Last, and obviously not least, is my beloved family. My five wonderful brothers and sisters, our children, their children, the extended family, led by the ultimate leader of Team Vitter, my wife Wendy. I can never thank them enough, and certainly I can never ever thank Wendy enough. Through it all, Wendy has been so enormously patient and supportive and understanding, not to mention being the life of every Team Vitter party, leading the rounds--rounds plural--of Fireball shots. She and our daughter Lise are in the Gallery today. I thank them and Sophie, Airey, and Jack for decades of love and support. Lise, up there, was in my arms as a 2-year-old when I was first sworn into the House of Representatives and made those previously quoted remarks: ``I am honored, humbled, awestruck to stand before you.'' She has changed some, but as I said at the beginning of my reflections, those feelings certainly have not. I would like to close as I did that day in the House over 17 years ago; that is, simply by recognizing the wonderful, loving forces that have brought me here today: God, family, led by my parents up above, and my wife Wendy, staff and friends, and of course the wonderful, wonderful people of Louisiana. They are here with me today. They are here with me always. I thank them from the depths of my heart. For the last time, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana. Tribute to David Vitter Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I have the honor to recognize and thank my colleague and friend, the Honorable Senator David Vitter, for his 25 years of service to Louisiana. Our State has been fortunate to have him as its voice and advocate in this Chamber for the past 12 years. On a personal note, when I arrived at the Senate, David worked with me, sharing with me some of the privileges that normally he, as a senior Senator, [[Page S6690]] could have kept all to himself. With great graciousness, he worked with me and said: Listen, this is how I think the process should be set up. I would like you to have some of this privilege as well. I will do the same with whoever replaces David. He has set a pattern that, again, by his graciousness and magnanimity, deserves repetition. As a new Senator, I was fortunate to have him as a resource for advice and knowledge that comes from time and experience in this body. There are some things that happen here that you have to kind of have experience to follow. David had both the experience, the sharpness, and the insight to recognize. I again look forward to sharing what he has taught me with whoever takes his place. I will note, as David did, he helped lead our State through some of our worst times. From Hurricane Katrina in 2005 to the great flood of 2016, all of the way in between, David has worked hard to make sure Louisiana and the people of Louisiana have what they need to recover. The hallmark of Senator Vitter's tenure is that he has always cared deeply about our State, constantly looking for what he could do that would benefit our State, not just in the short term but doing that which is consistent with his principles to help Louisiana and the United States thrive in the long term. He has been on the side of that family whose father goes for 2 weeks, works on an oil rig in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico, working hard so his family has a better future. David has been on the side of that mom juggling two jobs to earn enough to make sure her children's needs are met. A recent example--again for the short-term and long-term perspective David handled so well--he stayed persistent for years working across the aisle, first with Senator Frank Lautenberg, then Senator Udall, to pass the much needed reform of the Toxic Substances Control Act, the first reform of its kind in 40 years. This reform protects both the workers--those people on that rig, perhaps, at least the people who would be processing the products of that rig--but also gives the manufacturers of Louisiana and across the country the certainty they need to expand their businesses and create more jobs. On a lighter note, David is a great Saints fan. We in Louisiana kind of liked the fact that when the slogan ``Who Dat'' came up spontaneously, and people started to put it on their shirts and the NFL was going to go court to stop this from happening, David wrote a letter to Roger Goddell. The letter started off by saying: ``Who Dat.'' So speaking truth to power on behalf of the ``Who Dat Nation'' is one credit of his. Similarly, David was tweeting before our President-elect made it perhaps as high profile. I remember during the 2013 Super Bowl in New Orleans--and again the context of this is, the Saints had just been punished--of course Saints fans think unfairly--by Roger Goddell. So during the 2013 Super Bowl in New Orleans, when the power went out, David's tweet, without missing a beat said: ``Like most Saints fans, I am immediately assuming Roger Goddell is the chief suspect for the power outage.'' The quick-witted quip cut to the emotion of the ``Who Dat Nation.'' As the 114th Congress comes to a close, the Senate will be losing an important Member. David brings a sound, strategic mind to this Chamber that will be missed. I wish him, Wendy, their children, Lise, Sophie, Airey, and Jack, the best of luck in their journey forward. On behalf of all Louisiana, I say thank you. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana. Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana for his very kind remarks. More importantly, I want to thank him for years of great partnership, great work on behalf of Louisiana. I know he will make an outstanding senior Senator. Thank you. I yield the floor. Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the 21st Century Cures Act, and I commend the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, Senator Lamar Alexander and Senator Patty Murray, for their unwavering commitment to this very significant bipartisan legislation. The Senate HELP Committee, on which I am privileged to serve, has devoted considerable time and effort to this comprehensive legislation. It includes many reforms and priorities that will benefit so many families across our great country. The 21st Century Cures Act will support the research and development of safe treatments and cures for millions of Americans and their families who are coping with devastating diseases. It will improve the process of moving new discoveries from laboratory benches to patient bedsides. I doubt that there is a family in America who will not be touched by this important legislation in some way. All of us have a family member, a coworker, or a friend who has courageously faced the struggles of living with a debilitating chronic illness or a rare disease or who has received a devastating diagnosis and has passed away far too soon, leaving a hole in our hearts. Imagine how this could change with the passage of the 21st Century Cures Act and strong support of the research and development that will lead to new treatments and therapies that can help us achieve our dream of conquering so many devastating diseases. Simply put, this legislation matters. It matters to the children who know firsthand the burden of living with type 1 diabetes and who beg their parents for just one day off--their birthday or Christmas--from having to deal with the consequences of their juvenile diabetes. It matters to the family members who know the agonizing experience of looking into the eyes of a loved one suffering from Alzheimer's disease, only to receive a confused look in return. It matters to the parents of young boys who have Duchenne muscular dystrophy, who know what it is like to give their all in an effort to help their sons achieve their dreams, whether it is finishing college or driving a car, even as every day their children battle the progression of this debilitating and ultimately terminal illness. The 21st Century Cures Act will drive progress in medical innovation so that we can prevail against these diseases and many more that cause so much pain and suffering, so much fear and uncertainty, and so much heartbreak. There simply is no investment that we can make that provides greater return for Americans than our investment in biomedical research. It not only leads to new discoveries and the development of better treatments and even cures but also can have a dramatic effect on the budgets of families, States, and the Federal Government. The bill before us will help direct $4.8 billion to the National Institutes of Health, including $1.6 billion for the BRAIN Initiative to improve our understanding of diseases such as ALS, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's, our Nation's most costly disease. We spend $263 billion a year caring for people with Alzheimer's disease. Of that amount, approximately $160 billion comes from the Medicare and Medicaid Programs. If the current trajectory continues as our population grows older, this disease will bankrupt the Medicare and Medicaid Programs. That is why I am so pleased to see the BRAIN Initiative funded in this bill and also the work we are doing in the Appropriations Committee to boost funding for Alzheimer's disease and other dementias so that we can finally find effective treatments, a means of prevention, or perhaps even a cure for this disease that brings so much heartache not only to those suffering from it but to their families as well. Our bill will also help provide $1.8 billion for the Vice President's Cancer Moonshot. We all know that Vice President Biden has taken on this cause--a very personal one for him--because he lost his beloved son Beau to cancer. Another exciting field that will be funded by this bill is $30 million for regenerative medicine, using adult stem [[Page S6691]] cells. How exciting it was to have an individual come before our policy lunch whose sight had been restored due to innovative stem cell surgery. This individual lives in Tennessee now but happens to be from Presque Isle, ME, just 13 miles from where I was born and grew up. How I wish so many older people in this country who are losing their vision to macular degeneration and glaucoma--in some cases, a combination of both--or injuries to their eyes could benefit from this exciting development with adult stem cells, which has restored the sight of someone who was legally blind. He now can drive. That is so exciting, and that is the promise of researching regenerative medicine. In addition to support for NIH, the 21st Century Cures Act will help direct $1 billion in much needed funding to address the horrendous heroin and opioid abuse problem in this country. Maine has been particularly hard hit by this epidemic. In just the first 9 months of this year, Maine experienced a record 286 overdose deaths. That is more than one a day. Tragically, that number already exceeds the 272 overdose deaths in Maine during all of 2015. I am distressed when I hear about the lack of treatment options for Mainers who are struggling with drug addiction, particularly in rural areas. As a result of the shortage of treatment alternatives, this epidemic is playing out in emergency rooms, county jails, and on the main streets of my State. I can't tell you how many sheriffs have come to me pleading for help, telling me that the intake area of their jail looks like a detox center or an emergency room of a hospital. They are overwhelmed by these cases. We can and must do more to support access to treatment and to alert people of all ages to the risks of opioid abuse and heroin use. The 21st Century Cures Act will provide a vital infusion of $1 billion over 2 years to support grants to States to supplement treatment and prevention efforts. I was talking with one of my colleagues earlier today. Both of us remember when we were in school hearing lectures from recovering heroin addicts who came into the schools, and I can state that it was highly effective. We would never have tried heroin. I can't even think of a proper analogy. We know, unfortunately, that many of the people who are using heroin started with prescription opioids, and that is why I am encouraged by movements across our country and by actions taken, at my request and the request of other Senators, by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to make sure we are not putting pressure on providers to overprescribe opioids. Surely they are appropriate in certain cases, but the number of prescriptions has soared in this country and is twice the number prescribed on a per capita basis as in our neighboring country of Canada. The 21st Century Cures Act also includes a bill that I introduced with several of my colleagues--Senators Warren, Kirk, Baldwin, Alexander, and Murray--that is called the Advancing NIH Strategic Planning and Improving Representation in Medical Research Act. Despite its extremely cumbersome name, it is an important bill that has been incorporated into this legislation. It will require the NIH to release periodically a strategic plan outlining how the agency will meet its mission statement, and it will provide us with important guidance and metrics as we continue to work together to increase this vital funding. It will also help to ensure that study populations in clinical research are more representative of the diverse population in our country. For example, women face many of the same health threats as men, such as heart disease and cancer, but they react differently to various treatments. I remember years ago an infamous study that was called MRFIT. It had only men enrolled in it. I believe, if memory serves me correctly, it was to look at heart disease. Well, women often have different symptoms of heart disease than do men, and they respond differently to different medications, therapies, and treatments. We also know that women are at higher risk for certain chronic health conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease and osteoporosis. They suffer from those diseases in far greater numbers than do men. With Alzheimer's disease, I am wondering whether it is simply a matter that the biggest risk factor is age and women live longer than men, but perhaps there are other factors at play. My point is that by helping to ensure that women, African Americans, Latinos, and other demographic groups are appropriately represented in clinical research, we can increase our scientific understanding of the causes, risk factors, prevention strategies, and effects of treatments for diseases that commonly or disproportionately affect these populations. The bill before us also includes legislation that I introduced with my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Baldwin, to help address the educational debt burden that many young researchers face. This is so important to help ensure that America's finest, up-and-coming young researchers continue to help lead the world in biomedical discovery in this country. I don't want to lose these young talented people to other countries. I want them to stay right here. If they come to work for the NIH or the CDC or other federally funded institutions and agencies and we can get them help with their medical school, college, their advanced degrees, and their debt, that is a very good agreement for us to be making. It is also of tremendous importance that we were able to add mental health legislation to the 21st Century Cures Act. The reforms in this bill will enhance coordination, address a lack of resources, and develop real solutions to improve outcomes for individuals with serious mental illness and to help their families, who are often desperate to get them the help they need. I am pleased that the bill also includes the Mental Health on Campus Improvement Act, which I offered as an amendment when we considered the mental health legislation in committee. My colleague, Senator Dick Durbin, and I introduced this legislation for the first time in 2009. I commend him for his leadership. College students in Maine and across the country must have access to critical and often lifesaving mental health services. Despite growing demand for these critical services, far too many students still lack access. Without these services, students may experience detrimental effects that range from declining academic performance to drug dependence and to being at greater risk of suicide. While millions of Americans suffer from mental illness, only a statistical few engage in unspeakable acts of violence against themselves or others. Suicide, however, is the leading cause of death among Americans between the ages of 15 and 34. In addition, recent tragedies on college campuses, such as the shooting at a community college in Roseburg, OR, or at Northern Illinois University, highlight the dire need for mental health outreach and counseling services on college campuses. Perhaps some of the tragedies that we have witnessed might have been prevented had the resources been in place to support timely diagnosis, early intervention, and effective treatment for those struggling with severe mental illness. One of the saddest meetings I have had in the last year was with a group of families from Maine who had adult children who were suffering from severe mental illness, yet these families felt powerless in getting them the help they needed. These adult children were not compliant with the medication they had been prescribed, and in many cases their families felt powerless to be able to get them the help they needed. In one terrible case, a man's son was released from a hospital in the State of Maine--from a hospital for people with mental illness--and he killed his mother, thinking she was Al Qaeda. Only then could his father get his son the institutionalized help his son so desperately needed. It was just such a painful, painful story to hear from this anguished father and husband. I believe the language in this bill will help to change that. The 21st Century Cures Act passed the House last week by an overwhelming vote of 392 to 26. Think how few bills pass with that kind of strong, bipartisan support. It is supported by President Obama, who had an op-ed in Maine newspapers this weekend endorsing the bill. It is the product of years of bipartisan work on the Senate HELP Committee, and it has earned the support of more than 300 organizations. [[Page S6692]] Frankly, I am surprised that we are having a rollcall vote--a cloture vote on this bill. I am surprised because, while this bill may not be perfect--and no bill is--there is so much that is worthwhile, good, and significant in it that will make such a difference to so many American families. I urge all of our colleagues to vote in support of this bill so that we can quickly send it to the President's desk, where he is eager to sign it into law. It may well be the most important, far-reaching legislation that we pass this year in terms of its benefits for families across this great Nation. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Supporting Our Veterans Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of nearly 100,000 veterans who live in Montana. These are folks who have earned our deep respect and gratitude. I have traveled the State many times, listened to their ideas, and I have listened to their concerns. Montana's veterans have not been shy about expressing their views. What I have heard is this. There is no doubt that we must hold the VA accountable and work to improve access to health care, jobs, education, transportation, and housing for veterans. That is why it is critically important that we are taking marching orders from veterans and the advocacy organizations that are led by veterans, because we know that their top priority is to do right by the folks who they serve. Veterans in Montana also tell me that when it comes to solving the problems facing veterans, they expect folks in Washington, DC, to check their politics at the door and go to work. Unfortunately, there are groups out there that are funded by dark money. They hide their out-of-touch political agenda behind the veil of our Nation's veterans. As the incoming ranking member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I have serious concerns about who President-Elect Trump is listening to when it comes to honoring our veterans and this Nation's commitment to those who have worn the uniform. That is why it is so troubling that recent news reports have indicated that the Trump administration is relying heavily on guidance from Concerned Veterans for America. Concerned Veterans for America is a political advocacy group funded by the Koch brothers, who want to dump unlimited amounts of dark money to push dangerous policies that would privatize the VA or to convert the Veterans Health Administration into an independent, nongovernment- chartered, for-profit corporation. CVA also wants to divert funds from the VA and cripple its ability to plan for the long term to recruit doctors and nurses and to invest in the information technology that can improve veterans' experiences at the VA. These cuts will undermine the quality of care at the VA. There is nothing wrong with helping veterans get specialty care in the community in a timely fashion when the VA cannot do it. That often happens in rural communities, but CVA's push for wholesale dismantling of the VA is not what we want, and that is not what the veterans need. We need to talk to the veterans--the veterans I have spoken to--and this is what we will see. When folks volunteer to serve in the Armed Forces, this Nation is indebted to them. We must ensure that we deliver on those promises that are made. Privatizing the VA will fail our veterans and their families. It will reduce the quality of care that our veterans receive, and it will be more expensive for taxpayers. Privatizing the VA will ultimately mean that veterans will wait longer for doctors' appointments and the cost of care will go up. All we have to do is take a look at the Veterans Choice Program, which allows veterans to access care at private facilities. It has resulted in longer wait times, and this is unacceptable. Under this program, veterans are actually waiting longer to see doctors. Hospitals are increasingly frustrated and refusing to see veterans, and costs are going through the roof. Imagine this program on steroids. That is what the CVA wants to do--all while starving the VA's existing workforce and infrastructure. In fact, what CVA is pushing for is similar to what Speaker Ryan wants to do with Medicare, and we have seen the backlash to that proposal by seniors across this Nation. The same is true with the veterans and proposals to privatize the VA. It is simply bad policy. Groups such as the VFW, the American Legion, Disabled American Veterans, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, and many others oppose privatization, and they oppose it for good reason. The American Legion national commander, Dale Barnett, said it best: The private sector didn't send our heroes to war. Uncle Sam did. Barnett is right. The Federal Government has an obligation to honor those incredible sacrifices. When we shirk that responsibility, it dishonors those brave men and women. We need to listen to the American Legion and countless other veterans groups, whose mission is to help the veterans, not unravel the VA. Veterans service organizations are very different and have a very different mission and tax structure than Concerned Veterans for America, the first being that VSOs take their cues from the veterans they represent, not from billionaire political activists who fund their operation. Groups such as the Legion, the VFW, and Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America are organized as nonprofit groups whose missions are simply to help veterans. Concerned Veterans for America is an issue advocacy group with a political mission. VSOs disclose their donors. CVA doesn't have to. Yet CVA has incredible influence and the ear of the President-elect. This is deeply concerning to me and, more importantly, it is deeply concerning to the veterans across this Nation. I talk to veterans every week when I am home in Montana. They universally tell me that they like the care they receive from the VA once they get in the door; the problem is getting in the door. They don't want to see a private doc; they want to be seen by a VA doc. They know that the VA understands their unique issues. They know that doctors and nurses at the VA are attentive to the wounds of war. My hope is that President-elect Donald Trump starts talking with the folks who want to help veterans and not to organizations with a political agenda. My hope is that he will work with Chairman Isakson and me and countless other reputable veterans groups to hold the VA accountable while increasing access to care. My hope is that he will work with Democrats, Republicans, and Independents to reform our campaign finance laws so that we can increase transparency and know who is trying to influence this government. My hope is that he will put veterans first as he chooses the next VA Secretary. I remain hopeful that we can find common ground to work together to hold the VA accountable, to improve care, and to ensure that we are all delivering for veterans. When our brothers and sisters and sons and daughters are sent to war, we make promises to them--promises we must keep. When they come home, they are changed people, and we cannot expect the private sector to address these seen and unseen wounds of war. In this upcoming Congress, there will be incredible opportunities to make progress, and I am fully committed to Montana's veterans and veterans across this country and their families, and I will push back against those who attempt to undermine the noble mission of the Veterans' Administration. Mr. President, I yield the floor. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to support the 21st Century Cures Act, which would make vital investments in research to develop new treatments for deadly diseases, including cancer. The bill would also dedicate desperately needed funding to address some of our country's most pressing public health problems--opioid addiction and mental illness. First, I would like to speak about the bill's provisions for cancer and rare diseases. Cancer touches the lives of all Americans; it doesn't discriminate. We [[Page S6693]] have all experienced the grief and pain that comes with losing a loved one, friend, or colleague to this terrible disease. Cancer is the second leading cause of death in our country. Nearly 40 percent of Americans will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lives, according to the National Cancer Institute. We have made great strides in improving detection, treatment, and survival rates for many cancers, including early-stage breast cancer, prostate cancer, and melanoma. Despite this progress, other cancers like pancreatic and certain brain cancers remain extremely deadly, with very low 5-year survival rates. These cancers are typically detected in late stages, and even the most cutting-edge treatments may result in just a few more months of life. The Cures Act designates nearly $4.8 billion in additional funds for medical research through the National Institutes of Health, $1.8 billion of which will expand and accelerate cancer research, in line with Vice President Biden's Cancer Moonshot Initiative. This research funding also supports important initiatives focused on precision medicine and neurological research. Next, I would like to talk about the bill's funding to combat opioid addiction, which is an epidemic in this country. Nearly 2 million Americans are addicted to opioids, and 19,000 Americans overdosed and died in 2014. This epidemic stems from a surge in the use of prescription drugs. It is not a coincidence that prescription overdose deaths quadrupled during the same period that opioid prescriptions quadrupled. In 2012, 259 million prescriptions for opioids were written. That means 80 percent of Americans could have a bottle of pills. Prescription drug abuse frequently leads to heroin addiction because these drugs affect the brain in the same way. This problem is exacerbated because heroin is significantly cheaper that prescription opioids like OxyContin or fentanyl. This crisis demands an immediate, comprehensive, national response. Congress took a first step earlier this year, passing the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act in May. This bill authorizes grants to expand access to substance use disorder treatment, strengthen prescription drug monitoring programs, and supply first responders with naloxone, which can reverse the effects of an overdose. However, this bill didn't include any funding for the initiatives it authorized. The Cures Act takes that step, providing $1 billion for the Department of Health and Human Services to fund many of the prevention and treatment programs authorized by Congress earlier this year. Lastly, I would like to highlight the bill's provisions to improve our country's mental health system. This is an area where we fall far short. We don't do nearly enough to ensure those with mental illness are able to access appropriate treatment and this has ripple effects throughout society. In October, I was briefed on the homelessness crisis in Los Angeles and toured a shelter for homeless women. A significant percentage of the city's homeless population is battling mental illness. So, by improving our mental health system, we are also going to address connected issues like homelessness. Under the bill, Health and Human Services will develop a strategic plan to address mental health priorities. There is increased funding to train our doctors and nurses to better integrate substance abuse and mental health treatment into primary care visits. The bill also reauthorizes many important existing programs, including the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and the National Child Traumatic Stress Network, and increases support for mental health and drug courts. These innovative approaches to criminal justice provide an alternative process for individuals to receive and comply with needed treatment and are supported by the law enforcement community. The bill further provides for police training when police officers encounter individuals who exhibit mental illness. I recently convened meetings in Los Angeles and San Francisco with law enforcement and community leaders, and they all stressed the importance of deescalating situations with mentally ill individuals to make sure that situations do not end with violent encounters. In closing, I reiterate my support for the 21 Century Cures Act and urge its swift passage. This is a great opportunity to spur this century's medical innovation, improve access to needed treatments, and strengthen public health. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from Tennessee. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Kirk be recognized next and then Senator Murphy following him and that after that, I be recognized. We will be voting at 5:30. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Illinois. Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, 4 years ago I climbed the Capitol steps for those who could not. I vowed to return to the Senate to create and establish a standard of care for rehabilitation in this legislation to make sure many people can have access to the best rehab, as I did. With the passage of the Cures Act tomorrow, we will achieve this lofty goal. The Cures Act also contains bipartisan provisions to provide accelerated approval of regenerative medicines and therapies. The Regrow Act, which is also in this bill, is a major step forward so that Americans will not have to go to other countries for their own stem cells to be used in their own therapy. Making sure this faster approval process happens in this bill means that many more people will be able to receive advanced stem cell therapies that are also available overseas, right here at home. I would like to thank everybody. We have made progress with the FDA. I championed with Senators Collins and Manchin on this. I thank my senior colleague from Tennessee for all of his action on the Regrow Act so we can make the fundamental point of using your own stem cells to accelerate healing. In the case of using your own stem cells, they already have your exact DNA match. I think it is wise that we go through a shorter process. I thank the Senator for putting the Kirk language in the Regrow Act. I yield the floor. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, while we are waiting for Senator Murphy, let me salute Senator Kirk for his leadership from the very beginning. He has pointed out to the committee and the Senate that, as the Mayo Clinic has said, regenerative medicine is a game changer for stroke victims, for heart disease, and for people with retinal disease. Thanks to Senator Kirk, Senator Collins, Senator Manchin, and Senator McConnell, we have legislation that takes an important and responsible step forward to recognize the promise of regenerative medicine. This bill includes $30 million to the National Institutes of Health for clinical trials to support regenerative medicine. Then there are two other provisions in the bill. One of them allows the Food and Drug Administration to make regenerative therapeutic products eligible for the FDA's existing accelerated drug approval pathway. We have had great success over the last 4 or 5 years with an accelerated pathway for drugs, similar to what Senators Burr and Bennet and others got enacted into law. We are doing the same thing with combination drugs and devices in this legislation. Now Senator Kirk has added regenerative medicine to the accelerated pathway, and I salute him for that leadership. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois. Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I wish to remind my colleague, who is also the chairman of the Appropriations Energy Subcommittee that controls the exascale funding, one of the most complicated things we can face in our world is biological systems when we look at the new Aurora computer that is going to be built in the Argonne National Laboratories. I know that at Oak Ridge, we have exascale computers. My goal is to make sure we are always way ahead of the Chinese. In the case of Aurora, we now have $165 million to make sure that we have a computer that is far faster than the computer in China. With that, we will be able to model proteins themselves to make sure we make these advances much faster. My hope is that we will be [[Page S6694]] stunned at how much biological work is being done at the Oak Ridge lab with their leading computer to make sure we accelerate progress on this. Let me say one thing about the work of the Senator. Every piece of legislation that he touches goes through by a couple hundred votes. When we see Lamar take over a bill, we know it is going to be going through on a big walloping. He got a huge vote in the Senate, and I hope he gets a big vote again. Everything he touches turns to gold, and we cannot have a better friend in medical care than we have in Lamar Alexander. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois is very generous, and I thank him, but I would remind him that he was the persistent agent for the change in support for regenerative medicine. That wasn't easy to do, and he has been the leader, along with others of us who cared about the same thing, in making sure the United States maintains its lead in supercomputing competition around the world. Senator Murphy, the Senator from Connecticut, is coming. I think what I will do is begin, and when he comes I will stop and let him make his 5 minutes of remarks and then resume so I don't delay the vote because I know everyone is looking forward to casting a great big ``yes'' vote in a few minutes. The U.S. Senate majority leader, whose position in the Senate this is, has said more than once in private meetings I attended and on the floor of this body that the 21st Century Cures bill on which we will be voting in a few minutes is the most important legislation Congress will pass this year. In his address to the Nation this past weekend, President Obama urged us to vote for the bill today and tomorrow. ``It could help us find a cure for Alzheimer's,'' the President said. ``It could end cancer as we know it and help those seeking treatment for opioid addiction.'' The President continued: ``It's an opportunity to save lives and an opportunity we just can't miss.'' Vice President Biden has been telephoning Senators urging support for 21st Century Cures because, in the Vice President's words, it is a big step for cancer research and the Cancer Moonshot that is so close to his heart. Speaker Paul Ryan in the House of Representatives has made 21st Century Cures explicitly a centerpiece of his vision for our country's future, describing it as ``bipartisan legislation that would accelerate the discovery, development, and delivery of lifesaving treatments.'' With such bipartisan support from the President of the United States, the Vice President of the United States, the Speaker of the House, the Senate majority leader--two Democrats, two Republicans--it is no wonder that on last Wednesday, the House of Representatives approved 21st Century Cures by the overwhelming vote of 392 to 26. This legislation holds the promise of improving the life and health of virtually every family in the country. It will provide $4.8 billion in a one-time surge of funding for biomedical research in a time of breathtaking opportunity. It will advance Vice President Biden's Cancer Moonshot to find cures for cancer and President Obama's Precision Medicine Initiative, as well as the BRAIN Initiative. It will help move safe and effective treatments and cures through the development and regulatory process more rapidly, and it will lower costs, making medicines available sooner and hopefully also at lower costs to patients. It will provide $1 billion in grants to help deal with the raging opioid epidemic. It includes legislation to help the one in five adults in this country suffering from a mental illness, help them receive treatment by updating many of our country's mental health programs for the first time in a decade. It will improve health information technology for doctors who are eager to get rid of the overdocumentation of hospitals and their patients and help get the Nation's electronic health records system out of the ditch. From a taxpayer's point of view, it does all of these things in a fiscally responsible way by reducing other spending to pay for every penny of the $6.3 billion cost. I see the Senator from Connecticut on the floor, so I would like to suspend my remarks for 5 minutes so that he can make his, and then I would ask unanimous consent that the totality of my remarks follow his remarks. Before he speaks, let me just say once again how much I appreciate his leadership and that of Senator Cassidy and Senator Cornyn. One reason the majority leader calls this the most important piece of legislation Congress will act on this year is because it includes the mental health legislation that these Senators, including Senator Murphy, Senator Cornyn, and Senator Cassidy, have offered. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut. Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Alexander's kindness in allowing me to say a few words in support of this bill on behalf of myself and Senator Murray. I wish to congratulate Senator Alexander for once again showing how the Senate can work properly, how we can bring together Republicans and Democrats for a priority that really has nothing to do with whether one is a Republican or a Democrat or whether one voted for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. If people are out there suffering from a life-altering or potentially terminal disease or suffering from mental illness or addiction, they need help, and we are coming together in maybe one of the most important pieces of health legislation that has passed this Congress in a very long time to deliver that help. So I am not going to endeavor to recreate the remarks of Senator Alexander when it comes to describing the important aspects of this bill except to say that after passage of this bill, it is going to be a whole heck of a lot more likely that a life-changing, lifesaving drug is going to be able to make it to market in time to save a life. Every single one of the underlying reforms in this bill to the drug discovery process is bipartisan. I think about Senators Bennet and Hatch's bill, the promise for antibiotics and therapeutics for health, which establishes a new pathway for antibacterial and antifungal drugs that will treat serious, life-threatening infections for patients. I think about Senator Casey and Senator Isakson working on the Advancing Hope Act, which will extend the pediatric priority review voucher program until 2020. It incentivizes drug companies to research treatment for life-altering diseases that impact pediatric patients. Inside this bill are all sorts of good, important, bipartisan achievements. As Senator Alexander noted, there is also help on the way for people suffering from addiction. In my tiny little State--only 1 percent of the Nation's population--we are going to have over 800 people die this year from drug overdoses. Yes, we need to get to the source of that epidemic and stop people from getting addicted to pain medications in the first place, but, boy, we have an awful lot of people showing up with overdoses in our emergency rooms who have no place to go, have no detox programs, no long-term residential programs. The $1 billion authorized in this legislation to fight the opioid epidemic is going to save lives in my little State. Finally, when it comes to the issue of mental health--Senator Alexander, Senator Cassidy, and I were on the floor last week talking about this legislation; the focus on funding prevention, the focus on making sure parents are part of the care for their adult children, the focus on ensuring that insurance companies really do pay attention to the Parity Act we passed 10 years ago in this Congress to assure that you get covered for mental illness just like physical illness. A broken leg really isn't any different than a broken brain when we think about it. We can treat both. These are important advances in mental health as well. I know this place has a bad reputation; that people pay attention to the fights here more often than they do to the moments where we get together and cooperate. The 21st Century Cures Act that Senator Murray and Senator Alexander, with help from Senator Cornyn, me, Senator Cassidy, and in the House Congressmen Upton, Pallone, Tim Murphy, and Eddie Bernice Johnson--this is an example of how this place can work better. As we head in to what may be a very charged atmosphere in January, I hope we remember this moment. I wanted to [[Page S6695]] come down on behalf of Senator Murray, who has helped shepherd this process, to congratulate Senator Alexander on it and recommend its passage to all of my colleagues. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his words, support, and his leadership this year. I thank also Senator Murray from Washington. She would be here, except her plane is delayed. The vote will be held open to make sure she can be here, but Senator Murray is a Member of the Democratic leadership and well respected on that side of the aisle but also on this side of the aisle because, when she can, she creates an environment where we can do today exactly what we are doing today. I think the American people appreciate that, and Senator Murphy and I both benefit from that. I thank the Senator for those remarks and will now continue my remarks. At a Senate hearing earlier this year, Dr. Francis Collins, the distinguished head of the National Institutes of Health--an agency he calls the ``National Institutes of Hope''--offered ``bold predictions'' about major advances to expect in the next 10 years from sustained investments in biomedical research, such as we are doing with this bill. One prediction is that scientists will find ways to identify individuals at risk for Alzheimer's even before symptoms appear, as well as how to slow or even prevent the disease. Today, Alzheimer's causes untold family grief and costs $236 billion a year. Left unchecked, the cost in 2050 would be more than our Nation spends on national defense. Dr. Collins' other predictions are equally breathtaking. Using stem cells, doctors could use a patient's own cells to rebuild his or her heart. This personalized rebuilt heart, Dr. Collins says, would make transplant waiting lists and anti-rejection drugs obsolete. He expects development of an artificial pancreas to help diabetes patients by tracking blood glucose levels and creating precise doses of insulin. He says a Zika vaccine should be widely available by 2018, with universal flu vaccine and HIV/AIDS vaccine available within the decade. To relieve suffering and deal with the epidemic of opioid addiction that led to 28,000 overdose deaths in America in 2014, he predicts new nonaddictive medicines to manage pain, an even more effective antidote than the $1 billion we would be authorizing by our votes today. These truly would be miracles. The bill has taken more than 2 years to assemble both in the Senate and the House. There have been major differences of opinion, but the resolution of those differences--thanks to Senator Murray and many other Senators--has been bipartisan every step of the way. We saw that on display in the work of the President, the Vice President, the Speaker of the House, and the Senate majority leader. We saw it in the House with its vote of 392 to 26 last week, thanks especially to the leadership of Chairman Upton, Ranking Member Pallone, and Representative DeGette. We saw it in our Senate Health Committee, where we approved 19 bills that include 50 proposals, and every one with both a Democratic and Republican sponsor, except for 1 bill offered solely by Senator Murray, who is the ranking Democratic member of our committee. We have a diverse committee of 22 Members--that would be an understatement, actually--some of the most liberal Members and some of the most conservative Members, but when our committee considered these 19 bills during our 3 markups held over several months, the largest number of votes against any one of these 19 bipartisan bills was 2. Let me say that again. The largest number of votes--recorded votes--against any one of these 19 bipartisan bills was 2 in our committee of 22. Here is what some of those 19 bipartisan bills--again, approved unanimously or by a wide margin--would do to help move safe and effective treatments and cures more rapidly through the regulatory process and into patients' medicine cabinets and into doctors' offices. For example, Senators Bennet, Warren, Burr, and Hatch's act would allow researchers to use their own data from previously approved therapies when they submit for review a treatment or cure for serious rare genetic diseases, like Duchenne's, a rare kind of muscular dystrophy that could impact children as young as 3. Senators Burr and Franken's legislation will help to bring innovative medical devices--such as artificial knees, insulin pumps, and heart stents--to patients more quickly by getting rid of unnecessary burdens in medical device evaluations and streamlining the review process for clinical trials. Senators Baldwin and Collins have a bill to improve opportunities for our young researchers, essential to advancing biomedical research. Senator Kirk just talked about his legislation with Bennet, Hatch, Murkowski, Isakson, and Collins to improve rehabilitation research and help the approximately 800,000 Americans who suffer a stroke each year. Senators Isakson, Murphy, Casey, Wicker, and Vitter will help advance our understanding of neurological diseases. Senator Murray, as I mentioned earlier, will clarify that the FDA requires cleaning and validation data for reusable medical devices. Senators Murray, Hatch, Bennet, Cassidy and Whitehouse's bill will improve health information technology for doctors and their patients. We had six hearings on medical information technology programs in a ditch. We think we are helping to get them out of the ditch. We have been working with the Obama administration to do that, and I look forward to working with the Trump administration to continue that. Senators Burr, Bennet, Hatch, and Donnelly would speed safe breakthrough devices, putting senior people in charge of the review process. Casey, Isakson, Brown, and Kirk's legislation. If you are the parent of a child with a rare disease like brain cancer, their bill would increase the likelihood that your child will be able to take a drug that will help by giving a drug company that develops a drug for such a disease a voucher they could keep or sell that would speed up the review of another drug. One may say this is getting boring. This is too long. It is not boring to the millions of Americans who stand to benefit from this, and it is exactly the kind of work we ought to be doing in the United States Senate and what the American people would like to see us do more of. The Medical Electronic Data Technology Enhancement Act, with Senators Bennet and Hatch and many others interested in that. Senators Burr and Casey and Isakson and Roberts have important legislation for planning ahead for events like bioterror attacks, to help protect against anthrax, for example, or smallpox. The Combination Products Innovation Act, with a number of Senators involved on the committee, will help prevent the growing field of combination products--like bandaids with Neosporin built in or a heart stent that can be implanted to deliver blood thinners to prevent clots--from being caught in redtape. Then there is legislation that will give patients and their families a voice in drug development. There is one that is a top priority for the heads of FDA and NIH which will help those agencies attract and keep the kind of talent they need to approve all these exciting advances that are coming. There is legislation to shorten the development of new treatments to help those affected with life-threatening superbugs. The Advancing Precision Medicine Act, which Senator Murray and I cosponsored, is in direct support of President Obama's initiative to map 1 million genomes so researchers can develop treatments and cures tailored to a patient's genome. There are five or six other major pieces of legislation that I will include in the Record but not read at this time because we are approaching the time for a vote, but let me conclude by saying that in addition to these bipartisan policies, the 21st Century Cures bill includes $6.3 billion in funding. We usually don't attach such funding to a bill authorizing programs. We usually work [[Page S6696]] along two tracks; one track for authorizing programs and one deciding how much to spend on those programs. During the last 2 years, while we have been working on our authorizing legislation, our appropriations committees have recommended major increases in support for biomedical research, and it is important that every Senator know this. In the current year, at the urging of Senators Blunt and Senator Murray, Congress added $2 billion a year to the $32 billion budget of the National Institutes of Health, which could total $20 billion over 10 years. Then, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended another $2 billion increase for the next fiscal year, 2017, which could total another $20 billion over 10 years. This 21st Century Cures legislation adds $4.8 billion in a surge of one-time spending for the National Institutes of Health on top of the regular appropriated money toward key objectives: $1.8 billion for the Cancer Moonshot, $1.4 billion for precision medicine, $1.6 for the BRAIN Initiative, and it adds $1 billion for State grants to help States fight the opioid abuse epidemic. I believe that for every State represented by a Senator here tonight, the opioid epidemic is on the front pages of the newspapers. It adds $500 million for the Food and Drug Administration, and 21st Century Cures also gives the National Institutes of Health $30 million for clinical trials to support regenerative medicine, which the Mayo Clinic has described as a ``game- changing area of medicine with the potential to fully heal damaged tissues and organs, offering solutions and hope for people who have conditions that are beyond repair.'' It gives the FDA authority to allow regenerative therapeutic products to be eligible for FDA's existing accelerated drug approval pathway. I wish to acknowledge the work of Speaker Ryan and Leader McConnell in designing a way to secure funding that both Democrats and Republicans can accept. That is not always easy. For those concerned about additional spending--often on our side of the aisle--Speaker Ryan and House Budget Chairman Tom Price made sure the funding is one time, not mandatory, paid for, and approved each year by Appropriations Committees. It doesn't add one penny to the overall budget because for every increase in the discretionary budget, we reduce the same amount in the mandatory ledger. For those who worry that Congress might not approve the $6.3 billion in additional spending in later years--I have heard a little of that from the other side of the aisle--my answer is that the best way to ensure the money is spent in the following years is a big vote today and tomorrow when we finally pass the bill, just as the House did last week. In conclusion, it will be hard to explain why you voted to spend $6.3 billion for cancer, the Precision Medicine Initiative, and opioids this year but then voted not to spend it next year, and the legislation provides that the money cannot be diverted for any other purpose than what we vote for today and tomorrow. In addition, this year's portion of Cures funding--including one-half billion for opioid grants--is included in the continuing resolution that we will vote on later this week. This is the kind of lasting legacy the President of the United States and our Congress can be proud of. The next administration or the next Congress will not be repealing this law because we have taken the time to work out our differences and create a consensus of support. We did this at this time last year with an equally complicated bill to fix No Child Left Behind, which, despite its complexities, received 85 votes in this body. When he signed it, the President called it a ``Christmas miracle.'' The 21st Century Cures bill will present President Obama with another Christmas miracle, one that will help virtually every family. When we pass this legislation, the real winners will be the American families whose lives will be improved by this bipartisan legislation. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, with the permission of my distinguished chairman, who has worked very hard on this bill and whose efforts I appreciate very much, I wanted to add, very briefly, that I hope very much and look forward to working with my colleagues to assure that the second tranche of the opioid funding is aligned with the CARA bill, or the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, which we just passed in such bipartisan fashion a few months ago. We have not achieved that alignment yet, and I hope that we do very soon. I appreciate the terrific efforts of my chairman. With that, I yield. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah. Remembering James Tancill Lyons Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Jim Lyons, a longtime staffer on Capitol Hill--my staffer--and a fixture in tax policy here in DC, who passed away on September 29 of this year. James Tancill Lyons was born on March 7, 1973, to Stephen and Ann Lyons, both natives of the DC-Virginia area with longstanding ties to the local community. Growing up in Springfield, VA, Jim was an accomplished athlete, excelling in both baseball and basketball. Oddly, for a sports fan in the DC area, his favorite football team was the Dallas Cowboys--a decision he made consciously because his older brother, Stephen, was a big Redskins fan. Jim was also a great student, eventually graduating summa cum laude from James Madison University. He went to law school at the University of Texas, where he made the Editing Committee of the Texas Journal of Business Law and won a scholarship for being the best tax law student in his class after pulling the top grade in his business associations, income tax, international tax, corporate tax, and estate and gift tax classes. After law school, he earned a clerkship at the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and then got a job working for Cleary Gottlieb, one of the finest law firms in the country. Of course, you would never guess any of this if you knew Jim. While he was always an incredibly valuable and often brilliant attorney and congressional staffer, he talked about his college and law school days as though he spent most of his time having fun and just barely skating by. That, of course, was vintage Jim Lyons--incredibly outgoing but unbelievably humble. Jim could have a long conversation with anyone about pretty much anything, but he was never one to spend all that much time touting his own accomplishments. Make no mistake, Jim Lyons was very accomplished. After his time at the law firm in New York, Jim made his way to the House Ways and Means Committee, and, following a brief subsequent and successful stint at the Department of Justice, he was hired by Chairman Chuck Grassley to serve as tax counsel on the Senate Finance Committee. In his 8 years on the Finance Committee, he made a mark on every major tax bill, not to mention a number of debt and budget deals that went through the Senate, including many tax-extenders bills, some of which he seemed to be able to cobble together singlehandedly. [[Page S6687]] Jim was smart as a whip. He was a tremendously valuable congressional staffer because he had both a remarkable understanding of tax policy and an uncanny ability to see all the traps and pitfalls that stood ahead for any particular proposal or piece of legislation. He had an encyclopedic knowledge of the technical aspects of the Tax Code, as well as a clear understanding of the real-world implications, immediately seeing where a particular tax policy or bill would fit in the larger policy and, when necessary, the political landscape. Jim was one of those people who could go into the weeds to discuss, debate, and negotiate tax policy literally with anyone on the planet but also break that same policy down to its essential elements and explain it to lesser mortals, including, I have to say, more than a few of us U.S. Senators. Of course, like all of us, Jim had his own ideological views and opinions, and he made no secret about the way he saw the world and his beliefs about the best path forward for our country. When necessary, he was a fierce advocate for his own views, but more importantly, for someone in his position, he was able, when necessary, to dispassionately apply his accrued knowledge and expertise to any tax proposal, whether it came from a conservative or liberal or a Republican or Democrat, and then break it down to its essence and give a clear and concise assessment of the policy and its chances for being enacted. All of this made him an essential and indispensable part of our efforts on the Senate Finance Committee for close to a decade. As I think all of my colleagues will attest, staffers with that kind of knowledge and ability to evaluate policy and lay out its chances for success really can be hard to come by. However, in the weeks since Jim's passing, it hasn't been his accomplishments or his knowledge of the Tax Code that people have most remembered; instead, most of the focus has been on his friendly demeanor, his mischievous sense of humor, and most of all, his kind heart. Dozens of Jimmy's friends and colleagues visited Jim and his family in the hospital during his final days, and during the October recess, hundreds attended a memorial service held here in the Capitol. Each one of these people had at least one personal story to share about Jim. Sure, some of the stories did touch on his successes as a staffer and his professional disposition, but far more often the stories were about Jim's kindness, even to strangers, or his ability to make people feel at ease--and sometimes laugh uncontrollably--even in tense situations. Jim was always quick to offer assistance and comfort to those in need and to provide a much needed laugh when things got really tough. He is one of very few people I have come across on Capitol Hill--and keep in mind I have been here a while--who will be remembered more or less equally for the bills he successfully drafted and negotiated and for the way he cracked everyone up at the negotiating table. I think my favorite story I have heard about Jim came from his mother Ann. In 2003, Jim was living in New York City when much of that part of the country suffered a massive blackout. It is difficult to be in a place like New York without power, and Jim noticed many people on his way home who were stranded and in need of assistance. Rather than look down at the ground and head quickly for home, as many would probably want to do in that situation, Jim offered help to a dozen or so people, bringing them all home to his apartment, giving them both food and a comfortable space to ride out the power outage. Most of these people were strangers. Yet Jim, ever the kind soul, offered his time and his home to help them through a difficult evening. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of pages 14 and 15 from the August 2003 edition of Cleargolaw News, a newsletter for the law firm where Jim worked at that time, be printed in the Record following my remarks. The article tells the story of Jim's efforts during the power blackout. These are the types of stories that have constantly been shared since Jim's passing, and I know these memories and stories from people who knew and worked with Jim have been helpful to his family during this difficult time. When I hear these accounts of people's interactions with Jim, I am reminded of a popular hymn in my church, which reads: Each life that touches ours for good Reflects thine own great mercy, Lord; Thou sendest blessings from above Thru words and deeds of those who love. What greater gift dost thou bestow, What greater goodness can we know Than Christ-like friends, whose gentle ways Strengthen our faith, enrich our days. When such a friend from us departs, We hold forever in our hearts A sweet and hallowed memory, Bringing us nearer, Lord, to thee. Jim Lyons led a life which touched many others for the better. His positive influence has been felt by countless people, pretty much anyone who had the opportunity to interact with him. I personally already miss Jim's stalwart presence on the Finance Committee. I miss his wise and plain-spoken advice and unequalled knowledge of tax policy. More than that, I miss the kind and humorous manner that endeared Jim to so many of us working in and around the Senate. There is a simple quote--an anonymous proverb of sorts--that has often been attributed to Dr. Seuss, though its origin is ultimately in dispute: ``Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened.'' Over the past couple of months, I think that has been the prevailing sentiment among those of us who were lucky enough to know Jim Lyons. While tears have been shed and great sadness has been felt, the remembrances we have had of Jim's life and our interactions with him have given all of us reason to smile and even laugh. I want to once again express my condolences to Jim's family, his parents Stephen and Ann, his brother Steve, his two nephews, Tyler and Blake, and of course his beloved dog Buddy. Recently, I have had the opportunity to spend time with and get to know Jim's wonderful family. They are truly extraordinary people, and my prayers continue to go out to them. I know I am not alone in that regard. I care for them. Everybody who knew Jim and has now known them cares for them. Our sympathy and our heartfelt thanks go out to them for allowing their son to become the great person he became, and, of course, allowing him to come and work with us on Capitol Hill. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Thank You for Taking Care of Us (By Alice Steinert) Here is a wonderfully refreshing story about a truly good, kind person. The day of the blackout was scary for some, devastating for others, and just plain inconvenient for many. There are those of us who still have thighs and calves that ache from all those flights of stairs! Many people could not get home that night for a number of reasons--1) after walking down that many flights of stairs, some people were a bit lame and therefore could not walk the distance to their homes, or their homes were too far to walk to; 2) there were few, if any, buses, taxi cabs, cars, trains, ferries, no subways, and no hotel vacancies; 3) etc., etc., etc. But, for those of us fortunate enough to know Jim Lyons, CGSH Associate extraordinaire, we certainly know the meaning of the true human spirit. Jim invited many people to his home that day when we had to evacuate OLP. He provided an immediate ``base'' for people to relax, calm down, regroup, make contact with family/friends, eat, drink, whatever they needed. But, for nine of us (Ron Becton, Robert Franklin, Monica Gagnon, Glenville Hunter, Amy Menendez, Alice Steinert, Jason Steinert, Naj-Lah Toussaint and Carol Whatley), he provided much, much more. He provided a safe haven for the night. At about 7:45 P.M. Jim walked from his home to OLP to see if there was anyone else in need of assistance. Well, he found nine of us who were seriously thinking about bunking down for the night in front of the lobby doors. Without hesitation Jim invited all of us to his home (he had never even met some of us before). Not only did he provide us with a roof over our heads, he also offered food and beverage, the use of his cell phone, pillows and blankets, and even gave up his bed to two of us ladies. Not only that, he bought toothbrushes for us; What ensued was a night we will all remember--good people, stimulating conversation, a lot of fun, and a great deal of bonding and comeraderie. While we will individually, and as a group, thank Jim, I think everyone in the firm should recognize what an exceptional person Jim is. If there were more ``Jim's'' in the world, what a different place it would be. God Bless You Jim. Remembering King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today, December 5, 2016, in commemoration of the 89th birthday of the late [[Page S6688]] King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand and in recognition of the National Day of Thailand. In remembrance of the extraordinary life, steady leadership, and remarkable 70-year reign of the beloved King Bhumibol, I have introduced S. Con. Res. 57, along with Representative Matt Salmon in the House. This resolution honors the late King's lasting legacy, extends our collective condolences to the royal family and the people of Thailand, and celebrates the alliance and friendship between our two nations. I would like to thank the cosponsors of this resolution, Senators Whitehouse, Roberts, Markey, Flake, Cotton, and Gardner. Additionally, I express my appreciation to Chairman Bob Corker for his assistance in receiving timely consideration of this bipartisan effort in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. His Majesty, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, enjoyed a special relationship with the United States, having been born in Cambridge, MA, in 1927, while his father was completing his medical studies at Harvard University. He was always a trusted friend of the United States in advancing a strong and enduring alliance and partnership between our two countries. At the time of his death on October 13, 2016, King Bhumibol Adulyadej was the longest serving head of state in the world and the longest serving in the history of Thailand. He dedicated his life to the well- being of the Thai people and the sustainable development of his country. His Majesty was an anchor of peace and stability for Thailand and for the region, earning him the deep reverence of the Thai people and the respect of leaders around the world. I hope my colleagues will join me tomorrow in passing S. Con. Res. 57 as a gesture of respect and appreciation for the life of this great leader and as a symbol of our continued commitment to and friendship with Thailand. Additionally, I am sure my colleagues in the Senate will join me in offering our warmest congratulations and best wishes to the new King of Thailand, His Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Passage Vitiated--H.R. 5602, S. 3336, and Calendar Nos. 675 through 683 Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to vitiate passage of H.R. 5602, S. 3336, and Calendar Nos. 675 through 683. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Farewell to the Senate Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the Senate floor for the last time. I am not generally big on nostalgic reminiscences, but I would like to briefly reflect on what is clearly the greatest honor of my professional life--my 12 years in the U.S. Senate and 5\1/ 2\ years in the U.S. House of Representatives and the enormous honor of serving the people of Louisiana to whom I will always be so deeply indebted. In some ways it seems like just yesterday that I was on the floor of the U.S. House being sworn in, surrounded by our very young children, except for Jack, who wasn't born yet. I said then: ``I am honored, humbled, awestruck to stand before you today.'' I stated my simple goal: to become at ease and comfortable as I learn the ways of Congress, as I hopefully become an effective representative and respected colleague and friend, but never to become so at ease and comfortable that I lose these feelings of honor, of humility, of awe, and, believe me, I haven't. My very first year in the Senate was a very memorable one. That year Louisiana was struck by Hurricanes Rita and Katrina. After the initial shock of those cataclysmic events, I realized that for quite some time, my priorities as Louisiana Senator would be dominated by the desperate need to rebuild our State, including dramatically improving our hurricane and flood protection and restoring our coastline. Katrina's devastation was hard to imagine, destroying much of Southeast Louisiana and Coastal Mississippi. Less than 1 month later, Hurricane Rita slammed into Southwest Louisiana as another one of the most intense hurricanes in history. I immediately went to work with Senator Landrieu and the rest of our Louisiana delegation as well as my good friends Thad Cochran, Trent Lott, and others to secure the necessary disaster recovery assistance and also to make reforms to the Army Corps of Engineers to better protect our families and communities from future natural disasters. Louisiana has continued to face and survive other major disasters, including Hurricane Gustav in August and September 2008, Hurricane Ike in September of that same year, Hurricane Isaac in 2012, the Red River flooding in Northern and Central Louisiana, and the 1,000-year-flood event in greater Baton Rouge and Acadiana this past August. As if all of that weren't enough, in April of 2010, the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded off the coast of Louisiana, killing 11 men and devastating our coastline. The disaster, followed by the horribly misguided offshore drilling moratorium President Obama put in place, caused economic and environmental chaos in Louisiana. Once again, I immediately went to work with so many others to increase and improve safety measures and reopen the Gulf of Mexico to energy exploration and put people back to work. We introduced legislation to dedicate a majority of the BP penalties toward restoring coastal ecosystems and economies damaged by the spill. It was an uphill battle to ensure Louisiana was fairly compensated, but we did, and we achieved substantial wins, including passage of that critical RESTORE Act that I described. During the recovery fight following each of these disasters, I found that the most effective leadership involved communicating clearly and employing solutions based on Louisiana common sense, and what always inspired me and kept me going was the unbelievable resilience, faith, and determination of my fellow Louisianans. Their strength and optimism have been oh so powerful reminders of how blessed I have been to serve them. On a host of other important issues, I always sought to further two sets of political values, really modeled after my two favorite Presidents, Ronald Reagan and Teddy Roosevelt. I always strove to further the central American tradition of limited government and individual freedom, and I was never afraid to shake things up, to demand needed reforms to ensure that leaders in Washington served the American people and not the other way around. I have had the honor of protecting Louisiana's traditions and proud heritage while here in the Senate. Louisianans love the outdoors and want strong environmental conservation and sportsmen's policies to maintain that culture, and that certainly includes securing the rights afforded to each American by the Second Amendment, which I have fought to do. Louisianans respect the sanctity of life, which has been one of my top priorities while serving in Congress. I have introduced many bills that end taxpayer funding of abortion and abortion mills and have proudly stood in the defense of life. When it comes to our Nation's immigration policies, I have been an advocate for targeted reforms that fix the immigration crisis, starting with border security and enforcing the immigration laws already on the books. I fought President Obama's unconstitutional attempts to implement Executive amnesty, which only encourages more immigrants to come here illegally and insults the millions of fine immigrants who do follow U.S. law. I was also the first to introduce legislation in 2007 to end dangerous sanctuary city policies and have continued to do so each Congress since. I have also been critical of too big to fail in the banking sector and have found [[Page S6689]] banking reform to be an area in which Republicans can absolutely find common ground with Democrats. That is where I found success in passing into law specific measures that restrict too-big-to-fail and tax-funded bailouts. Also during my time in Congress, I have introduced several important government reform bills so we can get back to the best traditions of our democracy, which includes electing citizen legislators, making sure they don't make themselves into a separate ruling class, and advocating for term limits so individuals don't remain in office for an eternity. Americans of all backgrounds think Washington is on a different planet and Members of Congress just don't get it. That is why I fought to end Congress's automatic pay raises each year. I first introduced that language in 2009, and the raises have been successfully blocked each year since. Congress can be an effective representative body only when it lives under the same laws it imposes on the rest of the country, and one major way to support that is through term limits. When I was a member of the Louisiana State legislature, I was successful in establishing legislative term limits there, and I have offered the leading term limits measure for Congress here, as well as imposing it on myself. I fought for commonsense legislation that helps all Americans have access to high-quality and affordable health care. That includes the work to dismantle ObamaCare and replace it with patient-centered health care reform, which I am very hopeful the incoming Trump administration will achieve. In the meantime, I have been fighting to end Washington's exemption from ObamaCare, an illegal Obama administration Executive order that allows Washington elites to avoid the most inconvenient, expensive aspects of the Affordable Care Act by giving themselves taxpayer subsidized health care through an exchange meant solely for small businesses. Also in the health care arena, I was able to pass into law the bipartisan Steve Gleason Act of 2015. It provided immediate relief for patients who have been denied access to lifesaving and life-altering medical equipment. It was about a 2014 Medicare policy change that we had to reverse. Our bill allowed these patients to have access to medical equipment that truly empowers them, that is a true lifeline, and it changes their lives absolutely for the better. I have also fought against large drug manufacturing lobbies to allow for reimportation of safe and approved prescription medicine from other countries, which gives patients, especially our seniors, relief from rising health care costs. I have been honored to serve in the Senate in additional ways as well, including as a top Republican on the Environment and Public Works Committee and most recently as chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. I am very proud to say that we have accomplished so many of our goals in those two roles. We worked in a bipartisan fashion on EPW to pass several major pieces of legislation, including the Water Resources and Development Act of 2007 and the even more significant WRDA of 2014, several reauthorizations of the highway bill, the bipartisan and historic rewrite of the 40-year-old Toxic Substances Control Act, which began as conversations between Senator Frank Lautenberg and myself, a partnership which Senator Tom Udall continued after Frank's unfortunate passing. We were also able to hold the administration accountable by conducting investigations into some outright corruption within the Obama EPA, and we advanced key transparency initiatives that shed light on government's attempts to implement policies that were not based on sound science or strategic needs. As chair of the Small Business Committee, I have been advocating to make sure the voices and concerns of small business owners across the country are heard in Washington. We have held 23 hearings here, 18 field hearings, numerous roundtable discussions. We have heard testimony from over 175 witnesses, usually about the disastrous negative effects of Obama policies like the new waters of the United States rule, key and disastrous effects on small businesses and job creators and their employees. At the very same time, we found common ground with Ranking Member Shaheen and other Democrats on the committee. During my tenure as chair, we passed 32 bipartisan bills out of the committee, which is 22 more than my predecessors did over a much longer period, and 8 of our bills have passed through the entire legislative process and have been signed into law. These accomplishments are but a fraction of the years of hard work my staff and I have dedicated to the people of Louisiana and, indeed, the American people. I have worked hard to be a champion for them because the government should serve the taxpayer and not the other way around, and that includes by working hard to stay in touch through 398 townhall meetings, at least 5 in each parish of Louisiana, through 231 telephone townhalls, and through active, energetic casework and constituent service. Clearly what I will treasure most about my service here is the people with whom I have been honored to serve; my colleagues, including my fellow Louisianian Senator Bill Cassidy, mentors like former Senator Rick Santorum and Senator Jeff Sessions, and most especially each of the dedicated people who have been part of Team Vitter. I have come to the Senate floor several times this year to thank key departing staff members. That is for a very simple reason. My staff has been the key ingredient--the key--to every success we have enjoyed together in public service. Wendy and I consider them a part of the family. I truly thank my staff again for their tireless, dedicated service to Louisiana. I am so very grateful. Wendy joins me in that. I want to specifically recognize some of our leaders: my chief of staff, Luke Bolar; my legislative director, Chris Stanley; my wonderful finance director, Courtney Guastela; our state director, Chip Layton; and committee staff director, Meredith West; our grants coordinator, Brenda Moore; my media head, John Brabender; and senior infrastructure policy advisor, Charles Brittingham; my senior economic adviser, David Stokes; campaign treasurer Bill Vanderbrook; and communications director, Cheyenne Klotz. I know a few of our other former senior staff members are here or are watching, like Mac Abrams, Joel DiGrado, Bryan Zumwalt, Travis Johnson, and Michael Long. Last, and obviously not least, is my beloved family. My five wonderful brothers and sisters, our children, their children, the extended family, led by the ultimate leader of Team Vitter, my wife Wendy. I can never thank them enough, and certainly I can never ever thank Wendy enough. Through it all, Wendy has been so enormously patient and supportive and understanding, not to mention being the life of every Team Vitter party, leading the rounds--rounds plural--of Fireball shots. She and our daughter Lise are in the Gallery today. I thank them and Sophie, Airey, and Jack for decades of love and support. Lise, up there, was in my arms as a 2-year-old when I was first sworn into the House of Representatives and made those previously quoted remarks: ``I am honored, humbled, awestruck to stand before you.'' She has changed some, but as I said at the beginning of my reflections, those feelings certainly have not. I would like to close as I did that day in the House over 17 years ago; that is, simply by recognizing the wonderful, loving forces that have brought me here today: God, family, led by my parents up above, and my wife Wendy, staff and friends, and of course the wonderful, wonderful people of Louisiana. They are here with me today. They are here with me always. I thank them from the depths of my heart. For the last time, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana. Tribute to David Vitter Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I have the honor to recognize and thank my colleague and friend, the Honorable Senator David Vitter, for his 25 years of service to Louisiana. Our State has been fortunate to have him as its voice and advocate in this Chamber for the past 12 years. On a personal note, when I arrived at the Senate, David worked with me, sharing with me some of the privileges that normally he, as a senior Senator, [[Page S6690]] could have kept all to himself. With great graciousness, he worked with me and said: Listen, this is how I think the process should be set up. I would like you to have some of this privilege as well. I will do the same with whoever replaces David. He has set a pattern that, again, by his graciousness and magnanimity, deserves repetition. As a new Senator, I was fortunate to have him as a resource for advice and knowledge that comes from time and experience in this body. There are some things that happen here that you have to kind of have experience to follow. David had both the experience, the sharpness, and the insight to recognize. I again look forward to sharing what he has taught me with whoever takes his place. I will note, as David did, he helped lead our State through some of our worst times. From Hurricane Katrina in 2005 to the great flood of 2016, all of the way in between, David has worked hard to make sure Louisiana and the people of Louisiana have what they need to recover. The hallmark of Senator Vitter's tenure is that he has always cared deeply about our State, constantly looking for what he could do that would benefit our State, not just in the short term but doing that which is consistent with his principles to help Louisiana and the United States thrive in the long term. He has been on the side of that family whose father goes for 2 weeks, works on an oil rig in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico, working hard so his family has a better future. David has been on the side of that mom juggling two jobs to earn enough to make sure her children's needs are met. A recent example--again for the short-term and long-term perspective David handled so well--he stayed persistent for years working across the aisle, first with Senator Frank Lautenberg, then Senator Udall, to pass the much needed reform of the Toxic Substances Control Act, the first reform of its kind in 40 years. This reform protects both the workers--those people on that rig, perhaps, at least the people who would be processing the products of that rig--but also gives the manufacturers of Louisiana and across the country the certainty they need to expand their businesses and create more jobs. On a lighter note, David is a great Saints fan. We in Louisiana kind of liked the fact that when the slogan ``Who Dat'' came up spontaneously, and people started to put it on their shirts and the NFL was going to go court to stop this from happening, David wrote a letter to Roger Goddell. The letter started off by saying: ``Who Dat.'' So speaking truth to power on behalf of the ``Who Dat Nation'' is one credit of his. Similarly, David was tweeting before our President-elect made it perhaps as high profile. I remember during the 2013 Super Bowl in New Orleans--and again the context of this is, the Saints had just been punished--of course Saints fans think unfairly--by Roger Goddell. So during the 2013 Super Bowl in New Orleans, when the power went out, David's tweet, without missing a beat said: ``Like most Saints fans, I am immediately assuming Roger Goddell is the chief suspect for the power outage.'' The quick-witted quip cut to the emotion of the ``Who Dat Nation.'' As the 114th Congress comes to a close, the Senate will be losing an important Member. David brings a sound, strategic mind to this Chamber that will be missed. I wish him, Wendy, their children, Lise, Sophie, Airey, and Jack, the best of luck in their journey forward. On behalf of all Louisiana, I say thank you. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana. Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana for his very kind remarks. More importantly, I want to thank him for years of great partnership, great work on behalf of Louisiana. I know he will make an outstanding senior Senator. Thank you. I yield the floor. Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the 21st Century Cures Act, and I commend the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, Senator Lamar Alexander and Senator Patty Murray, for their unwavering commitment to this very significant bipartisan legislation. The Senate HELP Committee, on which I am privileged to serve, has devoted considerable time and effort to this comprehensive legislation. It includes many reforms and priorities that will benefit so many families across our great country. The 21st Century Cures Act will support the research and development of safe treatments and cures for millions of Americans and their families who are coping with devastating diseases. It will improve the process of moving new discoveries from laboratory benches to patient bedsides. I doubt that there is a family in America who will not be touched by this important legislation in some way. All of us have a family member, a coworker, or a friend who has courageously faced the struggles of living with a debilitating chronic illness or a rare disease or who has received a devastating diagnosis and has passed away far too soon, leaving a hole in our hearts. Imagine how this could change with the passage of the 21st Century Cures Act and strong support of the research and development that will lead to new treatments and therapies that can help us achieve our dream of conquering so many devastating diseases. Simply put, this legislation matters. It matters to the children who know firsthand the burden of living with type 1 diabetes and who beg their parents for just one day off--their birthday or Christmas--from having to deal with the consequences of their juvenile diabetes. It matters to the family members who know the agonizing experience of looking into the eyes of a loved one suffering from Alzheimer's disease, only to receive a confused look in return. It matters to the parents of young boys who have Duchenne muscular dystrophy, who know what it is like to give their all in an effort to help their sons achieve their dreams, whether it is finishing college or driving a car, even as every day their children battle the progression of this debilitating and ultimately terminal illness. The 21st Century Cures Act will drive progress in medical innovation so that we can prevail against these diseases and many more that cause so much pain and suffering, so much fear and uncertainty, and so much heartbreak. There simply is no investment that we can make that provides greater return for Americans than our investment in biomedical research. It not only leads to new discoveries and the development of better treatments and even cures but also can have a dramatic effect on the budgets of families, States, and the Federal Government. The bill before us will help direct $4.8 billion to the National Institutes of Health, including $1.6 billion for the BRAIN Initiative to improve our understanding of diseases such as ALS, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's, our Nation's most costly disease. We spend $263 billion a year caring for people with Alzheimer's disease. Of that amount, approximately $160 billion comes from the Medicare and Medicaid Programs. If the current trajectory continues as our population grows older, this disease will bankrupt the Medicare and Medicaid Programs. That is why I am so pleased to see the BRAIN Initiative funded in this bill and also the work we are doing in the Appropriations Committee to boost funding for Alzheimer's disease and other dementias so that we can finally find effective treatments, a means of prevention, or perhaps even a cure for this disease that brings so much heartache not only to those suffering from it but to their families as well. Our bill will also help provide $1.8 billion for the Vice President's Cancer Moonshot. We all know that Vice President Biden has taken on this cause--a very personal one for him--because he lost his beloved son Beau to cancer. Another exciting field that will be funded by this bill is $30 million for regenerative medicine, using adult stem [[Page S6691]] cells. How exciting it was to have an individual come before our policy lunch whose sight had been restored due to innovative stem cell surgery. This individual lives in Tennessee now but happens to be from Presque Isle, ME, just 13 miles from where I was born and grew up. How I wish so many older people in this country who are losing their vision to macular degeneration and glaucoma--in some cases, a combination of both--or injuries to their eyes could benefit from this exciting development with adult stem cells, which has restored the sight of someone who was legally blind. He now can drive. That is so exciting, and that is the promise of researching regenerative medicine. In addition to support for NIH, the 21st Century Cures Act will help direct $1 billion in much needed funding to address the horrendous heroin and opioid abuse problem in this country. Maine has been particularly hard hit by this epidemic. In just the first 9 months of this year, Maine experienced a record 286 overdose deaths. That is more than one a day. Tragically, that number already exceeds the 272 overdose deaths in Maine during all of 2015. I am distressed when I hear about the lack of treatment options for Mainers who are struggling with drug addiction, particularly in rural areas. As a result of the shortage of treatment alternatives, this epidemic is playing out in emergency rooms, county jails, and on the main streets of my State. I can't tell you how many sheriffs have come to me pleading for help, telling me that the intake area of their jail looks like a detox center or an emergency room of a hospital. They are overwhelmed by these cases. We can and must do more to support access to treatment and to alert people of all ages to the risks of opioid abuse and heroin use. The 21st Century Cures Act will provide a vital infusion of $1 billion over 2 years to support grants to States to supplement treatment and prevention efforts. I was talking with one of my colleagues earlier today. Both of us remember when we were in school hearing lectures from recovering heroin addicts who came into the schools, and I can state that it was highly effective. We would never have tried heroin. I can't even think of a proper analogy. We know, unfortunately, that many of the people who are using heroin started with prescription opioids, and that is why I am encouraged by movements across our country and by actions taken, at my request and the request of other Senators, by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to make sure we are not putting pressure on providers to overprescribe opioids. Surely they are appropriate in certain cases, but the number of prescriptions has soared in this country and is twice the number prescribed on a per capita basis as in our neighboring country of Canada. The 21st Century Cures Act also includes a bill that I introduced with several of my colleagues--Senators Warren, Kirk, Baldwin, Alexander, and Murray--that is called the Advancing NIH Strategic Planning and Improving Representation in Medical Research Act. Despite its extremely cumbersome name, it is an important bill that has been incorporated into this legislation. It will require the NIH to release periodically a strategic plan outlining how the agency will meet its mission statement, and it will provide us with important guidance and metrics as we continue to work together to increase this vital funding. It will also help to ensure that study populations in clinical research are more representative of the diverse population in our country. For example, women face many of the same health threats as men, such as heart disease and cancer, but they react differently to various treatments. I remember years ago an infamous study that was called MRFIT. It had only men enrolled in it. I believe, if memory serves me correctly, it was to look at heart disease. Well, women often have different symptoms of heart disease than do men, and they respond differently to different medications, therapies, and treatments. We also know that women are at higher risk for certain chronic health conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease and osteoporosis. They suffer from those diseases in far greater numbers than do men. With Alzheimer's disease, I am wondering whether it is simply a matter that the biggest risk factor is age and women live longer than men, but perhaps there are other factors at play. My point is that by helping to ensure that women, African Americans, Latinos, and other demographic groups are appropriately represented in clinical research, we can increase our scientific understanding of the causes, risk factors, prevention strategies, and effects of treatments for diseases that commonly or disproportionately affect these populations. The bill before us also includes legislation that I introduced with my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Baldwin, to help address the educational debt burden that many young researchers face. This is so important to help ensure that America's finest, up-and-coming young researchers continue to help lead the world in biomedical discovery in this country. I don't want to lose these young talented people to other countries. I want them to stay right here. If they come to work for the NIH or the CDC or other federally funded institutions and agencies and we can get them help with their medical school, college, their advanced degrees, and their debt, that is a very good agreement for us to be making. It is also of tremendous importance that we were able to add mental health legislation to the 21st Century Cures Act. The reforms in this bill will enhance coordination, address a lack of resources, and develop real solutions to improve outcomes for individuals with serious mental illness and to help their families, who are often desperate to get them the help they need. I am pleased that the bill also includes the Mental Health on Campus Improvement Act, which I offered as an amendment when we considered the mental health legislation in committee. My colleague, Senator Dick Durbin, and I introduced this legislation for the first time in 2009. I commend him for his leadership. College students in Maine and across the country must have access to critical and often lifesaving mental health services. Despite growing demand for these critical services, far too many students still lack access. Without these services, students may experience detrimental effects that range from declining academic performance to drug dependence and to being at greater risk of suicide. While millions of Americans suffer from mental illness, only a statistical few engage in unspeakable acts of violence against themselves or others. Suicide, however, is the leading cause of death among Americans between the ages of 15 and 34. In addition, recent tragedies on college campuses, such as the shooting at a community college in Roseburg, OR, or at Northern Illinois University, highlight the dire need for mental health outreach and counseling services on college campuses. Perhaps some of the tragedies that we have witnessed might have been prevented had the resources been in place to support timely diagnosis, early intervention, and effective treatment for those struggling with severe mental illness. One of the saddest meetings I have had in the last year was with a group of families from Maine who had adult children who were suffering from severe mental illness, yet these families felt powerless in getting them the help they needed. These adult children were not compliant with the medication they had been prescribed, and in many cases their families felt powerless to be able to get them the help they needed. In one terrible case, a man's son was released from a hospital in the State of Maine--from a hospital for people with mental illness--and he killed his mother, thinking she was Al Qaeda. Only then could his father get his son the institutionalized help his son so desperately needed. It was just such a painful, painful story to hear from this anguished father and husband. I believe the language in this bill will help to change that. The 21st Century Cures Act passed the House last week by an overwhelming vote of 392 to 26. Think how few bills pass with that kind of strong, bipartisan support. It is supported by President Obama, who had an op-ed in Maine newspapers this weekend endorsing the bill. It is the product of years of bipartisan work on the Senate HELP Committee, and it has earned the support of more than 300 organizations. [[Page S6692]] Frankly, I am surprised that we are having a rollcall vote--a cloture vote on this bill. I am surprised because, while this bill may not be perfect--and no bill is--there is so much that is worthwhile, good, and significant in it that will make such a difference to so many American families. I urge all of our colleagues to vote in support of this bill so that we can quickly send it to the President's desk, where he is eager to sign it into law. It may well be the most important, far-reaching legislation that we pass this year in terms of its benefits for families across this great Nation. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Supporting Our Veterans Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of nearly 100,000 veterans who live in Montana. These are folks who have earned our deep respect and gratitude. I have traveled the State many times, listened to their ideas, and I have listened to their concerns. Montana's veterans have not been shy about expressing their views. What I have heard is this. There is no doubt that we must hold the VA accountable and work to improve access to health care, jobs, education, transportation, and housing for veterans. That is why it is critically important that we are taking marching orders from veterans and the advocacy organizations that are led by veterans, because we know that their top priority is to do right by the folks who they serve. Veterans in Montana also tell me that when it comes to solving the problems facing veterans, they expect folks in Washington, DC, to check their politics at the door and go to work. Unfortunately, there are groups out there that are funded by dark money. They hide their out-of-touch political agenda behind the veil of our Nation's veterans. As the incoming ranking member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I have serious concerns about who President-Elect Trump is listening to when it comes to honoring our veterans and this Nation's commitment to those who have worn the uniform. That is why it is so troubling that recent news reports have indicated that the Trump administration is relying heavily on guidance from Concerned Veterans for America. Concerned Veterans for America is a political advocacy group funded by the Koch brothers, who want to dump unlimited amounts of dark money to push dangerous policies that would privatize the VA or to convert the Veterans Health Administration into an independent, nongovernment- chartered, for-profit corporation. CVA also wants to divert funds from the VA and cripple its ability to plan for the long term to recruit doctors and nurses and to invest in the information technology that can improve veterans' experiences at the VA. These cuts will undermine the quality of care at the VA. There is nothing wrong with helping veterans get specialty care in the community in a timely fashion when the VA cannot do it. That often happens in rural communities, but CVA's push for wholesale dismantling of the VA is not what we want, and that is not what the veterans need. We need to talk to the veterans--the veterans I have spoken to--and this is what we will see. When folks volunteer to serve in the Armed Forces, this Nation is indebted to them. We must ensure that we deliver on those promises that are made. Privatizing the VA will fail our veterans and their families. It will reduce the quality of care that our veterans receive, and it will be more expensive for taxpayers. Privatizing the VA will ultimately mean that veterans will wait longer for doctors' appointments and the cost of care will go up. All we have to do is take a look at the Veterans Choice Program, which allows veterans to access care at private facilities. It has resulted in longer wait times, and this is unacceptable. Under this program, veterans are actually waiting longer to see doctors. Hospitals are increasingly frustrated and refusing to see veterans, and costs are going through the roof. Imagine this program on steroids. That is what the CVA wants to do--all while starving the VA's existing workforce and infrastructure. In fact, what CVA is pushing for is similar to what Speaker Ryan wants to do with Medicare, and we have seen the backlash to that proposal by seniors across this Nation. The same is true with the veterans and proposals to privatize the VA. It is simply bad policy. Groups such as the VFW, the American Legion, Disabled American Veterans, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, and many others oppose privatization, and they oppose it for good reason. The American Legion national commander, Dale Barnett, said it best: The private sector didn't send our heroes to war. Uncle Sam did. Barnett is right. The Federal Government has an obligation to honor those incredible sacrifices. When we shirk that responsibility, it dishonors those brave men and women. We need to listen to the American Legion and countless other veterans groups, whose mission is to help the veterans, not unravel the VA. Veterans service organizations are very different and have a very different mission and tax structure than Concerned Veterans for America, the first being that VSOs take their cues from the veterans they represent, not from billionaire political activists who fund their operation. Groups such as the Legion, the VFW, and Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America are organized as nonprofit groups whose missions are simply to help veterans. Concerned Veterans for America is an issue advocacy group with a political mission. VSOs disclose their donors. CVA doesn't have to. Yet CVA has incredible influence and the ear of the President-elect. This is deeply concerning to me and, more importantly, it is deeply concerning to the veterans across this Nation. I talk to veterans every week when I am home in Montana. They universally tell me that they like the care they receive from the VA once they get in the door; the problem is getting in the door. They don't want to see a private doc; they want to be seen by a VA doc. They know that the VA understands their unique issues. They know that doctors and nurses at the VA are attentive to the wounds of war. My hope is that President-elect Donald Trump starts talking with the folks who want to help veterans and not to organizations with a political agenda. My hope is that he will work with Chairman Isakson and me and countless other reputable veterans groups to hold the VA accountable while increasing access to care. My hope is that he will work with Democrats, Republicans, and Independents to reform our campaign finance laws so that we can increase transparency and know who is trying to influence this government. My hope is that he will put veterans first as he chooses the next VA Secretary. I remain hopeful that we can find common ground to work together to hold the VA accountable, to improve care, and to ensure that we are all delivering for veterans. When our brothers and sisters and sons and daughters are sent to war, we make promises to them--promises we must keep. When they come home, they are changed people, and we cannot expect the private sector to address these seen and unseen wounds of war. In this upcoming Congress, there will be incredible opportunities to make progress, and I am fully committed to Montana's veterans and veterans across this country and their families, and I will push back against those who attempt to undermine the noble mission of the Veterans' Administration. Mr. President, I yield the floor. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to support the 21st Century Cures Act, which would make vital investments in research to develop new treatments for deadly diseases, including cancer. The bill would also dedicate desperately needed funding to address some of our country's most pressing public health problems--opioid addiction and mental illness. First, I would like to speak about the bill's provisions for cancer and rare diseases. Cancer touches the lives of all Americans; it doesn't discriminate. We [[Page S6693]] have all experienced the grief and pain that comes with losing a loved one, friend, or colleague to this terrible disease. Cancer is the second leading cause of death in our country. Nearly 40 percent of Americans will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lives, according to the National Cancer Institute. We have made great strides in improving detection, treatment, and survival rates for many cancers, including early-stage breast cancer, prostate cancer, and melanoma. Despite this progress, other cancers like pancreatic and certain brain cancers remain extremely deadly, with very low 5-year survival rates. These cancers are typically detected in late stages, and even the most cutting-edge treatments may result in just a few more months of life. The Cures Act designates nearly $4.8 billion in additional funds for medical research through the National Institutes of Health, $1.8 billion of which will expand and accelerate cancer research, in line with Vice President Biden's Cancer Moonshot Initiative. This research funding also supports important initiatives focused on precision medicine and neurological research. Next, I would like to talk about the bill's funding to combat opioid addiction, which is an epidemic in this country. Nearly 2 million Americans are addicted to opioids, and 19,000 Americans overdosed and died in 2014. This epidemic stems from a surge in the use of prescription drugs. It is not a coincidence that prescription overdose deaths quadrupled during the same period that opioid prescriptions quadrupled. In 2012, 259 million prescriptions for opioids were written. That means 80 percent of Americans could have a bottle of pills. Prescription drug abuse frequently leads to heroin addiction because these drugs affect the brain in the same way. This problem is exacerbated because heroin is significantly cheaper that prescription opioids like OxyContin or fentanyl. This crisis demands an immediate, comprehensive, national response. Congress took a first step earlier this year, passing the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act in May. This bill authorizes grants to expand access to substance use disorder treatment, strengthen prescription drug monitoring programs, and supply first responders with naloxone, which can reverse the effects of an overdose. However, this bill didn't include any funding for the initiatives it authorized. The Cures Act takes that step, providing $1 billion for the Department of Health and Human Services to fund many of the prevention and treatment programs authorized by Congress earlier this year. Lastly, I would like to highlight the bill's provisions to improve our country's mental health system. This is an area where we fall far short. We don't do nearly enough to ensure those with mental illness are able to access appropriate treatment and this has ripple effects throughout society. In October, I was briefed on the homelessness crisis in Los Angeles and toured a shelter for homeless women. A significant percentage of the city's homeless population is battling mental illness. So, by improving our mental health system, we are also going to address connected issues like homelessness. Under the bill, Health and Human Services will develop a strategic plan to address mental health priorities. There is increased funding to train our doctors and nurses to better integrate substance abuse and mental health treatment into primary care visits. The bill also reauthorizes many important existing programs, including the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and the National Child Traumatic Stress Network, and increases support for mental health and drug courts. These innovative approaches to criminal justice provide an alternative process for individuals to receive and comply with needed treatment and are supported by the law enforcement community. The bill further provides for police training when police officers encounter individuals who exhibit mental illness. I recently convened meetings in Los Angeles and San Francisco with law enforcement and community leaders, and they all stressed the importance of deescalating situations with mentally ill individuals to make sure that situations do not end with violent encounters. In closing, I reiterate my support for the 21 Century Cures Act and urge its swift passage. This is a great opportunity to spur this century's medical innovation, improve access to needed treatments, and strengthen public health. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from Tennessee. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Kirk be recognized next and then Senator Murphy following him and that after that, I be recognized. We will be voting at 5:30. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Illinois. Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, 4 years ago I climbed the Capitol steps for those who could not. I vowed to return to the Senate to create and establish a standard of care for rehabilitation in this legislation to make sure many people can have access to the best rehab, as I did. With the passage of the Cures Act tomorrow, we will achieve this lofty goal. The Cures Act also contains bipartisan provisions to provide accelerated approval of regenerative medicines and therapies. The Regrow Act, which is also in this bill, is a major step forward so that Americans will not have to go to other countries for their own stem cells to be used in their own therapy. Making sure this faster approval process happens in this bill means that many more people will be able to receive advanced stem cell therapies that are also available overseas, right here at home. I would like to thank everybody. We have made progress with the FDA. I championed with Senators Collins and Manchin on this. I thank my senior colleague from Tennessee for all of his action on the Regrow Act so we can make the fundamental point of using your own stem cells to accelerate healing. In the case of using your own stem cells, they already have your exact DNA match. I think it is wise that we go through a shorter process. I thank the Senator for putting the Kirk language in the Regrow Act. I yield the floor. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, while we are waiting for Senator Murphy, let me salute Senator Kirk for his leadership from the very beginning. He has pointed out to the committee and the Senate that, as the Mayo Clinic has said, regenerative medicine is a game changer for stroke victims, for heart disease, and for people with retinal disease. Thanks to Senator Kirk, Senator Collins, Senator Manchin, and Senator McConnell, we have legislation that takes an important and responsible step forward to recognize the promise of regenerative medicine. This bill includes $30 million to the National Institutes of Health for clinical trials to support regenerative medicine. Then there are two other provisions in the bill. One of them allows the Food and Drug Administration to make regenerative therapeutic products eligible for the FDA's existing accelerated drug approval pathway. We have had great success over the last 4 or 5 years with an accelerated pathway for drugs, similar to what Senators Burr and Bennet and others got enacted into law. We are doing the same thing with combination drugs and devices in this legislation. Now Senator Kirk has added regenerative medicine to the accelerated pathway, and I salute him for that leadership. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois. Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I wish to remind my colleague, who is also the chairman of the Appropriations Energy Subcommittee that controls the exascale funding, one of the most complicated things we can face in our world is biological systems when we look at the new Aurora computer that is going to be built in the Argonne National Laboratories. I know that at Oak Ridge, we have exascale computers. My goal is to make sure we are always way ahead of the Chinese. In the case of Aurora, we now have $165 million to make sure that we have a computer that is far faster than the computer in China. With that, we will be able to model proteins themselves to make sure we make these advances much faster. My hope is that we will be [[Page S6694]] stunned at how much biological work is being done at the Oak Ridge lab with their leading computer to make sure we accelerate progress on this. Let me say one thing about the work of the Senator. Every piece of legislation that he touches goes through by a couple hundred votes. When we see Lamar take over a bill, we know it is going to be going through on a big walloping. He got a huge vote in the Senate, and I hope he gets a big vote again. Everything he touches turns to gold, and we cannot have a better friend in medical care than we have in Lamar Alexander. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois is very generous, and I thank him, but I would remind him that he was the persistent agent for the change in support for regenerative medicine. That wasn't easy to do, and he has been the leader, along with others of us who cared about the same thing, in making sure the United States maintains its lead in supercomputing competition around the world. Senator Murphy, the Senator from Connecticut, is coming. I think what I will do is begin, and when he comes I will stop and let him make his 5 minutes of remarks and then resume so I don't delay the vote because I know everyone is looking forward to casting a great big ``yes'' vote in a few minutes. The U.S. Senate majority leader, whose position in the Senate this is, has said more than once in private meetings I attended and on the floor of this body that the 21st Century Cures bill on which we will be voting in a few minutes is the most important legislation Congress will pass this year. In his address to the Nation this past weekend, President Obama urged us to vote for the bill today and tomorrow. ``It could help us find a cure for Alzheimer's,'' the President said. ``It could end cancer as we know it and help those seeking treatment for opioid addiction.'' The President continued: ``It's an opportunity to save lives and an opportunity we just can't miss.'' Vice President Biden has been telephoning Senators urging support for 21st Century Cures because, in the Vice President's words, it is a big step for cancer research and the Cancer Moonshot that is so close to his heart. Speaker Paul Ryan in the House of Representatives has made 21st Century Cures explicitly a centerpiece of his vision for our country's future, describing it as ``bipartisan legislation that would accelerate the discovery, development, and delivery of lifesaving treatments.'' With such bipartisan support from the President of the United States, the Vice President of the United States, the Speaker of the House, the Senate majority leader--two Democrats, two Republicans--it is no wonder that on last Wednesday, the House of Representatives approved 21st Century Cures by the overwhelming vote of 392 to 26. This legislation holds the promise of improving the life and health of virtually every family in the country. It will provide $4.8 billion in a one-time surge of funding for biomedical research in a time of breathtaking opportunity. It will advance Vice President Biden's Cancer Moonshot to find cures for cancer and President Obama's Precision Medicine Initiative, as well as the BRAIN Initiative. It will help move safe and effective treatments and cures through the development and regulatory process more rapidly, and it will lower costs, making medicines available sooner and hopefully also at lower costs to patients. It will provide $1 billion in grants to help deal with the raging opioid epidemic. It includes legislation to help the one in five adults in this country suffering from a mental illness, help them receive treatment by updating many of our country's mental health programs for the first time in a decade. It will improve health information technology for doctors who are eager to get rid of the overdocumentation of hospitals and their patients and help get the Nation's electronic health records system out of the ditch. From a taxpayer's point of view, it does all of these things in a fiscally responsible way by reducing other spending to pay for every penny of the $6.3 billion cost. I see the Senator from Connecticut on the floor, so I would like to suspend my remarks for 5 minutes so that he can make his, and then I would ask unanimous consent that the totality of my remarks follow his remarks. Before he speaks, let me just say once again how much I appreciate his leadership and that of Senator Cassidy and Senator Cornyn. One reason the majority leader calls this the most important piece of legislation Congress will act on this year is because it includes the mental health legislation that these Senators, including Senator Murphy, Senator Cornyn, and Senator Cassidy, have offered. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut. Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Alexander's kindness in allowing me to say a few words in support of this bill on behalf of myself and Senator Murray. I wish to congratulate Senator Alexander for once again showing how the Senate can work properly, how we can bring together Republicans and Democrats for a priority that really has nothing to do with whether one is a Republican or a Democrat or whether one voted for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. If people are out there suffering from a life-altering or potentially terminal disease or suffering from mental illness or addiction, they need help, and we are coming together in maybe one of the most important pieces of health legislation that has passed this Congress in a very long time to deliver that help. So I am not going to endeavor to recreate the remarks of Senator Alexander when it comes to describing the important aspects of this bill except to say that after passage of this bill, it is going to be a whole heck of a lot more likely that a life-changing, lifesaving drug is going to be able to make it to market in time to save a life. Every single one of the underlying reforms in this bill to the drug discovery process is bipartisan. I think about Senators Bennet and Hatch's bill, the promise for antibiotics and therapeutics for health, which establishes a new pathway for antibacterial and antifungal drugs that will treat serious, life-threatening infections for patients. I think about Senator Casey and Senator Isakson working on the Advancing Hope Act, which will extend the pediatric priority review voucher program until 2020. It incentivizes drug companies to research treatment for life-altering diseases that impact pediatric patients. Inside this bill are all sorts of good, important, bipartisan achievements. As Senator Alexander noted, there is also help on the way for people suffering from addiction. In my tiny little State--only 1 percent of the Nation's population--we are going to have over 800 people die this year from drug overdoses. Yes, we need to get to the source of that epidemic and stop people from getting addicted to pain medications in the first place, but, boy, we have an awful lot of people showing up with overdoses in our emergency rooms who have no place to go, have no detox programs, no long-term residential programs. The $1 billion authorized in this legislation to fight the opioid epidemic is going to save lives in my little State. Finally, when it comes to the issue of mental health--Senator Alexander, Senator Cassidy, and I were on the floor last week talking about this legislation; the focus on funding prevention, the focus on making sure parents are part of the care for their adult children, the focus on ensuring that insurance companies really do pay attention to the Parity Act we passed 10 years ago in this Congress to assure that you get covered for mental illness just like physical illness. A broken leg really isn't any different than a broken brain when we think about it. We can treat both. These are important advances in mental health as well. I know this place has a bad reputation; that people pay attention to the fights here more often than they do to the moments where we get together and cooperate. The 21st Century Cures Act that Senator Murray and Senator Alexander, with help from Senator Cornyn, me, Senator Cassidy, and in the House Congressmen Upton, Pallone, Tim Murphy, and Eddie Bernice Johnson--this is an example of how this place can work better. As we head in to what may be a very charged atmosphere in January, I hope we remember this moment. I wanted to [[Page S6695]] come down on behalf of Senator Murray, who has helped shepherd this process, to congratulate Senator Alexander on it and recommend its passage to all of my colleagues. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his words, support, and his leadership this year. I thank also Senator Murray from Washington. She would be here, except her plane is delayed. The vote will be held open to make sure she can be here, but Senator Murray is a Member of the Democratic leadership and well respected on that side of the aisle but also on this side of the aisle because, when she can, she creates an environment where we can do today exactly what we are doing today. I think the American people appreciate that, and Senator Murphy and I both benefit from that. I thank the Senator for those remarks and will now continue my remarks. At a Senate hearing earlier this year, Dr. Francis Collins, the distinguished head of the National Institutes of Health--an agency he calls the ``National Institutes of Hope''--offered ``bold predictions'' about major advances to expect in the next 10 years from sustained investments in biomedical research, such as we are doing with this bill. One prediction is that scientists will find ways to identify individuals at risk for Alzheimer's even before symptoms appear, as well as how to slow or even prevent the disease. Today, Alzheimer's causes untold family grief and costs $236 billion a year. Left unchecked, the cost in 2050 would be more than our Nation spends on national defense. Dr. Collins' other predictions are equally breathtaking. Using stem cells, doctors could use a patient's own cells to rebuild his or her heart. This personalized rebuilt heart, Dr. Collins says, would make transplant waiting lists and anti-rejection drugs obsolete. He expects development of an artificial pancreas to help diabetes patients by tracking blood glucose levels and creating precise doses of insulin. He says a Zika vaccine should be widely available by 2018, with universal flu vaccine and HIV/AIDS vaccine available within the decade. To relieve suffering and deal with the epidemic of opioid addiction that led to 28,000 overdose deaths in America in 2014, he predicts new nonaddictive medicines to manage pain, an even more effective antidote than the $1 billion we would be authorizing by our votes today. These truly would be miracles. The bill has taken more than 2 years to assemble both in the Senate and the House. There have been major differences of opinion, but the resolution of those differences--thanks to Senator Murray and many other Senators--has been bipartisan every step of the way. We saw that on display in the work of the President, the Vice President, the Speaker of the House, and the Senate majority leader. We saw it in the House with its vote of 392 to 26 last week, thanks especially to the leadership of Chairman Upton, Ranking Member Pallone, and Representative DeGette. We saw it in our Senate Health Committee, where we approved 19 bills that include 50 proposals, and every one with both a Democratic and Republican sponsor, except for 1 bill offered solely by Senator Murray, who is the ranking Democratic member of our committee. We have a diverse committee of 22 Members--that would be an understatement, actually--some of the most liberal Members and some of the most conservative Members, but when our committee considered these 19 bills during our 3 markups held over several months, the largest number of votes against any one of these 19 bipartisan bills was 2. Let me say that again. The largest number of votes--recorded votes--against any one of these 19 bipartisan bills was 2 in our committee of 22. Here is what some of those 19 bipartisan bills--again, approved unanimously or by a wide margin--would do to help move safe and effective treatments and cures more rapidly through the regulatory process and into patients' medicine cabinets and into doctors' offices. For example, Senators Bennet, Warren, Burr, and Hatch's act would allow researchers to use their own data from previously approved therapies when they submit for review a treatment or cure for serious rare genetic diseases, like Duchenne's, a rare kind of muscular dystrophy that could impact children as young as 3. Senators Burr and Franken's legislation will help to bring innovative medical devices--such as artificial knees, insulin pumps, and heart stents--to patients more quickly by getting rid of unnecessary burdens in medical device evaluations and streamlining the review process for clinical trials. Senators Baldwin and Collins have a bill to improve opportunities for our young researchers, essential to advancing biomedical research. Senator Kirk just talked about his legislation with Bennet, Hatch, Murkowski, Isakson, and Collins to improve rehabilitation research and help the approximately 800,000 Americans who suffer a stroke each year. Senators Isakson, Murphy, Casey, Wicker, and Vitter will help advance our understanding of neurological diseases. Senator Murray, as I mentioned earlier, will clarify that the FDA requires cleaning and validation data for reusable medical devices. Senators Murray, Hatch, Bennet, Cassidy and Whitehouse's bill will improve health information technology for doctors and their patients. We had six hearings on medical information technology programs in a ditch. We think we are helping to get them out of the ditch. We have been working with the Obama administration to do that, and I look forward to working with the Trump administration to continue that. Senators Burr, Bennet, Hatch, and Donnelly would speed safe breakthrough devices, putting senior people in charge of the review process. Casey, Isakson, Brown, and Kirk's legislation. If you are the parent of a child with a rare disease like brain cancer, their bill would increase the likelihood that your child will be able to take a drug that will help by giving a drug company that develops a drug for such a disease a voucher they could keep or sell that would speed up the review of another drug. One may say this is getting boring. This is too long. It is not boring to the millions of Americans who stand to benefit from this, and it is exactly the kind of work we ought to be doing in the United States Senate and what the American people would like to see us do more of. The Medical Electronic Data Technology Enhancement Act, with Senators Bennet and Hatch and many others interested in that. Senators Burr and Casey and Isakson and Roberts have important legislation for planning ahead for events like bioterror attacks, to help protect against anthrax, for example, or smallpox. The Combination Products Innovation Act, with a number of Senators involved on the committee, will help prevent the growing field of combination products--like bandaids with Neosporin built in or a heart stent that can be implanted to deliver blood thinners to prevent clots--from being caught in redtape. Then there is legislation that will give patients and their families a voice in drug development. There is one that is a top priority for the heads of FDA and NIH which will help those agencies attract and keep the kind of talent they need to approve all these exciting advances that are coming. There is legislation to shorten the development of new treatments to help those affected with life-threatening superbugs. The Advancing Precision Medicine Act, which Senator Murray and I cosponsored, is in direct support of President Obama's initiative to map 1 million genomes so researchers can develop treatments and cures tailored to a patient's genome. There are five or six other major pieces of legislation that I will include in the Record but not read at this time because we are approaching the time for a vote, but let me conclude by saying that in addition to these bipartisan policies, the 21st Century Cures bill includes $6.3 billion in funding. We usually don't attach such funding to a bill authorizing programs. We usually work [[Page S6696]] along two tracks; one track for authorizing programs and one deciding how much to spend on those programs. During the last 2 years, while we have been working on our authorizing legislation, our appropriations committees have recommended major increases in support for biomedical research, and it is important that every Senator know this. In the current year, at the urging of Senators Blunt and Senator Murray, Congress added $2 billion a year to the $32 billion budget of the National Institutes of Health, which could total $20 billion over 10 years. Then, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended another $2 billion increase for the next fiscal year, 2017, which could total another $20 billion over 10 years. This 21st Century Cures legislation adds $4.8 billion in a surge of one-time spending for the National Institutes of Health on top of the regular appropriated money toward key objectives: $1.8 billion for the Cancer Moonshot, $1.4 billion for precision medicine, $1.6 for the BRAIN Initiative, and it adds $1 billion for State grants to help States fight the opioid abuse epidemic. I believe that for every State represented by a Senator here tonight, the opioid epidemic is on the front pages of the newspapers. It adds $500 million for the Food and Drug Administration, and 21st Century Cures also gives the National Institutes of Health $30 million for clinical trials to support regenerative medicine, which the Mayo Clinic has described as a ``game- changing area of medicine with the potential to fully heal damaged tissues and organs, offering solutions and hope for people who have conditions that are beyond repair.'' It gives the FDA authority to allow regenerative therapeutic products to be eligible for FDA's existing accelerated drug approval pathway. I wish to acknowledge the work of Speaker Ryan and Leader McConnell in designing a way to secure funding that both Democrats and Republicans can accept. That is not always easy. For those concerned about additional spending--often on our side of the aisle--Speaker Ryan and House Budget Chairman Tom Price made sure the funding is one time, not mandatory, paid for, and approved each year by Appropriations Committees. It doesn't add one penny to the overall budget because for every increase in the discretionary budget, we reduce the same amount in the mandatory ledger. For those who worry that Congress might not approve the $6.3 billion in additional spending in later years--I have heard a little of that from the other side of the aisle--my answer is that the best way to ensure the money is spent in the following years is a big vote today and tomorrow when we finally pass the bill, just as the House did last week. In conclusion, it will be hard to explain why you voted to spend $6.3 billion for cancer, the Precision Medicine Initiative, and opioids this year but then voted not to spend it next year, and the legislation provides that the money cannot be diverted for any other purpose than what we vote for today and tomorrow. In addition, this year's portion of Cures funding--including one-half billion for opioid grants--is included in the continuing resolution that we will vote on later this week. This is the kind of lasting legacy the President of the United States and our Congress can be proud of. The next administration or the next Congress will not be repealing this law because we have taken the time to work out our differences and create a consensus of support. We did this at this time last year with an equally complicated bill to fix No Child Left Behind, which, despite its complexities, received 85 votes in this body. When he signed it, the President called it a ``Christmas miracle.'' The 21st Century Cures bill will present President Obama with another Christmas miracle, one that will help virtually every family. When we pass this legislation, the real winners will be the American families whose lives will be improved by this bipartisan legislation. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, with the permission of my distinguished chairman, who has worked very hard on this bill and whose efforts I appreciate very much, I wanted to add, very briefly, that I hope very much and look forward to working with my colleagues to assure that the second tranche of the opioid funding is aligned with the CARA bill, or the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, which we just passed in such bipartisan fashion a few months ago. We have not achieved that alignment yet, and I hope that we do very soon. I appreciate the terrific efforts of my chairman. With that, I yield. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The VICE PRESIDENT.

[[page s6687]] jim was smart as a whip. he was a tremendously valuable congressional staffer because he had both a remarkable understanding of tax policy and an uncanny ability to see all the traps and pitfalls that stood ahead for any particular proposal or piece of legislation. he had an encyclopedic knowledge of the technical aspects of the tax code, as well as a clear understanding of the real-world implications, immediately seeing where a particular tax policy or bill would fit in the larger policy and, when necessary, the political landscape. jim was one of those people who could go into the weeds to discuss, debate, and negotiate tax policy literally with anyone on the planet but also break that same policy down to its essential elements and explain it to lesser mortals, including, i have to say, more than a few of us u.s. senators. of course, like all of us, jim had his own ideological views and opinions, and he made no secret about the way he saw the world and his beliefs about the best path forward for our country. when necessary, he was a fierce advocate for his own views, but more importantly, for someone in his position, he was able, when necessary, to dispassionately apply his accrued knowledge and expertise to any tax proposal, whether it came from a conservative or liberal or a republican or democrat, and then break it down to its essence and give a clear and concise assessment of the policy and its chances for being enacted. all of this made him an essential and indispensable part of our efforts on the senate finance committee for close to a decade. as i think all of my colleagues will attest, staffers with that kind of knowledge and ability to evaluate policy and lay out its chances for success really can be hard to come by. however, in the weeks since jim's passing, it hasn't been his accomplishments or his knowledge of the tax code that people have most remembered; instead, most of the focus has been on his friendly demeanor, his mischievous sense of humor, and most of all, his kind heart. dozens of jimmy's friends and colleagues visited jim and his family in the hospital during his final days, and during the october recess, hundreds attended a memorial service held here in the capitol. each one of these people had at least one personal story to share about jim. sure, some of the stories did touch on his successes as a staffer and his professional disposition, but far more often the stories were about jim's kindness, even to strangers, or his ability to make people feel at ease--and sometimes laugh uncontrollably--even in tense situations. jim was always quick to offer assistance and comfort to those in need and to provide a much needed laugh when things got really tough. he is one of very few people i have come across on capitol hill--and keep in mind i have been here a while--who will be remembered more or less equally for the bills he successfully drafted and negotiated and for the way he cracked everyone up at the negotiating table. i think my favorite story i have heard about jim came from his mother ann. in 2003, jim was living in new york city when much of that part of the country suffered a massive blackout. it is difficult to be in a place like new york without power, and jim noticed many people on his way home who were stranded and in need of assistance. rather than look down at the ground and head quickly for home, as many would probably want to do in that situation, jim offered help to a dozen or so people, bringing them all home to his apartment, giving them both food and a comfortable space to ride out the power outage. most of these people were strangers. yet jim, ever the kind soul, offered his time and his home to help them through a difficult evening. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that a copy of pages 14 and 15 from the august 2003 edition of cleargolaw news, a newsletter for the law firm where jim worked at that time, be printed in the record following my remarks. the article tells the story of jim's efforts during the power blackout. these are the types of stories that have constantly been shared since jim's passing, and i know these memories and stories from people who knew and worked with jim have been helpful to his family during this difficult time. when i hear these accounts of people's interactions with jim, i am reminded of a popular hymn in my church, which reads: each life that touches ours for good reflects thine own great mercy, lord; thou sendest blessings from above thru words and deeds of those who love. what greater gift dost thou bestow, what greater goodness can we know than christ-like friends, whose gentle ways strengthen our faith, enrich our days. when such a friend from us departs, we hold forever in our hearts a sweet and hallowed memory, bringing us nearer, lord, to thee. jim lyons led a life which touched many others for the better. his positive influence has been felt by countless people, pretty much anyone who had the opportunity to interact with him. i personally already miss jim's stalwart presence on the finance committee. i miss his wise and plain-spoken advice and unequalled knowledge of tax policy. more than that, i miss the kind and humorous manner that endeared jim to so many of us working in and around the senate. there is a simple quote--an anonymous proverb of sorts--that has often been attributed to dr. seuss, though its origin is ultimately in dispute: ``don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened.'' over the past couple of months, i think that has been the prevailing sentiment among those of us who were lucky enough to know jim lyons. while tears have been shed and great sadness has been felt, the remembrances we have had of jim's life and our interactions with him have given all of us reason to smile and even laugh. i want to once again express my condolences to jim's family, his parents stephen and ann, his brother steve, his two nephews, tyler and blake, and of course his beloved dog buddy. recently, i have had the opportunity to spend time with and get to know jim's wonderful family. they are truly extraordinary people, and my prayers continue to go out to them. i know i am not alone in that regard. i care for them. everybody who knew jim and has now known them cares for them. our sympathy and our heartfelt thanks go out to them for allowing their son to become the great person he became, and, of course, allowing him to come and work with us on capitol hill. there being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the record, as follows: thank you for taking care of us (by alice steinert) here is a wonderfully refreshing story about a truly good, kind person. the day of the blackout was scary for some, devastating for others, and just plain inconvenient for many. there are those of us who still have thighs and calves that ache from all those flights of stairs! many people could not get home that night for a number of reasons--1) after walking down that many flights of stairs, some people were a bit lame and therefore could not walk the distance to their homes, or their homes were too far to walk to; 2) there were few, if any, buses, taxi cabs, cars, trains, ferries, no subways, and no hotel vacancies; 3) etc., etc., etc. but, for those of us fortunate enough to know jim lyons, cgsh associate extraordinaire, we certainly know the meaning of the true human spirit. jim invited many people to his home that day when we had to evacuate olp. he provided an immediate ``base'' for people to relax, calm down, regroup, make contact with family/friends, eat, drink, whatever they needed. but, for nine of us (ron becton, robert franklin, monica gagnon, glenville hunter, amy menendez, alice steinert, jason steinert, naj-lah toussaint and carol whatley), he provided much, much more. he provided a safe haven for the night. at about 7:45 p.m. jim walked from his home to olp to see if there was anyone else in need of assistance. well, he found nine of us who were seriously thinking about bunking down for the night in front of the lobby doors. without hesitation jim invited all of us to his home (he had never even met some of us before). not only did he provide us with a roof over our heads, he also offered food and beverage, the use of his cell phone, pillows and blankets, and even gave up his bed to two of us ladies. not only that, he bought toothbrushes for us; what ensued was a night we will all remember--good people, stimulating conversation, a lot of fun, and a great deal of bonding and comeraderie. while we will individually, and as a group, thank jim, i think everyone in the firm should recognize what an exceptional person jim is. if there were more ``jim's'' in the world, what a different place it would be. god bless you jim. remembering king bhumibol adulyadej of thailand mr. hatch. mr. president, i rise today, december 5, 2016, in commemoration of the 89th birthday of the late [[page s6688]] king bhumibol adulyadej of thailand and in recognition of the national day of thailand. in remembrance of the extraordinary life, steady leadership, and remarkable 70-year reign of the beloved king bhumibol, i have introduced s. con. res. 57, along with representative matt salmon in the house. this resolution honors the late king's lasting legacy, extends our collective condolences to the royal family and the people of thailand, and celebrates the alliance and friendship between our two nations. i would like to thank the cosponsors of this resolution, senators whitehouse, roberts, markey, flake, cotton, and gardner. additionally, i express my appreciation to chairman bob corker for his assistance in receiving timely consideration of this bipartisan effort in the senate foreign relations committee. his majesty, king bhumibol adulyadej, enjoyed a special relationship with the united states, having been born in cambridge, ma, in 1927, while his father was completing his medical studies at harvard university. he was always a trusted friend of the united states in advancing a strong and enduring alliance and partnership between our two countries. at the time of his death on october 13, 2016, king bhumibol adulyadej was the longest serving head of state in the world and the longest serving in the history of thailand. he dedicated his life to the well- being of the thai people and the sustainable development of his country. his majesty was an anchor of peace and stability for thailand and for the region, earning him the deep reverence of the thai people and the respect of leaders around the world. i hope my colleagues will join me tomorrow in passing s. con. res. 57 as a gesture of respect and appreciation for the life of this great leader and as a symbol of our continued commitment to and friendship with thailand. additionally, i am sure my colleagues in the senate will join me in offering our warmest congratulations and best wishes to the new king of thailand, his majesty king maha vajiralongkorn. mr. president, i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the

rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. farewell to the senate mr. vitter. mr. president, i rise today to speak on the senate floor for the last time. i am not generally big on nostalgic reminiscences, but i would like to briefly reflect on what is clearly the greatest honor of my professional life--my 12 years in the u.s. senate and 5\1/ 2\ years in the u.s. house of representatives and the enormous honor of serving the people of louisiana to whom i will always be so deeply indebted. in some ways it seems like just yesterday that i was on the floor of the u.s. house being sworn in, surrounded by our very young children, except for jack, who wasn't born yet. i said then: ``i am honored, humbled, awestruck to stand before you today.'' i stated my simple goal: to become at ease and comfortable as i learn the ways of congress, as i hopefully become an effective representative and respected colleague and friend, but never to become so at ease and comfortable that i lose these feelings of honor, of humility, of awe, and, believe me, i haven't. my very first year in the senate was a very memorable one. that year louisiana was struck by hurricanes rita and katrina. after the initial shock of those cataclysmic events, i realized that for quite some time, my priorities as louisiana senator would be dominated by the desperate need to rebuild our state, including dramatically improving our hurricane and flood protection and restoring our coastline. katrina's devastation was hard to imagine, destroying much of southeast louisiana and coastal mississippi. less than 1 month later, hurricane rita slammed into southwest louisiana as another one of the most intense hurricanes in history. i immediately went to work with senator landrieu and the rest of our louisiana delegation as well as my good friends thad cochran, trent lott, and others to secure the necessary disaster recovery assistance and also to make reforms to the army corps of engineers to better protect our families and communities from future natural disasters. louisiana has continued to face and survive other major disasters, including hurricane gustav in august and september 2008, hurricane ike in september of that same year, hurricane isaac in 2012, the red river flooding in northern and central louisiana, and the 1,000-year-flood event in greater baton rouge and acadiana this past august. as if all of that weren't enough, in april of 2010, the deepwater horizon oil rig exploded off the coast of louisiana, killing 11 men and devastating our coastline. the disaster, followed by the horribly misguided offshore drilling moratorium president obama put in place, caused economic and environmental chaos in louisiana. once again, i immediately went to work with so many others to increase and improve safety measures and reopen the gulf of mexico to energy exploration and put people back to work. we introduced legislation to dedicate a majority of the bp penalties toward restoring coastal ecosystems and economies damaged by the spill. it was an uphill battle to ensure louisiana was fairly compensated, but we did, and we achieved substantial wins, including passage of that critical restore act that i described. during the recovery fight following each of these disasters, i found that the most effective leadership involved communicating clearly and employing solutions based on louisiana common sense, and what always inspired me and kept me going was the unbelievable resilience, faith, and determination of my fellow louisianans. their strength and optimism have been oh so powerful reminders of how blessed i have been to serve them. on a host of other important issues, i always sought to further two sets of political values, really modeled after my two favorite presidents, ronald reagan and teddy roosevelt. i always strove to further the central american tradition of limited government and individual freedom, and i was never afraid to shake things up, to demand needed reforms to ensure that leaders in washington served the american people and not the other way around. i have had the honor of protecting louisiana's traditions and proud heritage while here in the senate. louisianans love the outdoors and want strong environmental conservation and sportsmen's policies to maintain that culture, and that certainly includes securing the rights afforded to each american by the second amendment, which i have fought to do. louisianans respect the sanctity of life, which has been one of my top priorities while serving in congress. i have introduced many bills that end taxpayer funding of abortion and abortion mills and have proudly stood in the defense of life. when it comes to our nation's immigration policies, i have been an advocate for targeted reforms that fix the immigration crisis, starting with border security and enforcing the immigration laws already on the books. i fought president obama's unconstitutional attempts to implement executive amnesty, which only encourages more immigrants to come here illegally and insults the millions of fine immigrants who do follow u.s. law. i was also the first to introduce legislation in 2007 to end dangerous sanctuary city policies and have continued to do so each congress since. i have also been critical of too big to fail in the banking sector and have found [[page s6689]] banking reform to be an area in which republicans can absolutely find common ground with democrats. that is where i found success in passing into law specific measures that restrict too-big-to-fail and tax-funded bailouts. also during my time in congress, i have introduced several important government reform bills so we can get back to the best traditions of our democracy, which includes electing citizen legislators, making sure they don't make themselves into a separate ruling class, and advocating for term limits so individuals don't remain in office for an eternity. americans of all backgrounds think washington is on a different planet and members of congress just don't get it. that is why i fought to end congress's automatic pay raises each year. i first introduced that language in 2009, and the raises have been successfully blocked each year since. congress can be an effective representative body only when it lives under the same laws it imposes on the rest of the country, and one major way to support that is through term limits. when i was a member of the louisiana state legislature, i was successful in establishing legislative term limits there, and i have offered the leading term limits measure for congress here, as well as imposing it on myself. i fought for commonsense legislation that helps all americans have access to high-quality and affordable health care. that includes the work to dismantle obamacare and replace it with patient-centered health care reform, which i am very hopeful the incoming trump administration will achieve. in the meantime, i have been fighting to end washington's exemption from obamacare, an illegal obama administration executive order that allows washington elites to avoid the most inconvenient, expensive aspects of the affordable care act by giving themselves taxpayer subsidized health care through an exchange meant solely for small businesses. also in the health care arena, i was able to pass into law the bipartisan steve gleason act of 2015. it provided immediate relief for patients who have been denied access to lifesaving and life-altering medical equipment. it was about a 2014 medicare policy change that we had to reverse. our bill allowed these patients to have access to medical equipment that truly empowers them, that is a true lifeline, and it changes their lives absolutely for the better. i have also fought against large drug manufacturing lobbies to allow for reimportation of safe and approved prescription medicine from other countries, which gives patients, especially our seniors, relief from rising health care costs. i have been honored to serve in the senate in additional ways as well, including as a top republican on the environment and public works committee and most recently as chair of the senate committee on small business and entrepreneurship. i am very proud to say that we have accomplished so many of our goals in those two roles. we worked in a bipartisan fashion on epw to pass several major pieces of legislation, including the water resources and development act of 2007 and the even more significant wrda of 2014, several reauthorizations of the highway bill, the bipartisan and historic rewrite of the 40-year-old toxic substances control act, which began as conversations between senator frank lautenberg and myself, a partnership which senator tom udall continued after frank's unfortunate passing. we were also able to hold the administration accountable by conducting investigations into some outright corruption within the obama epa, and we advanced key transparency initiatives that shed light on government's attempts to implement policies that were not based on sound science or strategic needs. as chair of the small business committee, i have been advocating to make sure the voices and concerns of small business owners across the country are heard in washington. we have held 23 hearings here, 18 field hearings, numerous roundtable discussions. we have heard testimony from over 175 witnesses, usually about the disastrous negative effects of obama policies like the new waters of the united states rule, key and disastrous effects on small businesses and job creators and their employees. at the very same time, we found common ground with ranking member shaheen and other democrats on the committee. during my tenure as chair, we passed 32 bipartisan bills out of the committee, which is 22 more than my predecessors did over a much longer period, and 8 of our bills have passed through the entire legislative process and have been signed into law. these accomplishments are but a fraction of the years of hard work my staff and i have dedicated to the people of louisiana and, indeed, the american people. i have worked hard to be a champion for them because the government should serve the taxpayer and not the other way around, and that includes by working hard to stay in touch through 398 townhall meetings, at least 5 in each parish of louisiana, through 231 telephone townhalls, and through active, energetic casework and constituent service. clearly what i will treasure most about my service here is the people with whom i have been honored to serve; my colleagues, including my fellow louisianian senator bill cassidy, mentors like former senator rick santorum and senator jeff sessions, and most especially each of the dedicated people who have been part of team vitter. i have come to the senate floor several times this year to thank key departing staff members. that is for a very simple reason. my staff has been the key ingredient--the key--to every success we have enjoyed together in public service. wendy and i consider them a part of the family. i truly thank my staff again for their tireless, dedicated service to louisiana. i am so very grateful. wendy joins me in that. i want to specifically recognize some of our leaders: my chief of staff, luke bolar; my legislative director, chris stanley; my wonderful finance director, courtney guastela; our state director, chip layton; and committee staff director, meredith west; our grants coordinator, brenda moore; my media head, john brabender; and senior infrastructure policy advisor, charles brittingham; my senior economic adviser, david stokes; campaign treasurer bill vanderbrook; and communications director, cheyenne klotz. i know a few of our other former senior staff members are here or are watching, like mac abrams, joel digrado, bryan zumwalt, travis johnson, and michael long. last, and obviously not least, is my beloved family. my five wonderful brothers and sisters, our children, their children, the extended family, led by the ultimate leader of team vitter, my wife wendy. i can never thank them enough, and certainly i can never ever thank wendy enough. through it all, wendy has been so enormously patient and supportive and understanding, not to mention being the life of every team vitter party, leading the rounds--rounds plural--of fireball shots. she and our daughter lise are in the gallery today. i thank them and sophie, airey, and jack for decades of love and support. lise, up there, was in my arms as a 2-year-old when i was first sworn into the house of representatives and made those previously quoted remarks: ``i am honored, humbled, awestruck to stand before you.'' she has changed some, but as i said at the beginning of my reflections, those feelings certainly have not. i would like to close as i did that day in the house over 17 years ago; that is, simply by recognizing the wonderful, loving forces that have brought me here today: god, family, led by my parents up above, and my wife wendy, staff and friends, and of course the wonderful, wonderful people of louisiana. they are here with me today. they are here with me always. i thank them from the depths of my heart. for the last time, i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from louisiana. tribute to david vitter mr. cassidy. mr. president, i have the honor to recognize and thank my colleague and friend, the honorable senator david vitter, for his 25 years of service to louisiana. our state has been fortunate to have him as its voice and advocate in this chamber for the past 12 years. on a personal note, when i arrived at the senate, david worked with me, sharing with me some of the privileges that normally he, as a senior senator, [[page s6690]] could have kept all to himself. with great graciousness, he worked with me and said: listen, this is how i think the process should be set up. i would like you to have some of this privilege as well. i will do the same with whoever replaces david. he has set a pattern that, again, by his graciousness and magnanimity, deserves repetition. as a new senator, i was fortunate to have him as a resource for advice and knowledge that comes from time and experience in this body. there are some things that happen here that you have to kind of have experience to follow. david had both the experience, the sharpness, and the insight to recognize. i again look forward to sharing what he has taught me with whoever takes his place. i will note, as david did, he helped lead our state through some of our worst times. from hurricane katrina in 2005 to the great flood of 2016, all of the way in between, david has worked hard to make sure louisiana and the people of louisiana have what they need to recover. the hallmark of senator vitter's tenure is that he has always cared deeply about our state, constantly looking for what he could do that would benefit our state, not just in the short term but doing that which is consistent with his principles to help louisiana and the united states thrive in the long term. he has been on the side of that family whose father goes for 2 weeks, works on an oil rig in the middle of the gulf of mexico, working hard so his family has a better future. david has been on the side of that mom juggling two jobs to earn enough to make sure her children's needs are met. a recent example--again for the short-term and long-term perspective david handled so well--he stayed persistent for years working across the aisle, first with senator frank lautenberg, then senator udall, to pass the much needed reform of the toxic substances control act, the first reform of its kind in 40 years. this reform protects both the workers--those people on that rig, perhaps, at least the people who would be processing the products of that rig--but also gives the manufacturers of louisiana and across the country the certainty they need to expand their businesses and create more jobs. on a lighter note, david is a great saints fan. we in louisiana kind of liked the fact that when the slogan ``who dat'' came up spontaneously, and people started to put it on their shirts and the nfl was going to go court to stop this from happening, david wrote a letter to roger goddell. the letter started off by saying: ``who dat.'' so speaking truth to power on behalf of the ``who dat nation'' is one credit of his. similarly, david was tweeting before our president-elect made it perhaps as high profile. i remember during the 2013 super bowl in new orleans--and again the context of this is, the saints had just been punished--of course saints fans think unfairly--by roger goddell. so during the 2013 super bowl in new orleans, when the power went out, david's tweet, without missing a beat said: ``like most saints fans, i am immediately assuming roger goddell is the chief suspect for the power outage.'' the quick-witted quip cut to the emotion of the ``who dat nation.'' as the 114th congress comes to a close, the senate will be losing an important member. david brings a sound, strategic mind to this chamber that will be missed. i wish him, wendy, their children, lise, sophie, airey, and jack, the best of luck in their journey forward. on behalf of all louisiana, i say thank you. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from louisiana. mr. vitter. mr. president, i thank the senator from louisiana for his very kind remarks. more importantly, i want to thank him for years of great partnership, great work on behalf of louisiana. i know he will make an outstanding senior senator. thank you. i yield the floor. mr. cassidy. mr. president, i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. ms. collins. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. ms. collins. mr. president, i rise in strong support of the 21st century cures act, and i commend the chairman and ranking member of the senate health, education, labor, and pensions committee, senator lamar alexander and senator patty murray, for their unwavering commitment to this very significant bipartisan legislation. the senate help committee, on which i am privileged to serve, has devoted considerable time and effort to this comprehensive legislation. it includes many reforms and priorities that will benefit so many families across our great country. the 21st century cures act will support the research and development of safe treatments and cures for millions of americans and their families who are coping with devastating diseases. it will improve the process of moving new discoveries from laboratory benches to patient bedsides. i doubt that there is a family in america who will not be touched by this important legislation in some way. all of us have a family member, a coworker, or a friend who has courageously faced the struggles of living with a debilitating chronic illness or a rare disease or who has received a devastating diagnosis and has passed away far too soon, leaving a hole in our hearts. imagine how this could change with the passage of the 21st century cures act and strong support of the research and development that will lead to new treatments and therapies that can help us achieve our dream of conquering so many devastating diseases. simply put, this legislation matters. it matters to the children who know firsthand the burden of living with type 1 diabetes and who beg their parents for just one day off--their birthday or christmas--from having to deal with the consequences of their juvenile diabetes. it matters to the family members who know the agonizing experience of looking into the eyes of a loved one suffering from alzheimer's disease, only to receive a confused look in return. it matters to the parents of young boys who have duchenne muscular dystrophy, who know what it is like to give their all in an effort to help their sons achieve their dreams, whether it is finishing college or driving a car, even as every day their children battle the progression of this debilitating and ultimately terminal illness. the 21st century cures act will drive progress in medical innovation so that we can prevail against these diseases and many more that cause so much pain and suffering, so much fear and uncertainty, and so much heartbreak. there simply is no investment that we can make that provides greater return for americans than our investment in biomedical research. it not only leads to new discoveries and the development of better treatments and even cures but also can have a dramatic effect on the budgets of families, states, and the federal government. the bill before us will help direct $4.8 billion to the national institutes of health, including $1.6 billion for the brain initiative to improve our understanding of diseases such as als, parkinson's, and alzheimer's, our nation's most costly disease. we spend $263 billion a year caring for people with alzheimer's disease. of that amount, approximately $160 billion comes from the medicare and medicaid programs. if the current trajectory continues as our population grows older, this disease will bankrupt the medicare and medicaid programs. that is why i am so pleased to see the brain initiative funded in this bill and also the work we are doing in the appropriations committee to boost funding for alzheimer's disease and other dementias so that we can finally find effective treatments, a means of prevention, or perhaps even a cure for this disease that brings so much heartache not only to those suffering from it but to their families as well. our bill will also help provide $1.8 billion for the vice president's cancer moonshot. we all know that vice president biden has taken on this cause--a very personal one for him--because he lost his beloved son beau to cancer. another exciting field that will be funded by this bill is $30 million for regenerative medicine, using adult stem [[page s6691]] cells. how exciting it was to have an individual come before our policy lunch whose sight had been restored due to innovative stem cell surgery. this individual lives in tennessee now but happens to be from presque isle, me, just 13 miles from where i was born and grew up. how i wish so many older people in this country who are losing their vision to macular degeneration and glaucoma--in some cases, a combination of both--or injuries to their eyes could benefit from this exciting development with adult stem cells, which has restored the sight of someone who was legally blind. he now can drive. that is so exciting, and that is the promise of researching regenerative medicine. in addition to support for nih, the 21st century cures act will help direct $1 billion in much needed funding to address the horrendous heroin and opioid abuse problem in this country. maine has been particularly hard hit by this epidemic. in just the first 9 months of this year, maine experienced a record 286 overdose deaths. that is more than one a day. tragically, that number already exceeds the 272 overdose deaths in maine during all of 2015. i am distressed when i hear about the lack of treatment options for mainers who are struggling with drug addiction, particularly in rural areas. as a result of the shortage of treatment alternatives, this epidemic is playing out in emergency rooms, county jails, and on the main streets of my state. i can't tell you how many sheriffs have come to me pleading for help, telling me that the intake area of their jail looks like a detox center or an emergency room of a hospital. they are overwhelmed by these cases. we can and must do more to support access to treatment and to alert people of all ages to the risks of opioid abuse and heroin use. the 21st century cures act will provide a vital infusion of $1 billion over 2 years to support grants to states to supplement treatment and prevention efforts. i was talking with one of my colleagues earlier today. both of us remember when we were in school hearing lectures from recovering heroin addicts who came into the schools, and i can state that it was highly effective. we would never have tried heroin. i can't even think of a proper analogy. we know, unfortunately, that many of the people who are using heroin started with prescription opioids, and that is why i am encouraged by movements across our country and by actions taken, at my request and the request of other senators, by the centers for medicare & medicaid services to make sure we are not putting pressure on providers to overprescribe opioids. surely they are appropriate in certain cases, but the number of prescriptions has soared in this country and is twice the number prescribed on a per capita basis as in our neighboring country of canada. the 21st century cures act also includes a bill that i introduced with several of my colleagues--senators warren, kirk, baldwin, alexander, and murray--that is called the advancing nih strategic planning and improving representation in medical research act. despite its extremely cumbersome name, it is an important bill that has been incorporated into this legislation. it will require the nih to release periodically a strategic plan outlining how the agency will meet its mission statement, and it will provide us with important guidance and metrics as we continue to work together to increase this vital funding. it will also help to ensure that study populations in clinical research are more representative of the diverse population in our country. for example, women face many of the same health threats as men, such as heart disease and cancer, but they react differently to various treatments. i remember years ago an infamous study that was called mrfit. it had only men enrolled in it. i believe, if memory serves me correctly, it was to look at heart disease. well, women often have different symptoms of heart disease than do men, and they respond differently to different medications, therapies, and treatments. we also know that women are at higher risk for certain chronic health conditions, such as alzheimer's disease and osteoporosis. they suffer from those diseases in far greater numbers than do men. with alzheimer's disease, i am wondering whether it is simply a matter that the biggest risk factor is age and women live longer than men, but perhaps there are other factors at play. my point is that by helping to ensure that women, african americans, latinos, and other demographic groups are appropriately represented in clinical research, we can increase our scientific understanding of the causes, risk factors, prevention strategies, and effects of treatments for diseases that commonly or disproportionately affect these populations. the bill before us also includes legislation that i introduced with my colleague from wisconsin, senator baldwin, to help address the educational debt burden that many young researchers face. this is so important to help ensure that america's finest, up-and-coming young researchers continue to help lead the world in biomedical discovery in this country. i don't want to lose these young talented people to other countries. i want them to stay right here. if they come to work for the nih or the cdc or other federally funded institutions and agencies and we can get them help with their medical school, college, their advanced degrees, and their debt, that is a very good agreement for us to be making. it is also of tremendous importance that we were able to add mental health legislation to the 21st century cures act. the reforms in this bill will enhance coordination, address a lack of resources, and develop real solutions to improve outcomes for individuals with serious mental illness and to help their families, who are often desperate to get them the help they need. i am pleased that the bill also includes the mental health on campus improvement act, which i offered as an amendment when we considered the mental health legislation in committee. my colleague, senator dick durbin, and i introduced this legislation for the first time in 2009. i commend him for his leadership. college students in maine and across the country must have access to critical and often lifesaving mental health services. despite growing demand for these critical services, far too many students still lack access. without these services, students may experience detrimental effects that range from declining academic performance to drug dependence and to being at greater risk of suicide. while millions of americans suffer from mental illness, only a statistical few engage in unspeakable acts of violence against themselves or others. suicide, however, is the leading cause of death among americans between the ages of 15 and 34. in addition, recent tragedies on college campuses, such as the shooting at a community college in roseburg, or, or at northern illinois university, highlight the dire need for mental health outreach and counseling services on college campuses. perhaps some of the tragedies that we have witnessed might have been prevented had the resources been in place to support timely diagnosis, early intervention, and effective treatment for those struggling with severe mental illness. one of the saddest meetings i have had in the last year was with a group of families from maine who had adult children who were suffering from severe mental illness, yet these families felt powerless in getting them the help they needed. these adult children were not compliant with the medication they had been prescribed, and in many cases their families felt powerless to be able to get them the help they needed. in one terrible case, a man's son was released from a hospital in the state of maine--from a hospital for people with mental illness--and he killed his mother, thinking she was al qaeda. only then could his father get his son the institutionalized help his son so desperately needed. it was just such a painful, painful story to hear from this anguished father and husband. i believe the language in this bill will help to change that. the 21st century cures act passed the house last week by an overwhelming vote of 392 to 26. think how few bills pass with that kind of strong, bipartisan support. it is supported by president obama, who had an op-ed in maine newspapers this weekend endorsing the bill. it is the product of years of bipartisan work on the senate help committee, and it has earned the support of more than 300 organizations. [[page s6692]] frankly, i am surprised that we are having a rollcall vote--a cloture vote on this bill. i am surprised because, while this bill may not be perfect--and no bill is--there is so much that is worthwhile, good, and significant in it that will make such a difference to so many american families. i urge all of our colleagues to vote in support of this bill so that we can quickly send it to the president's desk, where he is eager to sign it into law. it may well be the most important, far-reaching legislation that we pass this year in terms of its benefits for families across this great nation. mr. president, i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. tester. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. supporting our veterans mr. tester. mr. president, i rise today on behalf of nearly 100,000 veterans who live in montana. these are folks who have earned our deep respect and gratitude. i have traveled the state many times, listened to their ideas, and i have listened to their concerns. montana's veterans have not been shy about expressing their views. what i have heard is this. there is no doubt that we must hold the va accountable and work to improve access to health care, jobs, education, transportation, and housing for veterans. that is why it is critically important that we are taking marching orders from veterans and the advocacy organizations that are led by veterans, because we know that their top priority is to do right by the folks who they serve. veterans in montana also tell me that when it comes to solving the problems facing veterans, they expect folks in washington, dc, to check their politics at the door and go to work. unfortunately, there are groups out there that are funded by dark money. they hide their out-of-touch political agenda behind the veil of our nation's veterans. as the incoming ranking member of the veterans' affairs committee, i have serious concerns about who president-elect trump is listening to when it comes to honoring our veterans and this nation's commitment to those who have worn the uniform. that is why it is so troubling that recent news reports have indicated that the trump administration is relying heavily on guidance from concerned veterans for america. concerned veterans for america is a political advocacy group funded by the koch brothers, who want to dump unlimited amounts of dark money to push dangerous policies that would privatize the va or to convert the veterans health administration into an independent, nongovernment- chartered, for-profit corporation. cva also wants to divert funds from the va and cripple its ability to plan for the long term to recruit doctors and nurses and to invest in the information technology that can improve veterans' experiences at the va. these cuts will undermine the quality of care at the va. there is nothing wrong with helping veterans get specialty care in the community in a timely fashion when the va cannot do it. that often happens in rural communities, but cva's push for wholesale dismantling of the va is not what we want, and that is not what the veterans need. we need to talk to the veterans--the veterans i have spoken to--and this is what we will see. when folks volunteer to serve in the armed forces, this nation is indebted to them. we must ensure that we deliver on those promises that are made. privatizing the va will fail our veterans and their families. it will reduce the quality of care that our veterans receive, and it will be more expensive for taxpayers. privatizing the va will ultimately mean that veterans will wait longer for doctors' appointments and the cost of care will go up. all we have to do is take a look at the veterans choice program, which allows veterans to access care at private facilities. it has resulted in longer wait times, and this is unacceptable. under this program, veterans are actually waiting longer to see doctors. hospitals are increasingly frustrated and refusing to see veterans, and costs are going through the roof. imagine this program on steroids. that is what the cva wants to do--all while starving the va's existing workforce and infrastructure. in fact, what cva is pushing for is similar to what speaker ryan wants to do with medicare, and we have seen the backlash to that proposal by seniors across this nation. the same is true with the veterans and proposals to privatize the va. it is simply bad policy. groups such as the vfw, the american legion, disabled american veterans, iraq and afghanistan veterans of america, and many others oppose privatization, and they oppose it for good reason. the american legion national commander, dale barnett, said it best: the private sector didn't send our heroes to war. uncle sam did. barnett is right. the federal government has an obligation to honor those incredible sacrifices. when we shirk that responsibility, it dishonors those brave men and women. we need to listen to the american legion and countless other veterans groups, whose mission is to help the veterans, not unravel the va. veterans service organizations are very different and have a very different mission and tax structure than concerned veterans for america, the first being that vsos take their cues from the veterans they represent, not from billionaire political activists who fund their operation. groups such as the legion, the vfw, and iraq and afghanistan veterans of america are organized as nonprofit groups whose missions are simply to help veterans. concerned veterans for america is an issue advocacy group with a political mission. vsos disclose their donors. cva doesn't have to. yet cva has incredible influence and the ear of the president-elect. this is deeply concerning to me and, more importantly, it is deeply concerning to the veterans across this nation. i talk to veterans every week when i am home in montana. they universally tell me that they like the care they receive from the va once they get in the door; the problem is getting in the door. they don't want to see a private doc; they want to be seen by a va doc. they know that the va understands their unique issues. they know that doctors and nurses at the va are attentive to the wounds of war. my hope is that president-elect donald trump starts talking with the folks who want to help veterans and not to organizations with a political agenda. my hope is that he will work with chairman isakson and me and countless other reputable veterans groups to hold the va accountable while increasing access to care. my hope is that he will work with democrats, republicans, and independents to reform our campaign finance laws so that we can increase transparency and know who is trying to influence this government. my hope is that he will put veterans first as he chooses the next va secretary. i remain hopeful that we can find common ground to work together to hold the va accountable, to improve care, and to ensure that we are all delivering for veterans. when our brothers and sisters and sons and daughters are sent to war, we make promises to them--promises we must keep. when they come home, they are changed people, and we cannot expect the private sector to address these seen and unseen wounds of war. in this upcoming congress, there will be incredible opportunities to make progress, and i am fully committed to montana's veterans and veterans across this country and their families, and i will push back against those who attempt to undermine the noble mission of the veterans' administration. mr. president, i yield the floor. mrs. feinstein. mr. president, i wish to support the 21st century cures act, which would make vital investments in research to develop new treatments for deadly diseases, including cancer. the bill would also dedicate desperately needed funding to address some of our country's most pressing public health problems--opioid addiction and mental illness. first, i would like to speak about the bill's provisions for cancer and rare diseases. cancer touches the lives of all americans; it doesn't discriminate. we [[page s6693]] have all experienced the grief and pain that comes with losing a loved one, friend, or colleague to this terrible disease. cancer is the second leading cause of death in our country. nearly 40 percent of americans will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lives, according to the national cancer institute. we have made great strides in improving detection, treatment, and survival rates for many cancers, including early-stage breast cancer, prostate cancer, and melanoma. despite this progress, other cancers like pancreatic and certain brain cancers remain extremely deadly, with very low 5-year survival rates. these cancers are typically detected in late stages, and even the most cutting-edge treatments may result in just a few more months of life. the cures act designates nearly $4.8 billion in additional funds for medical research through the national institutes of health, $1.8 billion of which will expand and accelerate cancer research, in line with vice president biden's cancer moonshot initiative. this research funding also supports important initiatives focused on precision medicine and neurological research. next, i would like to talk about the bill's funding to combat opioid addiction, which is an epidemic in this country. nearly 2 million americans are addicted to opioids, and 19,000 americans overdosed and died in 2014. this epidemic stems from a surge in the use of prescription drugs. it is not a coincidence that prescription overdose deaths quadrupled during the same period that opioid prescriptions quadrupled. in 2012, 259 million prescriptions for opioids were written. that means 80 percent of americans could have a bottle of pills. prescription drug abuse frequently leads to heroin addiction because these drugs affect the brain in the same way. this problem is exacerbated because heroin is significantly cheaper that prescription opioids like oxycontin or fentanyl. this crisis demands an immediate, comprehensive, national response. congress took a first step earlier this year, passing the comprehensive addiction and recovery act in may. this bill authorizes grants to expand access to substance use disorder treatment, strengthen prescription drug monitoring programs, and supply first responders with naloxone, which can reverse the effects of an overdose. however, this bill didn't include any funding for the initiatives it authorized. the cures act takes that step, providing $1 billion for the department of health and human services to fund many of the prevention and treatment programs authorized by congress earlier this year. lastly, i would like to highlight the bill's provisions to improve our country's mental health system. this is an area where we fall far short. we don't do nearly enough to ensure those with mental illness are able to access appropriate treatment and this has ripple effects throughout society. in october, i was briefed on the homelessness crisis in los angeles and toured a shelter for homeless women. a significant percentage of the city's homeless population is battling mental illness. so, by improving our mental health system, we are also going to address connected issues like homelessness. under the bill, health and human services will develop a strategic plan to address mental health priorities. there is increased funding to train our doctors and nurses to better integrate substance abuse and mental health treatment into primary care visits. the bill also reauthorizes many important existing programs, including the national suicide prevention lifeline and the national child traumatic stress network, and increases support for mental health and drug courts. these innovative approaches to criminal justice provide an alternative process for individuals to receive and comply with needed treatment and are supported by the law enforcement community. the bill further provides for police training when police officers encounter individuals who exhibit mental illness. i recently convened meetings in los angeles and san francisco with law enforcement and community leaders, and they all stressed the importance of deescalating situations with mentally ill individuals to make sure that situations do not end with violent encounters. in closing, i reiterate my support for the 21 century cures act and urge its swift passage. this is a great opportunity to spur this century's medical innovation, improve access to needed treatments, and strengthen public health. the presiding officer (mr. coats). the senator from tennessee. mr. alexander. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that senator kirk be recognized next and then senator murphy following him and that after that, i be recognized. we will be voting at 5:30. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. the senator from illinois. mr. kirk. mr. president, 4 years ago i climbed the capitol steps for those who could not. i vowed to return to the senate to create and establish a standard of care for rehabilitation in this legislation to make sure many people can have access to the best rehab, as i did. with the passage of the cures act tomorrow, we will achieve this lofty goal. the cures act also contains bipartisan provisions to provide accelerated approval of regenerative medicines and therapies. the regrow act, which is also in this bill, is a major step forward so that americans will not have to go to other countries for their own stem cells to be used in their own therapy. making sure this faster approval process happens in this bill means that many more people will be able to receive advanced stem cell therapies that are also available overseas, right here at home. i would like to thank everybody. we have made progress with the fda. i championed with senators collins and manchin on this. i thank my senior colleague from tennessee for all of his action on the regrow act so we can make the fundamental point of using your own stem cells to accelerate healing. in the case of using your own stem cells, they already have your exact dna match. i think it is wise that we go through a shorter process. i thank the senator for putting the kirk language in the regrow act. i yield the floor. mr. alexander. mr. president, while we are waiting for senator murphy, let me salute senator kirk for his leadership from the very beginning. he has pointed out to the committee and the senate that, as the mayo clinic has said, regenerative medicine is a game changer for stroke victims, for heart disease, and for people with retinal disease. thanks to senator kirk, senator collins, senator manchin, and senator mcconnell, we have legislation that takes an important and responsible step forward to recognize the promise of regenerative medicine. this bill includes $30 million to the national institutes of health for clinical trials to support regenerative medicine. then there are two other provisions in the bill. one of them allows the food and drug administration to make regenerative therapeutic products eligible for the fda's existing accelerated drug approval pathway. we have had great success over the last 4 or 5 years with an accelerated pathway for drugs, similar to what senators burr and bennet and others got enacted into law. we are doing the same thing with combination drugs and devices in this legislation. now senator kirk has added regenerative medicine to the accelerated pathway, and i salute him for that leadership. the presiding officer. the senator from illinois. mr. kirk. mr. president, i wish to remind my colleague, who is also the chairman of the appropriations energy subcommittee that controls the exascale funding, one of the most complicated things we can face in our world is biological systems when we look at the new aurora computer that is going to be built in the argonne national laboratories. i know that at oak ridge, we have exascale computers. my goal is to make sure we are always way ahead of the chinese. in the case of aurora, we now have $165 million to make sure that we have a computer that is far faster than the computer in china. with that, we will be able to model proteins themselves to make sure we make these advances much faster. my hope is that we will be [[page s6694]] stunned at how much biological work is being done at the oak ridge lab with their leading computer to make sure we accelerate progress on this. let me say one thing about the work of the senator. every piece of legislation that he touches goes through by a couple hundred votes. when we see lamar take over a bill, we know it is going to be going through on a big walloping. he got a huge vote in the senate, and i hope he gets a big vote again. everything he touches turns to gold, and we cannot have a better friend in medical care than we have in lamar alexander. mr. alexander. mr. president, the senator from illinois is very generous, and i thank him, but i would remind him that he was the persistent agent for the change in support for regenerative medicine. that wasn't easy to do, and he has been the leader, along with others of us who cared about the same thing, in making sure the united states maintains its lead in supercomputing competition around the world. senator murphy, the senator from connecticut, is coming. i think what i will do is begin, and when he comes i will stop and let him make his 5 minutes of remarks and then resume so i don't delay the vote because i know everyone is looking forward to casting a great big ``yes'' vote in a few minutes. the u.s. senate majority leader, whose position in the senate this is, has said more than once in private meetings i attended and on the floor of this body that the 21st century cures bill on which we will be voting in a few minutes is the most important legislation congress will pass this year. in his address to the nation this past weekend, president obama urged us to vote for the bill today and tomorrow. ``it could help us find a cure for alzheimer's,'' the president said. ``it could end cancer as we know it and help those seeking treatment for opioid addiction.'' the president continued: ``it's an opportunity to save lives and an opportunity we just can't miss.'' vice president biden has been telephoning senators urging support for 21st century cures because, in the vice president's words, it is a big step for cancer research and the cancer moonshot that is so close to his heart. speaker paul ryan in the house of representatives has made 21st century cures explicitly a centerpiece of his vision for our country's future, describing it as ``bipartisan legislation that would accelerate the discovery, development, and delivery of lifesaving treatments.'' with such bipartisan support from the president of the united states, the vice president of the united states, the speaker of the house, the senate majority leader--two democrats, two republicans--it is no wonder that on last wednesday, the house of representatives approved 21st century cures by the overwhelming vote of 392 to 26. this legislation holds the promise of improving the life and health of virtually every family in the country. it will provide $4.8 billion in a one-time surge of funding for biomedical research in a time of breathtaking opportunity. it will advance vice president biden's cancer moonshot to find cures for cancer and president obama's precision medicine initiative, as well as the brain initiative. it will help move safe and effective treatments and cures through the development and regulatory process more rapidly, and it will lower costs, making medicines available sooner and hopefully also at lower costs to patients. it will provide $1 billion in grants to help deal with the raging opioid epidemic. it includes legislation to help the one in five adults in this country suffering from a mental illness, help them receive treatment by updating many of our country's mental health programs for the first time in a decade. it will improve health information technology for doctors who are eager to get rid of the overdocumentation of hospitals and their patients and help get the nation's electronic health records system out of the ditch. from a taxpayer's point of view, it does all of these things in a fiscally responsible way by reducing other spending to pay for every penny of the $6.3 billion cost. i see the senator from connecticut on the floor, so i would like to suspend my remarks for 5 minutes so that he can make his, and then i would ask unanimous consent that the totality of my remarks follow his remarks. before he speaks, let me just say once again how much i appreciate his leadership and that of senator cassidy and senator cornyn. one reason the majority leader calls this the most important piece of legislation congress will act on this year is because it includes the mental health legislation that these senators, including senator murphy, senator cornyn, and senator cassidy, have offered. the presiding officer. the senator from connecticut. mr. murphy. mr. president, i appreciate senator alexander's kindness in allowing me to say a few words in support of this bill on behalf of myself and senator murray. i wish to congratulate senator alexander for once again showing how the senate can work properly, how we can bring together republicans and democrats for a priority that really has nothing to do with whether one is a republican or a democrat or whether one voted for hillary clinton or donald trump. if people are out there suffering from a life-altering or potentially terminal disease or suffering from mental illness or addiction, they need help, and we are coming together in maybe one of the most important pieces of health legislation that has passed this congress in a very long time to deliver that help. so i am not going to endeavor to recreate the remarks of senator alexander when it comes to describing the important aspects of this bill except to say that after passage of this bill, it is going to be a whole heck of a lot more likely that a life-changing, lifesaving drug is going to be able to make it to market in time to save a life. every single one of the underlying reforms in this bill to the drug discovery process is bipartisan. i think about senators bennet and hatch's bill, the promise for antibiotics and therapeutics for health, which establishes a new pathway for antibacterial and antifungal drugs that will treat serious, life-threatening infections for patients. i think about senator casey and senator isakson working on the advancing hope act, which will extend the pediatric priority review voucher program until 2020. it incentivizes drug companies to research treatment for life-altering diseases that impact pediatric patients. inside this bill are all sorts of good, important, bipartisan achievements. as senator alexander noted, there is also help on the way for people suffering from addiction. in my tiny little state--only 1 percent of the nation's population--we are going to have over 800 people die this year from drug overdoses. yes, we need to get to the source of that epidemic and stop people from getting addicted to pain medications in the first place, but, boy, we have an awful lot of people showing up with overdoses in our emergency rooms who have no place to go, have no detox programs, no long-term residential programs. the $1 billion authorized in this legislation to fight the opioid epidemic is going to save lives in my little state. finally, when it comes to the issue of mental health--senator alexander, senator cassidy, and i were on the floor last week talking about this legislation; the focus on funding prevention, the focus on making sure parents are part of the care for their adult children, the focus on ensuring that insurance companies really do pay attention to the parity act we passed 10 years ago in this congress to assure that you get covered for mental illness just like physical illness. a broken leg really isn't any different than a broken brain when we think about it. we can treat both. these are important advances in mental health as well. i know this place has a bad reputation; that people pay attention to the fights here more often than they do to the moments where we get together and cooperate. the 21st century cures act that senator murray and senator alexander, with help from senator cornyn, me, senator cassidy, and in the house congressmen upton, pallone, tim murphy, and eddie bernice johnson--this is an example of how this place can work better. as we head in to what may be a very charged atmosphere in january, i hope we remember this moment. i wanted to [[page s6695]] come down on behalf of senator murray, who has helped shepherd this process, to congratulate senator alexander on it and recommend its passage to all of my colleagues. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from tennessee. mr. alexander. mr. president, i thank the senator for his words, support, and his leadership this year. i thank also senator murray from washington. she would be here, except her plane is delayed. the vote will be held open to make sure she can be here, but senator murray is a member of the democratic leadership and well respected on that side of the aisle but also on this side of the aisle because, when she can, she creates an environment where we can do today exactly what we are doing today. i think the american people appreciate that, and senator murphy and i both benefit from that. i thank the senator for those remarks and will now continue my remarks. at a senate hearing earlier this year, dr. francis collins, the distinguished head of the national institutes of health--an agency he calls the ``national institutes of hope''--offered ``bold predictions'' about major advances to expect in the next 10 years from sustained investments in biomedical research, such as we are doing with this bill. one prediction is that scientists will find ways to identify individuals at risk for alzheimer's even before symptoms appear, as well as how to slow or even prevent the disease. today, alzheimer's causes untold family grief and costs $236 billion a year. left unchecked, the cost in 2050 would be more than our nation spends on national defense. dr. collins' other predictions are equally breathtaking. using stem cells, doctors could use a patient's own cells to rebuild his or her heart. this personalized rebuilt heart, dr. collins says, would make transplant waiting lists and anti-rejection drugs obsolete. he expects development of an artificial pancreas to help diabetes patients by tracking blood glucose levels and creating precise doses of insulin. he says a zika vaccine should be widely available by 2018, with universal flu vaccine and hiv/aids vaccine available within the decade. to relieve suffering and deal with the epidemic of opioid addiction that led to 28,000 overdose deaths in america in 2014, he predicts new nonaddictive medicines to manage pain, an even more effective antidote than the $1 billion we would be authorizing by our votes today. these truly would be miracles. the bill has taken more than 2 years to assemble both in the senate and the house. there have been major differences of opinion, but the resolution of those differences--thanks to senator murray and many other senators--has been bipartisan every step of the way. we saw that on display in the work of the president, the vice president, the speaker of the house, and the senate majority leader. we saw it in the house with its vote of 392 to 26 last week, thanks especially to the leadership of chairman upton, ranking member pallone, and representative degette. we saw it in our senate health committee, where we approved 19 bills that include 50 proposals, and every one with both a democratic and republican sponsor, except for 1 bill offered solely by senator murray, who is the ranking democratic member of our committee. we have a diverse committee of 22 members--that would be an understatement, actually--some of the most liberal members and some of the most conservative members, but when our committee considered these 19 bills during our 3 markups held over several months, the largest number of votes against any one of these 19 bipartisan bills was 2. let me say that again. the largest number of votes--recorded votes--against any one of these 19 bipartisan bills was 2 in our committee of 22. here is what some of those 19 bipartisan bills--again, approved unanimously or by a wide margin--would do to help move safe and effective treatments and cures more rapidly through the regulatory process and into patients' medicine cabinets and into doctors' offices. for example, senators bennet, warren, burr, and hatch's act would allow researchers to use their own data from previously approved therapies when they submit for review a treatment or cure for serious rare genetic diseases, like duchenne's, a rare kind of muscular dystrophy that could impact children as young as 3. senators burr and franken's legislation will help to bring innovative medical devices--such as artificial knees, insulin pumps, and heart stents--to patients more quickly by getting rid of unnecessary burdens in medical device evaluations and streamlining the review process for clinical trials. senators baldwin and collins have a bill to improve opportunities for our young researchers, essential to advancing biomedical research. senator kirk just talked about his legislation with bennet, hatch, murkowski, isakson, and collins to improve rehabilitation research and help the approximately 800,000 americans who suffer a stroke each year. senators isakson, murphy, casey, wicker, and vitter will help advance our understanding of neurological diseases. senator murray, as i mentioned earlier, will clarify that the fda requires cleaning and validation data for reusable medical devices. senators murray, hatch, bennet, cassidy and whitehouse's bill will improve health information technology for doctors and their patients. we had six hearings on medical information technology programs in a ditch. we think we are helping to get them out of the ditch. we have been working with the obama administration to do that, and i look forward to working with the trump administration to continue that. senators burr, bennet, hatch, and donnelly would speed safe breakthrough devices, putting senior people in charge of the review process. casey, isakson, brown, and kirk's legislation. if you are the parent of a child with a rare disease like brain cancer, their bill would increase the likelihood that your child will be able to take a drug that will help by giving a drug company that develops a drug for such a disease a voucher they could keep or sell that would speed up the review of another drug. one may say this is getting boring. this is too long. it is not boring to the millions of americans who stand to benefit from this, and it is exactly the kind of work we ought to be doing in the united states senate and what the american people would like to see us do more of. the medical electronic data technology enhancement act, with senators bennet and hatch and many others interested in that. senators burr and casey and isakson and roberts have important legislation for planning ahead for events like bioterror attacks, to help protect against anthrax, for example, or smallpox. the combination products innovation act, with a number of senators involved on the committee, will help prevent the growing field of combination products--like bandaids with neosporin built in or a heart stent that can be implanted to deliver blood thinners to prevent clots--from being caught in redtape. then there is legislation that will give patients and their families a voice in drug development. there is one that is a top priority for the heads of fda and nih which will help those agencies attract and keep the kind of talent they need to approve all these exciting advances that are coming. there is legislation to shorten the development of new treatments to help those affected with life-threatening superbugs. the advancing precision medicine act, which senator murray and i cosponsored, is in direct support of president obama's initiative to map 1 million genomes so researchers can develop treatments and cures tailored to a patient's genome. there are five or six other major pieces of legislation that i will include in the record but not read at this time because we are approaching the time for a vote, but let me conclude by saying that in addition to these bipartisan policies, the 21st century cures bill includes $6.3 billion in funding. we usually don't attach such funding to a bill authorizing programs. we usually work [[page s6696]] along two tracks; one track for authorizing programs and one deciding how much to spend on those programs. during the last 2 years, while we have been working on our authorizing legislation, our appropriations committees have recommended major increases in support for biomedical research, and it is important that every senator know this. in the current year, at the urging of senators blunt and senator murray, congress added $2 billion a year to the $32 billion budget of the national institutes of health, which could total $20 billion over 10 years. then, the senate appropriations committee recommended another $2 billion increase for the next fiscal year, 2017, which could total another $20 billion over 10 years. this 21st century cures legislation adds $4.8 billion in a surge of one-time spending for the national institutes of health on top of the regular appropriated money toward key objectives: $1.8 billion for the cancer moonshot, $1.4 billion for precision medicine, $1.6 for the brain initiative, and it adds $1 billion for state grants to help states fight the opioid abuse epidemic. i believe that for every state represented by a senator here tonight, the opioid epidemic is on the front pages of the newspapers. it adds $500 million for the food and drug administration, and 21st century cures also gives the national institutes of health $30 million for clinical trials to support regenerative medicine, which the mayo clinic has described as a ``game- changing area of medicine with the potential to fully heal damaged tissues and organs, offering solutions and hope for people who have conditions that are beyond repair.'' it gives the fda authority to allow regenerative therapeutic products to be eligible for fda's existing accelerated drug approval pathway. i wish to acknowledge the work of speaker ryan and leader mcconnell in designing a way to secure funding that both democrats and republicans can accept. that is not always easy. for those concerned about additional spending--often on our side of the aisle--speaker ryan and house budget chairman tom price made sure the funding is one time, not mandatory, paid for, and approved each year by appropriations committees. it doesn't add one penny to the overall budget because for every increase in the discretionary budget, we reduce the same amount in the mandatory ledger. for those who worry that congress might not approve the $6.3 billion in additional spending in later years--i have heard a little of that from the other side of the aisle--my answer is that the best way to ensure the money is spent in the following years is a big vote today and tomorrow when we finally pass the bill, just as the house did last week. in conclusion, it will be hard to explain why you voted to spend $6.3 billion for cancer, the precision medicine initiative, and opioids this year but then voted not to spend it next year, and the legislation provides that the money cannot be diverted for any other purpose than what we vote for today and tomorrow. in addition, this year's portion of cures funding--including one-half billion for opioid grants--is included in the continuing resolution that we will vote on later this week. this is the kind of lasting legacy the president of the united states and our congress can be proud of. the next administration or the next congress will not be repealing this law because we have taken the time to work out our differences and create a consensus of support. we did this at this time last year with an equally complicated bill to fix no child left behind, which, despite its complexities, received 85 votes in this body. when he signed it, the president called it a ``christmas miracle.'' the 21st century cures bill will present president obama with another christmas miracle, one that will help virtually every family. when we pass this legislation, the real winners will be the american families whose lives will be improved by this bipartisan legislation. mr. president, i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. whitehouse. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. whitehouse. mr. president, with the permission of my distinguished chairman, who has worked very hard on this bill and whose efforts i appreciate very much, i wanted to add, very briefly, that i hope very much and look forward to working with my colleagues to assure that the second tranche of the opioid funding is aligned with the cara bill, or the comprehensive addiction and recovery act, which we just passed in such bipartisan fashion a few months ago. we have not achieved that alignment yet, and i hope that we do very soon. i appreciate the terrific efforts of my chairman. with that, i yield. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. mcconnell. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the vice president. without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",84645
CREC-2016-12-05-pt1-PgS6696,CREC-2016-12-05,114,DIRECTING THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO MAKE A CORRECTION IN THE ENROLLMENT OF H.R. 34,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6696-S6697] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DIRECTING THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO MAKE A CORRECTION IN THE ENROLLMENT OF H.R. 34 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is a rare day when we see the Vice President presiding. We welcome him here today. We look forward to welcoming him back later in the week. I know Members will have plenty to say about his life and his legacy later in the week, but today the Senate would like to specifically acknowledge his efforts to help Americans struggling with cancer. He has known the cruel toll this disease can take, but he hasn't let it defeat him. He has chosen to fight back. He has taken a leading role, and the Senate will soon pass the 21st Century Cures Act as a testament to his tremendous effort. I think it is fitting to dedicate this bill's critical cancer initiatives in honor of someone who would be proud of the Presiding Officer today, and that is his son Beau. In just a moment, that is exactly what the Senate will do--renaming the NIH's cancer initiatives in this bill after Beau Biden. Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a brief statement? Mr. McCONNELL. If I could say to my friend the Democratic leader, I have one more thing here. Therefore, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of H. Con. Res. 174, which is at the desk. The VICE PRESIDENT. The clerk will report the concurrent resolution by title. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: A concurrent resolution (H. Con.

Without objection, it is so ordered. DACA Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last Friday I had a meeting in Chicago with about 50 in attendance. It was Friday morning, and we gathered groups of people from across the city of Chicago and the State of Illinois who were focusing on one make-or-break issue for many of us. It was an emotional issue, one that caused many to break down in tears as they told me their stories. It is the reason I have come back to the floor of the Senate today and every day since the election to talk about one specific issue that I believe is important for this Nation to reflect on. Mr. President, 16 years ago a young lady contacted my office. Her name is Tereza Lee. She had been brought to the United States from Korea at the age of 2. She had grown up in Chicago with a family of modest means. During the course of her childhood, she signed up for what is known as the Merit music program in Chicago. They offered free instruments and free musical instruction to kids from low-income families. It is a great program. Tereza Lee signed up, and it turned out she had an extraordinary talent at piano. When she came to contact my office, it was as she was leaving high school and applying to be accepted at the best music schools in the America--Juilliard in New York and the Conservatory of Music in Manhattan. She went to fill out the application, and when it came to a question of her citizenship and nationality, she wasn't certain what to put. Her mother suggested that she call our office, and she did. We told her that under the law she was undocumented, brought here at the age of 2 on a visitor visa. Her mother had never filed any papers for her. She had grown up in America thinking she was an American citizen like her brother and sister who were born here, and she came to realize at the age of 17 or 18 that in the eyes of the law she had no legal standing in America. The law is pretty harsh for people like Tereza. The law says she needs to leave the United States for 10 years and apply to return to the United States. Where would she go--to Korea? She had never been there. She grew up in Brazil for a short period of time. She didn't speak the language. She doesn't speak Portuguese. She was caught in the middle. That is why I introduced the DREAM Act. It said that young people brought to the United States by their parents before the age of 16, if they finish school and have no serious criminal issues, should be given a chance to go to school further and have a legal status in America and, ultimately, to earn their way to citizenship--going to the back of the line and waiting their turn but at least setting that as their goal. I introduced that bill 15 years ago. It has never become law, but there are 2.5 million people in that circumstance in America. Six years ago, the President of the United States created something called DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, by an Executive action. As a result of that action, President Obama allowed these eligible DREAMers--as they have come to be known--to receive DACA status. In order to do it, they have to apply, come out of the shadows, declare themselves, file a fee of about $500 with the government, go through a criminal background check, and then be given temporary--only temporary--legal status so they can't be deported and can [[Page S6698]] legally work, which is renewable every 2 years. As of today, 744,000 young people have done that. Many of them were in the room--at least some of them were in the room in Chicago last Friday. They are not certain what is going to happen next. The new President has promised to end DACA. If he ends it, what happens to these young people? For instance, there are 28 of these DACA young people who are in medical school at Loyola University in Chicago--28 students who are undocumented who are there without any Federal Government assistance, and most of them have promised to give a year of service to the State of Illinois in rural areas and poor neighborhoods when they become doctors. If they lose their DACA status, they lose their ability to work legally in the United States and they cannot go through the clinical experience, which is part of becoming a doctor. They would have to drop out of medical school. There is one thing we can say for certain: We don't have an oversupply of doctors serving inner cities and rural areas in my State and across the Nation. We need these doctors. If DACA changes, if it is eliminated, what will happen to these young people? That is a challenge which I face, and other Members have as well. I salute Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. He is working with me on legislation to address this, to at least give a temporary status to these DACA-eligible young people while we debate immigration reform in a larger context. There are important issues at stake, but the most fundamental issue is one of fairness and justice. These young people did nothing wrong. They were brought to this country by their parents. They have grown up in this country, gone to our schools, and there are some amazing stories of what they have done with their lives. I wish to tell you one of those stories. I have done this over 100 times now on the floor of the Senate. This is Barbara Olachea. In 2002, when Barbara was 5 years old, her family brought her to the United States from Mexico. She grew up in Phoenix, AZ, and she knew she would face challenges, being undocumented. Her older sister had been accepted to Arizona State University but couldn't afford to go to school there. As an undocumented immigrant, she is not eligible for Federal financial assistance. Arizona law specifically prohibits State financial assistance to DREAMers such as Barbara and her sister. During her freshman year in high school, a mentor told her that as a DREAMer, ``You're going to have to try harder than everybody else.'' Barbara said: Those words confirmed what I had known all along. Although I was only starting high school, I began to dread what most students anticipate with excitement: graduation day. What if I got into my dream school, but I still couldn't go because I couldn't afford it? In high school, Barbara was a great student and was involved in many extracurricular and volunteer activities. She was a member of the Academic Decathlon team for 4 years and team captain when she was a senior. She was a member of student government, yearbook, and homecoming. She volunteered to tutor middle school students and worked part time to save money for her education. She participated in a number of programs at Arizona State University, including the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism. She recorded a story about her life that was aired on National Public Radio. This experience sparked her interest in journalism and led to an internship at KJZZ, the Phoenix affiliate for NPR. Last year Barbara graduated as valedictorian of her high school class with a 4.5 grade point average. As a result of her accomplishments, Barbara was accepted at Dartmouth College, an Ivy League school, where she is now a sophomore. Barbara wrote a letter to me and said this about DACA: I am very grateful for DACA, as it allowed me to work and not be deported to a country I do not know and have not been to since I was five. Just like thousands of other undocumented students in the United States, I have grown up and become accustomed to the culture here. The U.S. is where I belong and I want to be a contributing member of society, as I have proved in my 13 years here. Barbara and other DREAMers have so much to give. They are young, they are idealistic, they are energetic, and they are amazing. These young people have overcome odds that many young people never face in their lives. To think that in your freshman year of high school, you are reflecting on the fact that even if accepted to college, you may not be able to go--that was her future as she saw it then. If DACA is eliminated, Barbara will lose her legal status and could be deported to Mexico--a country where she hasn't lived since she was 5. Will America be a better country if Barbara is deported or if she stays here and uses her talent, her determination, her energy, and her inspiration, for our future? I think the answer is clear. Now is the time for America, this Nation of immigrants, to come together and heal the wounds that divided us in this election. I am just hoping that this President-elect, when he reflects on Barbara and 700,000-plus other DACA eligibles, will realize that they can bring important values and achievements to America's future. I am hoping that in the Senate, we can overcome our differences--and there are many deep differences, political differences--and give these young people a chance. Senator Graham and I are basically working on a bill that says at least suspend their status so they won't be deported, so they can continue to work. Do that while we do our business here on the issue of immigration. That is only fair. It is only right. It is the right American way to approach an issue that can affect so many innocent American people. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia. Miners Protection Act Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an issue of great urgency--the fate of tens of thousands of American workers. In just a matter of weeks, 16,000 coal miners and their dependents will lose their health care coverage and roughly 6,000 others will join that group in the year 2017, and here we are just days away from Congress wrapping up its work for the year. This should be a time to motivate us to action. I have served in Congress a long time, and I know nothing motivates Congress more than a deadline, being up against a deadline, as we are today. This time should be no different, and here is why: Without some resolution before Congress adjourns, the men and women who have powered our Nation and spurred economic growth for generations will have the carpet ripped out from under them. They will lose the health care benefits they so rely on and have been promised. It is important to recognize the risks our coal miners take to better our lives every day. When you visit a coal mine, which I have done--I have been underground in a coal mine--you see the rigorous and often very dangerous working conditions where these men and women do their job every day to provide the energy we need to light this Chamber, to warm our homes, and to keep our classrooms lit. These miners are the pillars of our communities, and many of them are veterans of our Nation. For decades they have worked hard and played by the rules. Yet the realities facing these men and women are stark. They are up against the wall, and we are up against the wall with them. The challenges they face will only grow if we fail to accommodate and have immediate action. We can talk about the realities of the War on Coal, but this is about more than that. This is about people--tens of thousands of people, mostly older, many suffering health issues--who rely on health care, and many are in need. This is about tens of thousands of coal jobs that have been lost, devastating my region of the country, forcing miners to rely on these modest benefits more than ever before. This is about employers who are bankrupt who can no longer fund these benefit plans. We have a solution right here in front of us that is ready for a vote to prevent any lapse in benefits. It is a solution that has support from both sides of the aisle. We passed the Miners Protection Act out of the Finance Committee in a bipartisan way, and it is a solution that could make a difference in the livelihoods of tens of thousands of Americans. I had really hoped that we could offer the Miners Protection Act as an amendment to the 21st Century Cures [[Page S6699]] bill. The 21st Century Cures bill is all about health. The Miners Protection Act is a lot about the health and well-being of our miners. That is why, despite the many good things and benefits in the 21st Century Cures Act, such as funding for the opioid epidemic that hit my State of West Virginia and many of our States very hard, advanced medicine, and Cancer Moonshot, I had to oppose us moving forward on the Cures Act tonight without an amendment process. That is how important this issue is to our miners. Before Friday we will move forward on a bill to fund our government. We must take action in that bill--which I consider mostly our last chance, the continuing resolution--to protect these important benefits for our miners.

Without objection, it is so ordered. DACA Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last Friday I had a meeting in Chicago with about 50 in attendance. It was Friday morning, and we gathered groups of people from across the city of Chicago and the State of Illinois who were focusing on one make-or-break issue for many of us. It was an emotional issue, one that caused many to break down in tears as they told me their stories. It is the reason I have come back to the floor of the Senate today and every day since the election to talk about one specific issue that I believe is important for this Nation to reflect on. Mr. President, 16 years ago a young lady contacted my office. Her name is Tereza Lee. She had been brought to the United States from Korea at the age of 2. She had grown up in Chicago with a family of modest means. During the course of her childhood, she signed up for what is known as the Merit music program in Chicago. They offered free instruments and free musical instruction to kids from low-income families. It is a great program. Tereza Lee signed up, and it turned out she had an extraordinary talent at piano. When she came to contact my office, it was as she was leaving high school and applying to be accepted at the best music schools in the America--Juilliard in New York and the Conservatory of Music in Manhattan. She went to fill out the application, and when it came to a question of her citizenship and nationality, she wasn't certain what to put. Her mother suggested that she call our office, and she did. We told her that under the law she was undocumented, brought here at the age of 2 on a visitor visa. Her mother had never filed any papers for her. She had grown up in America thinking she was an American citizen like her brother and sister who were born here, and she came to realize at the age of 17 or 18 that in the eyes of the law she had no legal standing in America. The law is pretty harsh for people like Tereza. The law says she needs to leave the United States for 10 years and apply to return to the United States. Where would she go--to Korea? She had never been there. She grew up in Brazil for a short period of time. She didn't speak the language. She doesn't speak Portuguese. She was caught in the middle. That is why I introduced the DREAM Act. It said that young people brought to the United States by their parents before the age of 16, if they finish school and have no serious criminal issues, should be given a chance to go to school further and have a legal status in America and, ultimately, to earn their way to citizenship--going to the back of the line and waiting their turn but at least setting that as their goal. I introduced that bill 15 years ago. It has never become law, but there are 2.5 million people in that circumstance in America. Six years ago, the President of the United States created something called DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, by an Executive action. As a result of that action, President Obama allowed these eligible DREAMers--as they have come to be known--to receive DACA status. In order to do it, they have to apply, come out of the shadows, declare themselves, file a fee of about $500 with the government, go through a criminal background check, and then be given temporary--only temporary--legal status so they can't be deported and can [[Page S6698]] legally work, which is renewable every 2 years. As of today, 744,000 young people have done that. Many of them were in the room--at least some of them were in the room in Chicago last Friday. They are not certain what is going to happen next. The new President has promised to end DACA. If he ends it, what happens to these young people? For instance, there are 28 of these DACA young people who are in medical school at Loyola University in Chicago--28 students who are undocumented who are there without any Federal Government assistance, and most of them have promised to give a year of service to the State of Illinois in rural areas and poor neighborhoods when they become doctors. If they lose their DACA status, they lose their ability to work legally in the United States and they cannot go through the clinical experience, which is part of becoming a doctor. They would have to drop out of medical school. There is one thing we can say for certain: We don't have an oversupply of doctors serving inner cities and rural areas in my State and across the Nation. We need these doctors. If DACA changes, if it is eliminated, what will happen to these young people? That is a challenge which I face, and other Members have as well. I salute Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. He is working with me on legislation to address this, to at least give a temporary status to these DACA-eligible young people while we debate immigration reform in a larger context. There are important issues at stake, but the most fundamental issue is one of fairness and justice. These young people did nothing wrong. They were brought to this country by their parents. They have grown up in this country, gone to our schools, and there are some amazing stories of what they have done with their lives. I wish to tell you one of those stories. I have done this over 100 times now on the floor of the Senate. This is Barbara Olachea. In 2002, when Barbara was 5 years old, her family brought her to the United States from Mexico. She grew up in Phoenix, AZ, and she knew she would face challenges, being undocumented. Her older sister had been accepted to Arizona State University but couldn't afford to go to school there. As an undocumented immigrant, she is not eligible for Federal financial assistance. Arizona law specifically prohibits State financial assistance to DREAMers such as Barbara and her sister. During her freshman year in high school, a mentor told her that as a DREAMer, ``You're going to have to try harder than everybody else.'' Barbara said: Those words confirmed what I had known all along. Although I was only starting high school, I began to dread what most students anticipate with excitement: graduation day. What if I got into my dream school, but I still couldn't go because I couldn't afford it? In high school, Barbara was a great student and was involved in many extracurricular and volunteer activities. She was a member of the Academic Decathlon team for 4 years and team captain when she was a senior. She was a member of student government, yearbook, and homecoming. She volunteered to tutor middle school students and worked part time to save money for her education. She participated in a number of programs at Arizona State University, including the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism. She recorded a story about her life that was aired on National Public Radio. This experience sparked her interest in journalism and led to an internship at KJZZ, the Phoenix affiliate for NPR. Last year Barbara graduated as valedictorian of her high school class with a 4.5 grade point average. As a result of her accomplishments, Barbara was accepted at Dartmouth College, an Ivy League school, where she is now a sophomore. Barbara wrote a letter to me and said this about DACA: I am very grateful for DACA, as it allowed me to work and not be deported to a country I do not know and have not been to since I was five. Just like thousands of other undocumented students in the United States, I have grown up and become accustomed to the culture here. The U.S. is where I belong and I want to be a contributing member of society, as I have proved in my 13 years here. Barbara and other DREAMers have so much to give. They are young, they are idealistic, they are energetic, and they are amazing. These young people have overcome odds that many young people never face in their lives. To think that in your freshman year of high school, you are reflecting on the fact that even if accepted to college, you may not be able to go--that was her future as she saw it then. If DACA is eliminated, Barbara will lose her legal status and could be deported to Mexico--a country where she hasn't lived since she was 5. Will America be a better country if Barbara is deported or if she stays here and uses her talent, her determination, her energy, and her inspiration, for our future? I think the answer is clear. Now is the time for America, this Nation of immigrants, to come together and heal the wounds that divided us in this election. I am just hoping that this President-elect, when he reflects on Barbara and 700,000-plus other DACA eligibles, will realize that they can bring important values and achievements to America's future. I am hoping that in the Senate, we can overcome our differences--and there are many deep differences, political differences--and give these young people a chance. Senator Graham and I are basically working on a bill that says at least suspend their status so they won't be deported, so they can continue to work. Do that while we do our business here on the issue of immigration. That is only fair. It is only right. It is the right American way to approach an issue that can affect so many innocent American people. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia. Miners Protection Act Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an issue of great urgency--the fate of tens of thousands of American workers. In just a matter of weeks, 16,000 coal miners and their dependents will lose their health care coverage and roughly 6,000 others will join that group in the year 2017, and here we are just days away from Congress wrapping up its work for the year. This should be a time to motivate us to action. I have served in Congress a long time, and I know nothing motivates Congress more than a deadline, being up against a deadline, as we are today. This time should be no different, and here is why: Without some resolution before Congress adjourns, the men and women who have powered our Nation and spurred economic growth for generations will have the carpet ripped out from under them. They will lose the health care benefits they so rely on and have been promised. It is important to recognize the risks our coal miners take to better our lives every day. When you visit a coal mine, which I have done--I have been underground in a coal mine--you see the rigorous and often very dangerous working conditions where these men and women do their job every day to provide the energy we need to light this Chamber, to warm our homes, and to keep our classrooms lit. These miners are the pillars of our communities, and many of them are veterans of our Nation. For decades they have worked hard and played by the rules. Yet the realities facing these men and women are stark. They are up against the wall, and we are up against the wall with them. The challenges they face will only grow if we fail to accommodate and have immediate action. We can talk about the realities of the War on Coal, but this is about more than that. This is about people--tens of thousands of people, mostly older, many suffering health issues--who rely on health care, and many are in need. This is about tens of thousands of coal jobs that have been lost, devastating my region of the country, forcing miners to rely on these modest benefits more than ever before. This is about employers who are bankrupt who can no longer fund these benefit plans. We have a solution right here in front of us that is ready for a vote to prevent any lapse in benefits. It is a solution that has support from both sides of the aisle. We passed the Miners Protection Act out of the Finance Committee in a bipartisan way, and it is a solution that could make a difference in the livelihoods of tens of thousands of Americans. I had really hoped that we could offer the Miners Protection Act as an amendment to the 21st Century Cures [[Page S6699]] bill. The 21st Century Cures bill is all about health. The Miners Protection Act is a lot about the health and well-being of our miners. That is why, despite the many good things and benefits in the 21st Century Cures Act, such as funding for the opioid epidemic that hit my State of West Virginia and many of our States very hard, advanced medicine, and Cancer Moonshot, I had to oppose us moving forward on the Cures Act tonight without an amendment process. That is how important this issue is to our miners. Before Friday we will move forward on a bill to fund our government. We must take action in that bill--which I consider mostly our last chance, the continuing resolution--to protect these important benefits for our miners. If we don't, we will be failing to act for the benefit of thousands of American workers. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

she had never been there. she grew up in brazil for a short period of time. she didn't speak the language. she doesn't speak portuguese. she was caught in the middle. that is why i introduced the dream act. it said that young people brought to the united states by their parents before the age of 16, if they finish school and have no serious criminal issues, should be given a chance to go to school further and have a legal status in america and, ultimately, to earn their way to citizenship--going to the back of the line and waiting their turn but at least setting that as their goal. i introduced that bill 15 years ago. it has never become law, but there are 2.5 million people in that circumstance in america. six years ago, the president of the united states created something called daca, the deferred action for childhood arrivals program, by an executive action. as a result of that action, president obama allowed these eligible dreamers--as they have come to be known--to receive daca status. in order to do it, they have to apply, come out of the shadows, declare themselves, file a fee of about $500 with the government, go through a criminal background check, and then be given temporary--only temporary--legal status so they can't be deported and can [[page s6698]] legally work, which is renewable every 2 years. as of today, 744,000 young people have done that. many of them were in the room--at least some of them were in the room in chicago last friday. they are not certain what is going to happen next. the new president has promised to end daca. if he ends it, what happens to these young people? for instance, there are 28 of these daca young people who are in medical school at loyola university in chicago--28 students who are undocumented who are there without any federal government assistance, and most of them have promised to give a year of service to the state of illinois in rural areas and poor neighborhoods when they become doctors. if they lose their daca status, they lose their ability to work legally in the united states and they cannot go through the clinical experience, which is part of becoming a doctor. they would have to drop out of medical school. there is one thing we can say for certain: we don't have an oversupply of doctors serving inner cities and rural areas in my state and across the nation. we need these doctors. if daca changes, if it is eliminated, what will happen to these young people? that is a challenge which i face, and other members have as well. i salute senator lindsey graham of south carolina. he is working with me on legislation to address this, to at least give a temporary status to these daca-eligible young people while we debate immigration reform in a larger context. there are important issues at stake, but the most fundamental issue is one of fairness and justice. these young people did nothing wrong. they were brought to this country by their parents. they have grown up in this country, gone to our schools, and there are some amazing stories of what they have done with their lives. i wish to tell you one of those stories. i have done this over 100 times now on the floor of the senate. this is barbara olachea. in 2002, when barbara was 5 years old, her family brought her to the united states from mexico. she grew up in phoenix, az, and she knew she would face challenges, being undocumented. her older sister had been accepted to arizona state university but couldn't afford to go to school there. as an undocumented immigrant, she is not eligible for federal financial assistance. arizona law specifically prohibits state financial assistance to dreamers such as barbara and her sister. during her freshman year in high school, a mentor told her that as a dreamer, ``you're going to have to try harder than everybody else.'' barbara said: those words confirmed what i had known all along. although i was only starting high school, i began to dread what most students anticipate with excitement: graduation day. what if i got into my dream school, but i still couldn't go because i couldn't afford it? in high school, barbara was a great student and was involved in many extracurricular and volunteer activities. she was a member of the academic decathlon team for 4 years and team captain when she was a senior. she was a member of student government, yearbook, and homecoming. she volunteered to tutor middle school students and worked part time to save money for her education. she participated in a number of programs at arizona state university, including the walter cronkite school of journalism. she recorded a story about her life that was aired on national public radio. this experience sparked her interest in journalism and led to an internship at kjzz, the phoenix affiliate for npr. last year barbara graduated as valedictorian of her high school class with a 4.5 grade point average. as a result of her accomplishments, barbara was accepted at dartmouth college, an ivy league school, where she is now a sophomore. barbara wrote a letter to me and said this about daca: i am very grateful for daca, as it allowed me to work and not be deported to a country i do not know and have not been to since i was five. just like thousands of other undocumented students in the united states, i have grown up and become accustomed to the culture here. the u.s. is where i belong and i want to be a contributing member of society, as i have proved in my 13 years here. barbara and other dreamers have so much to give. they are young, they are idealistic, they are energetic, and they are amazing. these young people have overcome odds that many young people never face in their lives. to think that in your freshman year of high school, you are reflecting on the fact that even if accepted to college, you may not be able to go--that was her future as she saw it then. if daca is eliminated, barbara will lose her legal status and could be deported to mexico--a country where she hasn't lived since she was 5. will america be a better country if barbara is deported or if she stays here and uses her talent, her determination, her energy, and her inspiration, for our future? i think the answer is clear. now is the time for america, this nation of immigrants, to come together and heal the wounds that divided us in this election. i am just hoping that this president-elect, when he reflects on barbara and 700,000-plus other daca eligibles, will realize that they can bring important values and achievements to america's future. i am hoping that in the senate, we can overcome our differences--and there are many deep differences, political differences--and give these young people a chance. senator graham and i are basically working on a bill that says at least suspend their status so they won't be deported, so they can continue to work. do that while we do our business here on the issue of immigration. that is only fair. it is only right. it is the right american way to approach an issue that can affect so many innocent american people. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from west virginia. miners protection act mrs. capito. mr. president, i rise today to talk about an issue of great urgency--the fate of tens of thousands of american workers. in just a matter of weeks, 16,000 coal miners and their dependents will lose their health care coverage and roughly 6,000 others will join that group in the year 2017, and here we are just days away from congress wrapping up its work for the year. this should be a time to motivate us to action. i have served in congress a long time, and i know nothing motivates congress more than a deadline, being up against a deadline, as we are today. this time should be no different, and here is why: without some resolution before congress adjourns, the men and women who have powered our nation and spurred economic growth for generations will have the carpet ripped out from under them. they will lose the health care benefits they so rely on and have been promised. it is important to recognize the risks our coal miners take to better our lives every day. when you visit a coal mine, which i have done--i have been underground in a coal mine--you see the rigorous and often very dangerous working conditions where these men and women do their job every day to provide the energy we need to light this chamber, to warm our homes, and to keep our classrooms lit. these miners are the pillars of our communities, and many of them are veterans of our nation. for decades they have worked hard and played by the rules. yet the realities facing these men and women are stark. they are up against the wall, and we are up against the wall with them. the challenges they face will only grow if we fail to accommodate and have immediate action. we can talk about the realities of the war on coal, but this is about more than that. this is about people--tens of thousands of people, mostly older, many suffering health issues--who rely on health care, and many are in need. this is about tens of thousands of coal jobs that have been lost, devastating my region of the country, forcing miners to rely on these modest benefits more than ever before. this is about employers who are bankrupt who can no longer fund these benefit plans. we have a solution right here in front of us that is ready for a vote to prevent any lapse in benefits. it is a solution that has support from both sides of the aisle. we passed the miners protection act out of the finance committee in a bipartisan way, and it is a solution that could make a difference in the livelihoods of tens of thousands of americans. i had really hoped that we could offer the miners protection act as an amendment to the 21st century cures [[page s6699]] bill. the 21st century cures bill is all about health. the miners protection act is a lot about the health and well-being of our miners. that is why, despite the many good things and benefits in the 21st century cures act, such as funding for the opioid epidemic that hit my state of west virginia and many of our states very hard, advanced medicine, and cancer moonshot, i had to oppose us moving forward on the cures act tonight without an amendment process. that is how important this issue is to our miners. before friday we will move forward on a bill to fund our government. we must take action in that bill--which i consider mostly our last chance, the continuing resolution--to protect these important benefits for our miners. if we don't, we will be failing to act for the benefit of thousands of american workers. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. moran. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",16157

Mr. President, 15 years ago Senator Dick Durbin introduced the DREAM Act in the U.S. Senate. This legislation provided a path to citizenship for young people brought to the U.S. as children. These young people call themselves DREAMers. And they are as American as you or me. They belong to this country culturally and linguistically and are American in all but paperwork. For many of them, this is the only country they have ever known. In 2010, the DREAM Act passed the House and came to the Senate for a vote. Sadly, Republicans killed the bill--eliminating the hopes and dreams of hundreds of thousands of DREAMers. Because Republicans refused to act, it was up to President Obama. In 2011, I joined 21 other Senators in asking President Obama to grant deferred action to immigrant youth who would have qualified under the DREAM Act and who are not an enforcement priority. And in 2012, President Obama's administration did just that. They announced that young people who were brought to the United States as children could apply for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, also known as DACA. This brought nearly 800,000 young people out of the shadows. These young men and women are our newest college students, teachers, engineers, and small business owners. They contribute to our communities and make America better. In Nevada alone, DACA has helped over 12,000 DREAMers--DREAMers like Brenda Romero. Brenda was just 2 years old when she crossed the border in southern California with her mother to reunite with members of their family. Growing up in Las Vegas, Brenda was like any other American kid. She excelled in school, participated in student government and played the cello in the orchestra. But soon enough, she realized what it truly meant to be undocumented. Her friends could get their driver's licenses; Brenda could not. Her peers could get legally paying jobs; Brenda could not. Her classmates could speak with recruiters from the Armed Services about career opportunities; Brenda could not. Brenda described the months after graduating high school as one of the lowest points in her life. But that all changed with DACA. She was finally able to get a job and enrolled in the College of Southern Nevada as soon as she saved enough money. Brenda became student body president her second year at the College of Southern Nevada, working to help other students who faced struggles similar to hers. During her time as student body president, Brenda helped award $10,000 to her fellow classmates in scholarship funds. Brenda graduated from CSN with an associate's degree in art and is currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in human services at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. She wants to be a higher education counselor, and she is already well on her way. She is already making her mark on the UNLV campus. As part of the Undocu-network Club, Brenda is helping to bring counseling and services to students in need and promoting visibility for undocumented students to the school administration. Brenda's story is impressive, but it is not unique. Every Senator has a story to tell like Brenda's. There are young men and women just like her in all 50 states. In addition to the moral reasons for supporting DACA, there are strong economic reasons. DACA recipients will add $433 billion to the economy over 10 years. After DACA, more than two-thirds of recipients were able to secure a job and their wages rose by 42 percent. Six percent of recipients started their own businesses, a rate that is nearly double the rate among the entire U.S. population. Fifty-four percent of recipients bought cars, and 12 percent bought houses, all of which means significant new tax revenue for States and localities. DACA recipients will add $433 billion to the economy over 10 years. It is not surprising that the majority of Americans--almost 60 percent-- oppose repeal of DACA. As with Brenda, DACA has opened doors of opportunity for hundreds of thousands of young people. We hoped that it would be a stop-gap measure until we passed immigration reform. The Senate overwhelmingly passed a bipartisan bill but the House refused to bring it to a vote. With the outcome of the election, it isn't likely that comprehensive immigration reform will happen over the next 4 years. That is why it is so important for the next administration to continue this vital program. For Brenda and hundreds of thousands like her, losing DACA status means being adrift in the only country she calls home. I urge the next administration: Don't put almost 800,000 young people back in the shadows where they are afraid. Don't force hundreds of thousands of DREAMers to lose their jobs. And don't squander the huge economic benefits to this country. If Republicans want to do something, then they should pass the DREAM Act. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S6699] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DACA Mr. REID.

brenda could not. her peers could get legally paying jobs; brenda could not. her classmates could speak with recruiters from the armed services about career opportunities; brenda could not. brenda described the months after graduating high school as one of the lowest points in her life. but that all changed with daca. she was finally able to get a job and enrolled in the college of southern nevada as soon as she saved enough money. brenda became student body president her second year at the college of southern nevada, working to help other students who faced struggles similar to hers. during her time as student body president, brenda helped award $10,000 to her fellow classmates in scholarship funds. brenda graduated from csn with an associate's degree in art and is currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in human services at the university of nevada, las vegas. she wants to be a higher education counselor, and she is already well on her way. she is already making her mark on the unlv campus. as part of the undocu-network club, brenda is helping to bring counseling and services to students in need and promoting visibility for undocumented students to the school administration. brenda's story is impressive, but it is not unique. every senator has a story to tell like brenda's. there are young men and women just like her in all 50 states. in addition to the moral reasons for supporting daca, there are strong economic reasons. daca recipients will add $433 billion to the economy over 10 years. after daca, more than two-thirds of recipients were able to secure a job and their wages rose by 42 percent. six percent of recipients started their own businesses, a rate that is nearly double the rate among the entire u.s. population. fifty-four percent of recipients bought cars, and 12 percent bought houses, all of which means significant new tax revenue for states and localities. daca recipients will add $433 billion to the economy over 10 years. it is not surprising that the majority of americans--almost 60 percent-- oppose repeal of daca. as with brenda, daca has opened doors of opportunity for hundreds of thousands of young people. we hoped that it would be a stop-gap measure until we passed immigration reform. the senate overwhelmingly passed a bipartisan bill but the house refused to bring it to a vote. with the outcome of the election, it isn't likely that comprehensive immigration reform will happen over the next 4 years. that is why it is so important for the next administration to continue this vital program. for brenda and hundreds of thousands like her, losing daca status means being adrift in the only country she calls home. i urge the next administration: don't put almost 800,000 young people back in the shadows where they are afraid. don't force hundreds of thousands of dreamers to lose their jobs. and don't squander the huge economic benefits to this country. if republicans want to do something, then they should pass the dream act. ____________________",5039

It incorporates a central tire inflation system, run-flat tires, and a vehicle height management system. The Stryker is capable of supporting a communications suite, a Global Positioning System (GPS), and a high frequency and near-term digital radio systems. The Stryker is deployable by C-130 aircraft and combat capable upon arrival. The Stryker is capable of self-deployment by highway and self-recovery. It has a low noise level that reduces crew fatigue and enhances survivability. It moves about the battlefield quickly and is optimized for close, complex, or urban terrain. The Stryker program leverages non- developmental items with common subsystems and components to quickly acquire and filed these systems. 2. The AN/VAS-5 Driver's Vision Enhancer (DVE) is a compact thermal camera providing armored vehicle drivers with day or night time visual awareness in clear or reduced vision (fog, smoke, dust) situations. The system provides the driver a 180 degree viewing angle using a high resolution infrared sensor and image stabilization to reduce the effect of shock and vibration. The viewer and monitor are ruggedized for operation in tactical environments. The system is UNCLASSIFIED but considered sensitive technology. If a technically advanced adversary were to obtain knowledge of the AN/VAS-5, the information could be used to identify ways to countering the system or improve the adversary's ability to avoid detection by the system in low-visibility environments. This is a low-level concern because the thermal imaging technology used in the AN/VAS-5 is considered mature and available in other industrial nation's comparable performance thresholds. 3.

CREC-2016-12-05-pt1-PgS6702,CREC-2016-12-05,114,TRIBUTE TO GENERAL RAHEEL SHARIF,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S6702] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO GENERAL RAHEEL SHARIF Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the accomplishments of General Raheel Sharif and to express my gratitude to him upon his retirement as Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff. General Sharif has been a vital partner for the United States in the battle against terrorism. Since taking office in November 2013, General Sharif has continued to target terrorists operating within the borders of Pakistan. He has carried the fight to the northwest frontier provinces of Pakistan, as well as promised to eliminate safe havens for terrorists from the country completely. In taking these actions, General Sharif has demonstrated that fighting against extremist groups is firmly in the national security interests of Pakistan. General Sharif comes from a military family, with a long tradition of patriotism and service to country. Among his many brave military family members, his older brother Major Rana Shabbir Sharif, who was killed in action, is regarded as the most decorated officer of the Pakistan Army, having received the three most coveted awards of the Army, and is fondly addressed as the army's ``Superman.'' This is a legacy difficult to live up to, but General Sharif has done so, honoring his brother and family's service, and continuing to serve and protect his country and its institutions. Since taking on the role of Chief of Army Staff, General Sharif has been at the forefront of fighting the Taliban and other terrorist groups inside Pakistan. In 2014, he initiated the launch of Operation Zarb-e-Azb in North Waziristan, a tribal area along the Afghanistan- Pakistan border where militants had operated with impunity for decades. This operation didn't eliminate every terrorist, nor has it denied safe haven to many who continue to operate from Pakistan. But it has led to security improvements in the country, and this area is now safer than ever before. And importantly, the Pakistani Army is continuing to secure the gains it has achieved by building roads, border posts, schools, and healthcare facilities across North Waziristan to promote economic development and give citizens a more prosperous and peaceful future. In the south, General Sharif also took on the task of clearing Karachi, one of Pakistan's largest cities, of an array of terrorist organizations, criminal groups, and even political corruption. The results were equally impressive, leading to a dramatic decline in militant attacks and ending the kind of targeted killings, kidnappings for ransom, and extortion that had become a feature of life in the city. Much of the credit for the success of these operations is due to General Sharif and the service and sacrifice of tens of thousands of Pakistani soldiers who followed his lead. What was remarkable about General Sharif was not only the commitment he demonstrated to rooting out terrorism, but also his efforts to improve economic development, political life, and civic services for citizens throughout the country. He recognized that failure to focus on the root causes of radicalization, including economic and political corruption, had exacerbated the growth of extremism in Pakistan, and he showed foresight in seeking to remedy both cause and effect. This is the kind of leadership that is imperative for the continued improvement of relations between the United States and Pakistan, which is important for the stability of the entire region, and for the national security of both Pakistan and the United States. But despite the progress I witnessed firsthand when I visited Pakistan this past summer, the U.S.-Pakistan relationship has become strained. Among other things, limitations on U.S. assistance to Pakistan and congressional opposition to approve funding for the sale of defense articles have added to tensions between our two governments. But even with these difficulties, U.S. and Pakistani leaders cannot allow ambivalence and suspicion to fester in our relationship. Our common interests in counterterrorism, nuclear security, and regional stability are too important and too urgent. Both sides share responsibility to improve U.S.-Pakistan relations, and the United States must continue to make clear its enduring commitment to Pakistan's stability and economic growth. As we look to the future, there remains much to be done. While Pakistan has made progress in its fight against terrorism, the Haqqani Network continues to operate within its border, increasing cross-border attacks are carried out by armed militants on neighboring countries, and political corruption has stilted economic growth. Pakistan must demonstrate that the commitment to fighting terrorism and improving conditions in the country is not dependent on a single individual. In that spirit, I look forward to working with General Qamar Javed Bajwa, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's selection to be the next Chief of Army Staff. By taking on all terrorist groups operating in its country, Pakistan will find that the United States remains willing and able to assist in this fight and develop an enduring strategic partnership. I congratulate Pakistan on carrying out a second consecutive transition of power in the military, and I wish General Sharif well as he enters a well-earned retirement. He has vowed to serve Pakistan even after his retirement, and I would expect nothing less. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S6702] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO GENERAL RAHEEL SHARIF Mr. McCAIN.

But despite the progress I witnessed firsthand when I visited Pakistan this past summer, the U.S.-Pakistan relationship has become strained. Among other things, limitations on U.S. assistance to Pakistan and congressional opposition to approve funding for the sale of defense articles have added to tensions between our two governments. But even with these difficulties, U.S. and Pakistani leaders cannot allow ambivalence and suspicion to fester in our relationship. Our common interests in counterterrorism, nuclear security, and regional stability are too important and too urgent. Both sides share responsibility to improve U.S.-Pakistan relations, and the United States must continue to make clear its enduring commitment to Pakistan's stability and economic growth. As we look to the future, there remains much to be done. While Pakistan has made progress in its fight against terrorism, the Haqqani Network continues to operate within its border, increasing cross-border attacks are carried out by armed militants on neighboring countries, and political corruption has stilted economic growth. Pakistan must demonstrate that the commitment to fighting terrorism and improving conditions in the country is not dependent on a single individual. In that spirit, I look forward to working with General Qamar Javed Bajwa, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's selection to be the next Chief of Army Staff. By taking on all terrorist groups operating in its country, Pakistan will find that the United States remains willing and able to assist in this fight and develop an enduring strategic partnership. I congratulate Pakistan on carrying out a second consecutive transition of power in the military, and I wish General Sharif well as he enters a well-earned retirement. He has vowed to serve Pakistan even after his retirement, and I would expect nothing less. ____________________",package_114_212.csv,5574,5574,5644,"[congressional record volume 162, number 174 (monday, december 5, 2016)] [senate] [page s6702] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] tribute to general raheel sharif mr. mccain. mr. president, today i wish to recognize the accomplishments of general raheel sharif and to express my gratitude to him upon his retirement as pakistan's chief of army staff. general sharif has been a vital partner for the united states in the battle against terrorism. since taking office in november 2013, general sharif has continued to target terrorists operating within the borders of pakistan. he has carried the fight to the northwest frontier provinces of pakistan, as well as promised to eliminate safe havens for terrorists from the country completely. in taking these actions, general sharif has demonstrated that fighting against extremist groups is firmly in the national security interests of pakistan. general sharif comes from a military family, with a long tradition of patriotism and service to country. among his many brave military family members, his older brother major rana shabbir sharif, who was killed in action, is regarded as the most decorated officer of the pakistan army, having received the three most coveted awards of the army, and is fondly addressed as the army's ``superman.'' this is a legacy difficult to live up to, but general sharif has done so, honoring his brother and family's service, and continuing to serve and protect his country and its institutions. since taking on the role of chief of army staff, general sharif has been at the forefront of fighting the taliban and other terrorist groups inside pakistan. in 2014, he initiated the launch of operation zarb-e-azb in north waziristan, a tribal area along the afghanistan- pakistan border where militants had operated with impunity for decades. this operation didn't eliminate every terrorist, nor has it denied safe haven to many who continue to operate from pakistan. but it has led to security improvements in the country, and this area is now safer than ever before. and importantly, the pakistani army is continuing to secure the gains it has achieved by building roads, border posts, schools, and healthcare facilities across north waziristan to promote economic development and give citizens a more prosperous and peaceful future. in the south, general sharif also took on the task of clearing karachi, one of pakistan's largest cities, of an array of terrorist organizations, criminal groups, and even political corruption. the results were equally impressive, leading to a dramatic decline in militant attacks and ending the kind of targeted killings, kidnappings for ransom, and extortion that had become a feature of life in the city. much of the credit for the success of these operations is due to general sharif and the service and sacrifice of tens of thousands of pakistani soldiers who followed his lead. what was remarkable about general sharif was not only the commitment he demonstrated to rooting out terrorism, but also his efforts to improve economic development, political life, and civic services for citizens throughout the country. he recognized that failure to focus on the root causes of radicalization, including economic and political corruption, had exacerbated the growth of extremism in pakistan, and he showed foresight in seeking to remedy both cause and effect. this is the kind of leadership that is imperative for the continued improvement of relations between the united states and pakistan, which is important for the stability of the entire region, and for the national security of both pakistan and the united states. but despite the progress i witnessed firsthand when i visited pakistan this past summer, the u.s.-pakistan relationship has become strained. among other things, limitations on u.s. assistance to pakistan and congressional opposition to approve funding for the sale of defense articles have added to tensions between our two governments. but even with these difficulties, u.s. and pakistani leaders cannot allow ambivalence and suspicion to fester in our relationship. our

CREC-2016-12-05-pt1-PgS6702-2,CREC-2016-12-05,114,SECRETARY KERRY'S REMARKS AT COP22,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6702-S6706] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SECRETARY KERRY'S REMARKS AT COP22 Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, last year the world came together in Paris to support a truly historic agreement on climate change. And 2015 was also historic for another reason: It was the hottest year in an observational record that stretches back to the 1880s. In fact, 15 of the 16 hottest years on the planet have occurred since 2000. Recently, July and August 2016 tied the global record for the hottest month, and 2016 is on track to be the warmest year yet. The evidence on climate change is overwhelming. Scientists have understood the fundamental physics for over a century. And the world agrees that we must take action to curb dangerous carbon pollution and reduce the effects of climate change. A majority of the United States agrees that we must take action. The swiftness with which the Paris Climate Accord came into force demonstrates the global commitment to addressing the serious concerns of climate change. It is also a testament to the leadership of President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry. This year, the world again came together at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Marrakesh, Morocco, to begin forging the path towards a lower-emissions world and clean energy future. And while there is much work to be done, we are heading in the right direction. We have seen the price of solar energy reach record lows and the rate of new solar installation reach record highs. We have seen States, regions, and countries reduce their carbon pollution while growing their economies. These positive steps will not only curb carbon pollution, but also create good, well-paying clean energy jobs. Climate change is a challenge for the entire world. Through the Paris Climate Accord, the international community has decided to face this challenge head on, and the United States must continue to be the global leader. [[Page S6703]] Under the leadership of Sectary of State John Kerry, the United States has carried this mantle. In the speech that Secretary Kerry delivered last month in Marrakesh, Morocco, at the 22nd meeting of the Conference of Parties to the United Nationals Framework Convention on Climate Change and first session of the Conference of Parties to the Paris Agreement, Secretary Kerry shared his vision for our future: a brighter, cleaner, healthier and more prosperous one. He said: Thank you so much, everybody. I apologize for being a few moments late. There was a fire and then there was some traffic backed up, and so here I am and here are you, and thank you for being here. Let me begin by thanking our terrific U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Change Jonathan Pershing. I couldn't be luckier than to have him in this job. He was over at the Energy Department for a while. We stole him from Ernie Moniz, who is a great colleague and was gracious in my theft. And he has done a spectacular job working with all of our international partners as we begin the hard work of implementing the Paris Agreement. And I also want to thank Ambassador Jennifer Haverkamp, who, along with Jonathan and a lot of the team that I see sitting here, has done an absolutely terrific job in leading the State Department's efforts to advance our climate goals this year. And I have to tell you--well, let me just divert for a minute. I also want to thank Brian Deese--I don't know if he's here--but I'm grateful for President Obama's senior advisor on climate issues and the entire intrepid U.S. delegation to the COP, whom I had a chance to meet with earlier this morning, but we've kind of traveled this road together. I also thank our international partners, and particularly the executive secretary of the UNFCCC, Patricia Espinosa; the outgoing president of the COP, Minister Segolene Royal of France; and the incoming COP president, my friend and our host this week, Minister Salaheddine Mezouar, the foreign minister of Morocco. And I also want to thank our partners from Fiji, who will serve as president for the next COP, which I intend hopefully to attend as Citizen Kerry. It's a great pleasure for me to be able to be here in Marrakech. I'm reminded of one of the 20th century's most outsized figures whose connection with this city is so famous--Sir Winston Churchill. He loved to paint the landscapes here and to absorb the beauty and the culture. And in fact, at the very height of World War II, as he and President Franklin Roosevelt and Allied leaders gathered in Casablanca to plan the strategy for the European Theater, Churchill was absolutely stunned to learn that Roosevelt had never been to this part of Morocco. So in a move that perhaps only Winston Churchill would get away with in the middle of a global war--world war--Churchill convinced Roosevelt to extend his visit and drive through what was still, at the time, a country engulfed in active combat. So after several hours on the loose, and because we're talking about Winston Churchill, plenty of Scotch-- (laughter)--the two leaders arrived in Marrakech in time to see the sun set on the Atlas Mountains. And Churchill said it was the loveliest view on Earth. So I think it's fitting, therefore, that almost three- quarters of a century later, friends and allies meet again in Marrakech in order to undertake a very important discussion-- a discussion about the natural world that surrounds us and the importance of preserving it for generations to come. As Jonathan mentioned, climate change is deeply personal to me, but it's personal to everyone in this room. I know that. And we obviously want it to be just as personal for everyone in every room: men, women, children, businesspeople, consumers, parents, teachers, students, grandparents. Wherever we live, whatever our calling, whatever our background must be, this is an imperative. Now, I know the danger of preaching to the choir--and, obviously, all of us here are the proverbial choir. But I'm actually grateful for that, because here at the 22nd COP, no one can deny the remarkable progress that we have made-- progress that actually was pretty hard to imagine even a few years ago. The global community is more united than ever not just in accepting the challenge, but in confronting it with real action, in making a difference. And no one should doubt the overwhelming majority of the citizens of the United States who know climate change is happening and who are determined to keep our commitments that were made in Paris. (Applause.) None of us will forget the moment last December at Le Bourget, when the former foreign minister of France, with Segolene and a bunch of you there, led by our friend Laurent Fabius, who gaveled in the strongest, most ambitious global climate agreement ever negotiated. It was an accord that took literally decades to achieve--the proud work product of principled diplomacy, and ultimately, a deeply held, shared understanding that we're all in this together. And when we left Paris, no one rested on their laurels. Instead, the world--unified--moved expeditiously to begin the--to pull the agreement permanently into force, crossing the thresholds of 55 countries representing 55 percent of global emissions, and doing so far faster than even the most optimistic among us might have predicted. In a powerful statement of the whole world's broad commitment to this agreement, in less than a year, 109 countries representing nearly 75 percent of the world's emissions have now formally committed to bold, decisive action--and we are determined to affirm that action and to stick with it out of Marrakech. Now, we have in place--(applause)--so we have in place a foundation, based on national climate goals--109 nations, each of them have come up with their own plan, each of us setting goals that are based on our own abilities and our own circumstances. This agreement is, in fact, the essence of common but differentiated responsibilities. It provides support to countries that need help meeting the targets. It leaves no country to weather the storm of climate change alone. It marshals an array of tools in order to help developing nations to invest in infrastructure, technology, and the science to get the job done. It supports the most vulnerable countries, so they can better adapt to the climate impacts that many of those countries are already confronting. And finally, it enables us to ratchet up ambition over time as technology develops and as the price of clean energy comes down. This is critical: the agreement calls on the parties to revisit their national pledges every five years, in order to ensure that we keep pace with the technology and that we accelerate the global transition to a clean energy economy. This process--a cornerstone of our agreement--gives us a framework that is built to last, and a degree of global accountability that has never before existed. But I want to share with you that the progress that we've made this year goes well beyond Paris. In early October, the International Civil Aviation Organization established a sector-wide agreement for carbon- neutral growth. Why is this so important? Because international aviation wasn't covered by what we did in Paris, and if that aviation was a country, it would rank among the top dozen greenhouse gas emitters in the world. A few weeks later, I was pleased to be in Kigali, Rwanda, when representatives from again nearly 200 countries came together to phase down the global use and production of hydrofluorocarbons--which has been expected to increase very rapidly with a danger that is multiple of times more damaging than carbon dioxide. The Kigali agreement could singlehandedly help us to avoid an entire half a degree centigrade of warming by the end of the century--while at the same time opening up new opportunities for growth in a range of industries. All of these steps combine to move the needle in the direction that we need to. And in large part because global leaders have woken up to the enormity of this challenge, the world is now beginning to move forward together towards a clean energy future. Over the past decade, the global renewable energy market has expanded more than six-fold. Last year, investment in renewable energy was at an all-time high--nearly $350 billion. But that only tells you part of the story. An average of--that 350 billion is the first time that we've been able to see that money outpacing what is being put into fossil fuels. An average of half a million new solar panels were installed every single day last year. And for the first time since the Pre-Industrial Era, despite the fact that you have global prices of oil and gas and coal that are lower than ever, still more of the world's money was invested in renewable energy technologies than in new fossil fuel plants. And like many of you, I've seen this transformation take hold in my own country. That's why I'm confident about the future, regardless of what policy might be chosen, because of the marketplace. I've met with leaders and innovators in the energy industry all across our nation, and I am excited about the path that they are on. America's wind generation has tripled since 2008 and that will continue, and solar generation has increased 30 times over. And the reason both of those will continue is that the marketplace will dictate that, not the government. I can tell you with confidence that the United States is right now, today, on our way to meeting all of the international targets that we've set, and because of the market decisions that are being made, I do not believe that that can or will be reversed. (Applause.) Now, much of this is due to President Obama's leadership, and our Congress also moving in a bipartisan fashion on things like tax credits for renewable energy. This leadership has helped to inspire targeted investment from the private sector. Today our emissions are being driven down because market-based forces are taking hold all over the world. And that's what we said we would do in Paris. None of us pretended that in Paris, the agreement itself was going to achieve two degrees. What we knew is we were sending that critical message to the marketplace, and businesses have responded, as I just described. Most businesspeople have come to understand: investing in clean energy simply makes good economic sense. You can make money. You can do good and do well at the same time. Now, significantly, the renewable energy boom isn't limited to industrialized countries, and that's important to note. In fact, emerging economies like China, India, and Brazil invested even more in renewable technologies last year than the developed world. China alone invested more than 100 billion dollars. Ultimately, clean energy is expected [[Page S6704]] to be a multitrillion dollar market--the largest market the world has ever known. And no nation will do well if it sits on the sidelines, handicapping its new businesses from reaping the benefits of the clean-tech explosion. My friends, we are in the midst of a global renewable energy surge, and as a result, in many places, clean energy has already reached cost parity with fossil fuels. Millions around the world are currently employed by the renewable energy industry. And if we make the right choices, millions more people will be put to work. So good things are happening. The energy curve is bending towards sustainability. The market is clearly headed towards clean energy, and that trend will only become more pronounced. Now, for those of us who have been working on this challenge for decades, this really is a turning point. It is a cause for optimism, notwithstanding what you see in different countries with respect to politics and change. In no uncertain terms, the question now is not whether we will transition to energy economy--to a clean energy economy. That we've already begun to do. The question now is whether or not we are going to have the will to get this job done. That's the question now--whether we will make the transition in time to be able to do what we have to do to prevent catastrophic damage. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm not a Cassandra. You can tell from what I've said. But I'm a realist. Time is not on our side. The world is already changing at an increasingly alarming rate with increasingly alarming consequences. The last time that Morocco hosted the COP was in 2001, and the intervening 15 years have been among the 16 hottest years in recorded history. 2016 is going to be the warmest year of all. Every month so far has broken a record. And this year will contribute its record-breaking heat to the hottest decade in recorded history, which was, by the way, preceded by the second-hottest decade, which was preceded by the third hottest decade. At some point, even the strongest skeptic has to acknowledge that something disturbing is happening. We have seen record-breaking droughts everywhere--from India to Brazil to the west coast of the United States. Storms that used to happen once every 500 years are becoming relatively normal. In recent years, an average of 22.5 million people have been displaced by extreme weather events annually. We never saw that in the 20th Century. Communities in island states like Fiji have already been forced to take steps to relocate permanently, because the places they have called home for generations are now uninhabitable. And there are many, many more who know it's only a matter of time before rising oceans begin to inundate their cities. I know this is a lot for anyone to process--hard to process. That's why I have found that whenever possible, the best way to try to understand and to see whether people are pushing the envelope of thinking on this or not is to see for oneself what is happening. That's why this summer I went to Greenland to visit the incredible Jakobshavn glacier. Scientists pointed out to me the lines many meters above the water today that mark the glacier's retreat which it has done more in the past 15 years than it did in the entire previous century. And while I was there, I boarded a Danish naval vessel and I traveled through the ice fjord. I saw the massive ice chunks that had just broken off from the glacier to melt inexorably into the sea. And because they come off Greenland, which is on rock, every bit of that ice contributes to the rise of the ocean. Since the 1990s, the painful pace of that melting has nearly tripled. Every day, 86 million metric tons of ice makes its way down that fjord into the ocean. And the total flow that comes off that glacier in a single year is enough water to meet the needs of New York City for two decades. But experts in Greenland and elsewhere have always warned me, and they warned me on this trip this summer, if you really want to understand what's happening and what the threat is, go to Antarctica. Nowhere on the planet are the stakes as high as they are on the opposite end of the globe. For half a century, climate scientists have believed the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is a sword of Damocles hanging over our entire way of life. Should it break apart and melt into the sea, it alone could raise global sea levels by four to five meters. And the scientists down there described to me how the pressure of the ice and the weight of the ice pushes the entire continent down so that it's grounded on the base of Earth's crust and rock. But that allows warmer sea water to creep in under the glacier and speed up the process of the melting and destabilize the glacier. Antarctica contains ice sheets that are, in some places, on the East Antarctic Ice Sheet three miles deep. And if all that ice were somehow able to melt away completely because we are irresponsible about climate change, in the coming centuries, sea level would rise somewhere over 100 to 200 feet. That's why I flew last week to McMurdo Station in Antarctica to meet with our scientists and to understand better what is taking place. I flew by helicopter over the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. I walked out onto the Ross Sea ice shelf. And I talked with the scientists who are on the front lines, not people involved in day to day politics, but people who are making scientific judgment and doing extensive research. And they were crystal clear: The more they learn, the more alarmed they become about the speed with which these changes are happening. A scientist from New Zealand named Gavin Dunbar described what they're seeing there as the quote, ``canary in the coal mine'' and warned that some thresholds, if we cross them, cannot be reversed. In other words, we can't wait too long to translate the science that we have today into the policies that are necessary to address this challenge. These scientists urged me to remind my own government and governments around the world and everyone here that what we do right now--today-- matters, because if we don't go far enough and if we don't go fast enough, the damage we inflict could take centuries to undo--if it can be undone at all. I underscore today: We don't get a second chance. The consequences of failure would in most cases be irreversible. And if we lose this moment for action, there's no speech decades from now that will put these massive ice sheets back together. There's no magic wand in any capital in the world that you can wave to refill all of the lakes and rivers that will dry up, or make farm--arid farm land fertile again. And we certainly won't have the power to hold back rising tides as they encroach on our shores. So we have to get this right, and we have to get it right now. The scientists in Antarctica told me that they are still trying to figure out how quickly this is all happening. But they know for certain that it's happening, and it's happening faster than we previously thought possible. The alarm bells ought to be going off everywhere. As an American glacial geologist told me down there, a fellow by the name of John Stone, he said, ``The catastrophic period could already be underway.'' That's why wise public policy demands that we take precautionary measures now. Still, despite the real-life changes that are being done and the threat of more to come, it's important to remind ourselves that we are not on a pre-ordained path to disaster. This is not pre-ordained. It's not written in the stars. This is about choices--choices that we still have. This is a test of willpower, not capacity. It's within our power to put the planet back on a better track. But doing that requires holding ourselves accountable to the hard truth. It requires holding ourselves accountable to facts, not opinion; to science, not theories that haven't been proven and can't be proven; and certainly not to political bromides and slogans. For all the progress that we are making, at the current pace we will not meet our goal. I said that earlier. We knew in Paris that what we were doing was trying to start down a road. But we also knew it doesn't get us to the end of the journey. Yes, renewables make up more than half of all the new electricity installation last year. That's progress. But the reality is because of the existing energy infrastructure already in place, that new energy only generated a little more than 10 percent of the world's total energy. That is nowhere near what we need in order to achieve our goals. If we're going to have the ability to stave off the worst impacts of climate change, we have to dramatically accelerate the transition that is already starting. We need to get to a point where clean sources are generating most of the world's energy, and we need to get there fast. Certainly experts tell us by the middle of this century we have to get there. Now, I've said many times, and I'll say it again today: It is not going to be governments alone, or even principally, that solve the climate challenge. The private sector is the most important player. And already we are seeing real solutions coming from entrepreneurs and academia. It's going to be innovators, workers, and business leaders, many of whom have been hammering away at this challenge for years who are going to continue to create the technological advances that forever revolutionize the way that we power our world. But make no mistake, government leadership is absolutely essential. And because today is the last opportunity I will have to address the COP as Secretary of State, I just want to take a moment to underscore the work that government leaders can do and should do, especially the 200--almost 200 nations represented here. Now, we know that we have not come to Marrakech to bask in the glow of Paris. We've come here to move forward. In doing so, we cannot forget that the contributions we've each made thus far were never meant to be the ceiling. They're a foundation on which we expect to build. And unless our nations voluntarily ratchet up our ambition, and unless we continue to put sustained pressure on one another to act wisely, we will have difficulty meeting the current mitigation needs, let alone holding temperature increases at 2 degrees warming, which science tells us is a tipping point. And if we fall short, it will be the single greatest instance in modern history of a generation in a time of crisis abdicating responsibility for the future. And it won't just be a policy failure; because of the nature of this challenge, it will be a moral failure, a betrayal of devastating consequence. Now, I know not--that's not what any of us here signed up for. As Pope Francis said, ``We receive this world as an inheritance from past generations, but also as a loan for future generations, to whom we will have to return it.'' Now, I fully recognize the challenges that a number of countries face because they have a big population, they have a growing economy, they have a lot of people in poverty, [[Page S6705]] they're determined to maintain stability and pull those people into the economy. And of course, they're concerned about stability--we all are. Access to affordable energy is a key part of providing that stability. And the dirtiest sources of energy are, unfortunately, some of the cheapest. But I emphasize this: Only in the short term. In the long term, it's an entirely different story, folks. In the long term, carbon-intensive energy is actually today, right now, one of the costliest and most foolhardy investments any nation can possibly make. And that is because the final invoice for carbon-based energy includes a lot more than just the price of the oil or the coal, or the natural gas; it--or the price of building the power plant. The real cost accounting needs to fully consider all of the downstream consequences, which, in the case of dirty fuels, are enough to at least double or triple the initial expenses. That's the kind of accounting that we need to do today. Just think about the price of environmental and agricultural degradation. Think about the loss of an ability of farmers in one area because of the lack of water or too much heat to be able to grow their crops today. Think of the hospital bills for asthma and emphysema patients, and the millions of deaths that are linked to air pollution caused by the use of fossil fuels. In 2014, a study found that up to six million people in China have black lung because they lived and worked so close to coal-fired power plants. There are nearly 20 million new asthma cases a year in India linked to coal-related air pollution, and in the United States, asthma costs taxpayers more than $55 billion annually. The greatest cause of children being hospitalized in the summer in the United States is environmentally induced asthma. These are real costs, and they need to be added to the tally. We also have to include the price tag of rebuilding after devastating storms and flooding. Just in the first three quarters of this year alone, extreme weather events have cost the United States--have cost American taxpayers $27 billion in damage. In August alone, Louisiana experienced flooding that resulted in roughly $10 billion worth of damage. So none of us can afford to be oblivious to these expenses, and these initial costs are in reality just a glimpse of what the future could hold in store for us if we fail to respond. Just imagine: Sea barriers that have to be built. Go down to Miami--in south Miami, they're building--they're raising streets to deal with flooding that's already occurring, building new storm drains and assessing people additional tax in order to do it. Massive increases in cost of maintaining infrastructure to control flooding, withstand storms. Power outages. All of this and more has to be added to any honest assessment of high-carbon energy sources. And in an age of increasing transparency and public demand for accountability, citizens in the long run will not accept phony accounting or an obfuscation of the consequences of the decisions. So everyone needs to make smarter choices--with the long game, not the short game, in mind. Coal, unfortunately, is the single biggest contributor to global carbon pollution. It provides about 30 percent of the world's energy, but it produces nearly 50 percent of the world's greenhouse gases. The unprecedented investments that we are now seeing in clean energy will mean very, very little if, at the same time, new coal fire plants without carbon capture are coming online and at a rate dumping into the atmosphere more and more of the very pollution that we're all working so hard to reduce. Some of these projections, I have to tell you, are deeply troubling. For example, between now and 2040, the demand for electricity in Southeast Asia is likely to triple--and the bulk of that demand is currently expected to be met by growth--where? In the coal-fired power sector, rather than clean energy. That threatens everything we're trying to achieve here. We literally cannot use one hand to pat ourselves on the back for what we've done to take steps to address climate change, and then turn around and use the other hand to write a big fat check enabling the widespread development of the dirtiest source of fuel in an outdated way. It just doesn't make sense. That's suicide. And that's how we all lose this fight. Make no mistake: People all over the world are working for victory in this. And this issue is increasingly capturing the attention of citizens everywhere, and certainly the private sector. The private sector welcomed the signals that we sent in Paris, but they are demanding even stronger signals now-- the private sector--so that they can invest clean energy solutions with even greater confidence. One of the strongest signals that government can send, one of the most powerful ways to reduce emissions at the lowest possible course--cost--is to move toward carbon pricing that puts basic, free-market economics to work in addressing this challenge. Now obviously, this is not a new idea. Many have come to this conclusion already. The share of global emissions that are covered by a carbon price has tripled over the last decade. Last year, more than 1,000 businesses and investors-- including sectors that might be surprising to some of you-- all came together to voice their support for carbon pricing. The long list of supporters includes energy companies like BP, Royal Dutch Shell, utilities like PG&E, transportation companies like British Airways, construction firms like Cemex, financial institutions like Deutsche Bank, like Swiss Re, and consumer goods corporations like Unilever and Nokia. These companies all believe that carbon pricing will establish the necessary certainty in the marketplace that helps the private sector to move the capital that helps to solve the problem. Carbon pricing allows citizens, innovators, and companies-- it allows the market to make independent decisions free from the government to be able to best drive their emission reductions. And this is also, by the way, the chief reason that carbon pricing has received support from leaders and economists on both sides of the aisle in the United States of America. A price on carbon, coupled with government support for innovation in key sectors, is easily one of the most compelling tools for the world to accelerate the clean energy transformation that we are working to achieve. Now, while it may be some time before we see this ideal outcome, the effort to improve carbon markets ought to be a priority going forward. The bottom line is that there are many tools at the world's disposal. The COP itself is an important tool, in a sense. It has become much more of a--much more than just a gathering of government officials. It's really a yearly summit, 25,000 people strong this year from all over the world, for all sectors to showcase their commitment to climate action and to discuss ways to expand shared efforts. It's a regular reminder of exactly how much this movement has grown--and how many people, in how many countries, are committed to action. Walking around the conference here before I was coming in here and seeing this site in Marrakech, and seeing the delegations and the business leaders, the entrepreneurs and the activists who have traveled from near and far to be here, it's abundantly clear we have the ability to prevent the worst impacts of climate change. But again, we're forced to ask: Do we have the collective will? Because our success is not going to happen by accident. It won't happen without sustained commitment, without cooperation and creative thinking. And it won't happen without confident investors and innovative entrepreneurs. And it certainly won't happen without leadership. For those in power in all parts of the world, including my own, who may be confronted with decisions about which road to take at this critical juncture, I ask you, on behalf of billions of people around the world: Don't take my word for it. Don't take just the existence of this COP as the stamp of approval for it. I ask you to see for yourselves. Do your own due diligence before making irrevocable choices. Examine closely what it is that has persuaded the Pope, presidents, and prime ministers all over the world, leaders around the world, to take on the responsibility of responding to this threat. Talk to the business leaders of Fortune 500 companies and smaller innovative companies, all of whom are eager to invest in the energy markets of the future. Get the best economists' judgment on the risk of inaction, of what the cost would be to global economies, versus the opportunities that are to be found in the clean energy market of the future. Speak with the military leaders who view climate change as a global security concern, as a threat multiplier. Ask farmers about--and fisherman about the impact of dramatic changes in weather patterns on their current ability to make a living and to support their families or on what they see for the future. Listen to faith leaders talk about the moral responsibility that human beings have to act as stewards of the planet that we have to share, the only planet we have. Bring in the activists and civil society, groups who have worked for years with communities all over the world to raise awareness and to respond to this threat. Ask young people about their legitimate concerns for the planet that their children will inherit in reducing emissions worldwide. And above all, consult with the scientists who have dedicated their entire lives to expanding our understanding of this challenge, and whose work will be in vain unless we sound the alarm loud enough for everyone to hear. No one has a right to make decisions that affect billions of people based on solely ideology or without proper input. Anyone who has these conversations, who takes the time to learn from these experts, who gets the full picture of what we're facing--I believe they can only come to one legitimate decision, and that is to act boldly on climate change and encourage others to do the same. Now, I want to acknowledge that since this COP started, obviously, an election took place in my country. And I know it has left some here and elsewhere feeling uncertain about the future. I obviously understand that uncertainty. And while I can't stand here and speculate about what policies our president-elect will pursue, I will tell you this: In the time that I have spent in public life, one of the things I have learned is that some issues look a little bit different when you're actually in office compared to when you're on the campaign trail. And the truth is that climate change shouldn't be a partisan issue in the first place. It isn't a partisan issue for our military leaders at the Pentagon who call climate change a threat multiplier. (Applause.) It isn't a partisan issue for those military leaders because of the way that climate change exacerbates conflicts all over the world and who view it as a threat to military [[Page S6706]] readiness at their bases and could suffer the consequences of rising seas and stronger storms. It isn't a partisan issue for our intelligence community, who just this year released a report detailing the implications of climate change for U.S. national security: threats to the stability of fragile nations, heightened social and political tensions, rising food prices, increased risks to human health, and more. It isn't a partisan issue for mayors from New Orleans to Miami, who are already working hard to manage sunny-day floods and stronger storm surges caused by climate change. It isn't partisan for liberal and conservative business leaders alike who are investing unprecedented amounts of money into renewables, voluntarily committing to reduce their own emissions, and even holding their supply chains accountable to their overall carbon footprint. And there's nothing partisan about climate change for the world scientists who are near unanimous in their conclusion that climate change is real, it is happening, human beings for the most part are causing it, and we will have increasing catastrophic impacts on our way of life if we don't take the dramatic steps necessary to reduce the carbon footprint of our civilization. Now, whether we are able to meet this moment is a big test--probably as big a test of courage and vision as you'll ever find. Every nation has a responsibility to do its part if we are going to pass that test--and only those nations who step up and respond to this threat can legitimately lay claim to a mantle of global leadership. That's a fact. More than his love of Marrakech, Winston Churchill was known for his hard-nosed insight and the way that he expressed it. He once argued, tellingly: ``It's not always enough that we do our best; sometimes we have to do what is required.'' We know today what is required. And with all of the real- world evidence, with all of the peer-reviewed science, with all of the plain just old common sense, there isn't anyone who can credibly argue otherwise. So we have to continue this fight, my friends. We have to continue to defy expectations. We have to continue to accelerate the global transition to a clean energy economy. And we have to continue to hold one another accountable for the choices that our nations makes. Earlier this year, on Earth Day, I had the great privilege of signing the Paris Agreement on behalf of President Obama and the United States. It was a special day. And because my daughter lives in New York, I invited her to join me at the UN. She surprised me by bringing my 2-year-old granddaughter, Isabelle, along as well. And that morning, I had been thinking about the history that had brought us to that day. I thought about the first Earth Day in 1970 that I mentioned earlier, when I joined with millions of Americans in teach-ins to educate the public about the environmental challenges we faced. I thought about the first UN climate conference in Rio, which is actually where I met my wife Teresa, and I thought of the urgency that we all felt way back then in 1992. And of course, I thought about that December night at Le Bourget, when it seemed--for the first time--that the world had finally found the path forward. But as I sat and I played with my granddaughter, waiting for my turn to go out and sign the Agreement, I thought, not of the past, but I thought of the future. Her future. The world her children would one day inherit. And when it was time for me to go up on that stage, I scooped her up and I brought her out with me. I wanted to share that moment with her. And I'll never forget it. But to my surprise, people responded to her presence that day, and since then so many people have said to me, they've conveyed to me how that moment conveyed something special and moved them. They told me they thought of their own children, their own grandchildren. They thought of the future. They were reminded of the stakes. Ladies and gentlemen, here in Marrakech, in the next hours, let us make clear to the world that we will always remember the stakes. Let us stand firm in support of the goals that we set in Paris and recommit ourselves to double our efforts to meet them. Let us say that when it comes to climate change, we will commit not just to doing our best, but as Winston Churchill admonished, we will do what is required. I look forward to working with you in this important work for whatever number of years ahead I have a chance to. Thank you. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6702-S6706] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SECRETARY KERRY'S REMARKS AT COP22 Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, last year the world came together in Paris to support a truly historic agreement on climate change. And 2015 was also historic for another reason: It was the hottest year in an observational record that stretches back to the 1880s. In fact, 15 of the 16 hottest years on the planet have occurred since 2000. Recently, July and August 2016 tied the global record for the hottest month, and 2016 is on track to be the warmest year yet. The evidence on climate change is overwhelming. Scientists have understood the fundamental physics for over a century. And the world agrees that we must take action to curb dangerous carbon pollution and reduce the effects of climate change. A majority of the United States agrees that we must take action. The swiftness with which the Paris Climate Accord came into force demonstrates the global commitment to addressing the serious concerns of climate change. It is also a testament to the leadership of President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry. This year, the world again came together at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Marrakesh, Morocco, to begin forging the path towards a lower-emissions world and clean energy future. And while there is much work to be done, we are heading in the right direction. We have seen the price of solar energy reach record lows and the rate of new solar installation reach record highs. We have seen States, regions, and countries reduce their carbon pollution while growing their economies. These positive steps will not only curb carbon pollution, but also create good, well-paying clean energy jobs. Climate change is a challenge for the entire world. Through the Paris Climate Accord, the international community has decided to face this challenge head on, and the United States must continue to be the global leader. [[Page S6703]] Under the leadership of Sectary of State John Kerry, the United States has carried this mantle. In the speech that Secretary Kerry delivered last month in Marrakesh, Morocco, at the 22nd meeting of the Conference of Parties to the United Nationals Framework Convention on Climate Change and first session of the Conference of Parties to the Paris Agreement, Secretary Kerry shared his vision for our future: a brighter, cleaner, healthier and more prosperous one. He said: Thank you so much, everybody. I apologize for being a few moments late. There was a fire and then there was some traffic backed up, and so here I am and here are you, and thank you for being here. Let me begin by thanking our terrific U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Change Jonathan Pershing. I couldn't be luckier than to have him in this job. He was over at the Energy Department for a while. We stole him from Ernie Moniz, who is a great colleague and was gracious in my theft. And he has done a spectacular job working with all of our international partners as we begin the hard work of implementing the Paris Agreement. And I also want to thank Ambassador Jennifer Haverkamp, who, along with Jonathan and a lot of the team that I see sitting here, has done an absolutely terrific job in leading the State Department's efforts to advance our climate goals this year. And I have to tell you--well, let me just divert for a minute. I also want to thank Brian Deese--I don't know if he's here--but I'm grateful for President Obama's senior advisor on climate issues and the entire intrepid U.S. delegation to the COP, whom I had a chance to meet with earlier this morning, but we've kind of traveled this road together. I also thank our international partners, and particularly the executive secretary of the UNFCCC, Patricia Espinosa; the outgoing president of the COP, Minister Segolene Royal of France; and the incoming COP president, my friend and our host this week, Minister Salaheddine Mezouar, the foreign minister of Morocco. And I also want to thank our partners from Fiji, who will serve as president for the next COP, which I intend hopefully to attend as Citizen Kerry. It's a great pleasure for me to be able to be here in Marrakech. I'm reminded of one of the 20th century's most outsized figures whose connection with this city is so famous--Sir Winston Churchill. He loved to paint the landscapes here and to absorb the beauty and the culture. And in fact, at the very height of World War II, as he and President Franklin Roosevelt and Allied leaders gathered in Casablanca to plan the strategy for the European Theater, Churchill was absolutely stunned to learn that Roosevelt had never been to this part of Morocco. So in a move that perhaps only Winston Churchill would get away with in the middle of a global war--world war--Churchill convinced Roosevelt to extend his visit and drive through what was still, at the time, a country engulfed in active combat. So after several hours on the loose, and because we're talking about Winston Churchill, plenty of Scotch-- (laughter)--the two leaders arrived in Marrakech in time to see the sun set on the Atlas Mountains. And Churchill said it was the loveliest view on Earth. So I think it's fitting, therefore, that almost three- quarters of a century later, friends and allies meet again in Marrakech in order to undertake a very important discussion-- a discussion about the natural world that surrounds us and the importance of preserving it for generations to come. As Jonathan mentioned, climate change is deeply personal to me, but it's personal to everyone in this room. I know that. And we obviously want it to be just as personal for everyone in every room: men, women, children, businesspeople, consumers, parents, teachers, students, grandparents. Wherever we live, whatever our calling, whatever our background must be, this is an imperative. Now, I know the danger of preaching to the choir--and, obviously, all of us here are the proverbial choir. But I'm actually grateful for that, because here at the 22nd COP, no one can deny the remarkable progress that we have made-- progress that actually was pretty hard to imagine even a few years ago. The global community is more united than ever not just in accepting the challenge, but in confronting it with real action, in making a difference. And no one should doubt the overwhelming majority of the citizens of the United States who know climate change is happening and who are determined to keep our commitments that were made in Paris. (Applause.) None of us will forget the moment last December at Le Bourget, when the former foreign minister of France, with Segolene and a bunch of you there, led by our friend Laurent Fabius, who gaveled in the strongest, most ambitious global climate agreement ever negotiated. It was an accord that took literally decades to achieve--the proud work product of principled diplomacy, and ultimately, a deeply held, shared understanding that we're all in this together. And when we left Paris, no one rested on their laurels. Instead, the world--unified--moved expeditiously to begin the--to pull the agreement permanently into force, crossing the thresholds of 55 countries representing 55 percent of global emissions, and doing so far faster than even the most optimistic among us might have predicted. In a powerful statement of the whole world's broad commitment to this agreement, in less than a year, 109 countries representing nearly 75 percent of the world's emissions have now formally committed to bold, decisive action--and we are determined to affirm that action and to stick with it out of Marrakech. Now, we have in place--(applause)--so we have in place a foundation, based on national climate goals--109 nations, each of them have come up with their own plan, each of us setting goals that are based on our own abilities and our own circumstances. This agreement is, in fact, the essence of common but differentiated responsibilities. It provides support to countries that need help meeting the targets. It leaves no country to weather the storm of climate change alone. It marshals an array of tools in order to help developing nations to invest in infrastructure, technology, and the science to get the job done. It supports the most vulnerable countries, so they can better adapt to the climate impacts that many of those countries are already confronting. And finally, it enables us to ratchet up ambition over time as technology develops and as the price of clean energy comes down. This is critical: the agreement calls on the parties to revisit their national pledges every five years, in order to ensure that we keep pace with the technology and that we accelerate the global transition to a clean energy economy. This process--a cornerstone of our agreement--gives us a framework that is built to last, and a degree of global accountability that has never before existed. But I want to share with you that the progress that we've made this year goes well beyond Paris. In early October, the International Civil Aviation Organization established a sector-wide agreement for carbon- neutral growth. Why is this so important? Because international aviation wasn't covered by what we did in Paris, and if that aviation was a country, it would rank among the top dozen greenhouse gas emitters in the world. A few weeks later, I was pleased to be in Kigali, Rwanda, when representatives from again nearly 200 countries came together to phase down the global use and production of hydrofluorocarbons--which has been expected to increase very rapidly with a danger that is multiple of times more damaging than carbon dioxide. The Kigali agreement could singlehandedly help us to avoid an entire half a degree centigrade of warming by the end of the century--while at the same time opening up new opportunities for growth in a range of industries. All of these steps combine to move the needle in the direction that we need to. And in large part because global leaders have woken up to the enormity of this challenge, the world is now beginning to move forward together towards a clean energy future. Over the past decade, the global renewable energy market has expanded more than six-fold. Last year, investment in renewable energy was at an all-time high--nearly $350 billion. But that only tells you part of the story. An average of--that 350 billion is the first time that we've been able to see that money outpacing what is being put into fossil fuels. An average of half a million new solar panels were installed every single day last year. And for the first time since the Pre-Industrial Era, despite the fact that you have global prices of oil and gas and coal that are lower than ever, still more of the world's money was invested in renewable energy technologies than in new fossil fuel plants. And like many of you, I've seen this transformation take hold in my own country. That's why I'm confident about the future, regardless of what policy might be chosen, because of the marketplace. I've met with leaders and innovators in the energy industry all across our nation, and I am excited about the path that they are on. America's wind generation has tripled since 2008 and that will continue, and solar generation has increased 30 times over. And the reason both of those will continue is that the marketplace will dictate that, not the government. I can tell you with confidence that the United States is right now, today, on our way to meeting all of the international targets that we've set, and because of the market decisions that are being made, I do not believe that that can or will be reversed. (Applause.) Now, much of this is due to President Obama's leadership, and our Congress also moving in a bipartisan fashion on things like tax credits for renewable energy. This leadership has helped to inspire targeted investment from the private sector. Today our emissions are being driven down because market-based forces are taking hold all over the world. And that's what we said we would do in Paris. None of us pretended that in Paris, the agreement itself was going to achieve two degrees. What we knew is we were sending that critical message to the marketplace, and businesses have responded, as I just described. Most businesspeople have come to understand: investing in clean energy simply makes good economic sense. You can make money. You can do good and do well at the same time. Now, significantly, the renewable energy boom isn't limited to industrialized countries, and that's important to note. In fact, emerging economies like China, India, and Brazil invested even more in renewable technologies last year than the developed world. China alone invested more than 100 billion dollars. Ultimately, clean energy is expected [[Page S6704]] to be a multitrillion dollar market--the largest market the world has ever known. And no nation will do well if it sits on the sidelines, handicapping its new businesses from reaping the benefits of the clean-tech explosion. My friends, we are in the midst of a global renewable energy surge, and as a result, in many places, clean energy has already reached cost parity with fossil fuels. Millions around the world are currently employed by the renewable energy industry. And if we make the right choices, millions more people will be put to work. So good things are happening. The energy curve is bending towards sustainability. The market is clearly headed towards clean energy, and that trend will only become more pronounced. Now, for those of us who have been working on this challenge for decades, this really is a turning point. It is a cause for optimism, notwithstanding what you see in different countries with respect to politics and change. In no uncertain terms, the question now is not whether we will transition to energy economy--to a clean energy economy. That we've already begun to do. The question now is whether or not we are going to have the will to get this job done. That's the question now--whether we will make the transition in time to be able to do what we have to do to prevent catastrophic damage. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm not a Cassandra. You can tell from what I've said. But I'm a realist. Time is not on our side. The world is already changing at an increasingly alarming rate with increasingly alarming consequences. The last time that Morocco hosted the COP was in 2001, and the intervening 15 years have been among the 16 hottest years in recorded history. 2016 is going to be the warmest year of all. Every month so far has broken a record. And this year will contribute its record-breaking heat to the hottest decade in recorded history, which was, by the way, preceded by the second-hottest decade, which was preceded by the third hottest decade. At some point, even the strongest skeptic has to acknowledge that something disturbing is happening. We have seen record-breaking droughts everywhere--from India to Brazil to the west coast of the United States. Storms that used to happen once every 500 years are becoming relatively normal. In recent years, an average of 22.5 million people have been displaced by extreme weather events annually. We never saw that in the 20th Century. Communities in island states like Fiji have already been forced to take steps to relocate permanently, because the places they have called home for generations are now uninhabitable. And there are many, many more who know it's only a matter of time before rising oceans begin to inundate their cities. I know this is a lot for anyone to process--hard to process. That's why I have found that whenever possible, the best way to try to understand and to see whether people are pushing the envelope of thinking on this or not is to see for oneself what is happening. That's why this summer I went to Greenland to visit the incredible Jakobshavn glacier. Scientists pointed out to me the lines many meters above the water today that mark the glacier's retreat which it has done more in the past 15 years than it did in the entire previous century. And while I was there, I boarded a Danish naval vessel and I traveled through the ice fjord. I saw the massive ice chunks that had just broken off from the glacier to melt inexorably into the sea. And because they come off Greenland, which is on rock, every bit of that ice contributes to the rise of the ocean. Since the 1990s, the painful pace of that melting has nearly tripled. Every day, 86 million metric tons of ice makes its way down that fjord into the ocean. And the total flow that comes off that glacier in a single year is enough water to meet the needs of New York City for two decades. But experts in Greenland and elsewhere have always warned me, and they warned me on this trip this summer, if you really want to understand what's happening and what the threat is, go to Antarctica. Nowhere on the planet are the stakes as high as they are on the opposite end of the globe. For half a century, climate scientists have believed the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is a sword of Damocles hanging over our entire way of life. Should it break apart and melt into the sea, it alone could raise global sea levels by four to five meters. And the scientists down there described to me how the pressure of the ice and the weight of the ice pushes the entire continent down so that it's grounded on the base of Earth's crust and rock. But that allows warmer sea water to creep in under the glacier and speed up the process of the melting and destabilize the glacier. Antarctica contains ice sheets that are, in some places, on the East Antarctic Ice Sheet three miles deep. And if all that ice were somehow able to melt away completely because we are irresponsible about climate change, in the coming centuries, sea level would rise somewhere over 100 to 200 feet. That's why I flew last week to McMurdo Station in Antarctica to meet with our scientists and to understand better what is taking place. I flew by helicopter over the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. I walked out onto the Ross Sea ice shelf. And I talked with the scientists who are on the front lines, not people involved in day to day politics, but people who are making scientific judgment and doing extensive research. And they were crystal clear: The more they learn, the more alarmed they become about the speed with which these changes are happening. A scientist from New Zealand named Gavin Dunbar described what they're seeing there as the quote, ``canary in the coal mine'' and warned that some thresholds, if we cross them, cannot be reversed. In other words, we can't wait too long to translate the science that we have today into the policies that are necessary to address this challenge. These scientists urged me to remind my own government and governments around the world and everyone here that what we do right now--today-- matters, because if we don't go far enough and if we don't go fast enough, the damage we inflict could take centuries to undo--if it can be undone at all. I underscore today: We don't get a second chance. The consequences of failure would in most cases be irreversible. And if we lose this moment for action, there's no speech decades from now that will put these massive ice sheets back together. There's no magic wand in any capital in the world that you can wave to refill all of the lakes and rivers that will dry up, or make farm--arid farm land fertile again. And we certainly won't have the power to hold back rising tides as they encroach on our shores. So we have to get this right, and we have to get it right now. The scientists in Antarctica told me that they are still trying to figure out how quickly this is all happening. But they know for certain that it's happening, and it's happening faster than we previously thought possible. The alarm bells ought to be going off everywhere. As an American glacial geologist told me down there, a fellow by the name of John Stone, he said, ``The catastrophic period could already be underway.'' That's why wise public policy demands that we take precautionary measures now. Still, despite the real-life changes that are being done and the threat of more to come, it's important to remind ourselves that we are not on a pre-ordained path to disaster. This is not pre-ordained. It's not written in the stars. This is about choices--choices that we still have. This is a test of willpower, not capacity. It's within our power to put the planet back on a better track. But doing that requires holding ourselves accountable to the hard truth. It requires holding ourselves accountable to facts, not opinion; to science, not theories that haven't been proven and can't be proven; and certainly not to political bromides and slogans. For all the progress that we are making, at the current pace we will not meet our goal. I said that earlier. We knew in Paris that what we were doing was trying to start down a road. But we also knew it doesn't get us to the end of the journey. Yes, renewables make up more than half of all the new electricity installation last year. That's progress. But the reality is because of the existing energy infrastructure already in place, that new energy only generated a little more than 10 percent of the world's total energy. That is nowhere near what we need in order to achieve our goals. If we're going to have the ability to stave off the worst impacts of climate change, we have to dramatically accelerate the transition that is already starting. We need to get to a point where clean sources are generating most of the world's energy, and we need to get there fast. Certainly experts tell us by the middle of this century we have to get there. Now, I've said many times, and I'll say it again today: It is not going to be governments alone, or even principally, that solve the climate challenge. The private sector is the most important player. And already we are seeing real solutions coming from entrepreneurs and academia. It's going to be innovators, workers, and business leaders, many of whom have been hammering away at this challenge for years who are going to continue to create the technological advances that forever revolutionize the way that we power our world. But make no mistake, government leadership is absolutely essential. And because today is the last opportunity I will have to address the COP as Secretary of State, I just want to take a moment to underscore the work that government leaders can do and should do, especially the 200--almost 200 nations represented here. Now, we know that we have not come to Marrakech to bask in the glow of Paris. We've come here to move forward. In doing so, we cannot forget that the contributions we've each made thus far were never meant to be the ceiling. They're a foundation on which we expect to build. And unless our nations voluntarily ratchet up our ambition, and unless we continue to put sustained pressure on one another to act wisely, we will have difficulty meeting the current mitigation needs, let alone holding temperature increases at 2 degrees warming, which science tells us is a tipping point. And if we fall short, it will be the single greatest instance in modern history of a generation in a time of crisis abdicating responsibility for the future. And it won't just be a policy failure; because of the nature of this challenge, it will be a moral failure, a betrayal of devastating consequence. Now, I know not--that's not what any of us here signed up for. As Pope Francis said, ``We receive this world as an inheritance from past generations, but also as a loan for future generations, to whom we will have to return it.'' Now, I fully recognize the challenges that a number of countries face because they have a big population, they have a growing economy, they have a lot of people in poverty, [[Page S6705]] they're determined to maintain stability and pull those people into the economy. And of course, they're concerned about stability--we all are. Access to affordable energy is a key part of providing that stability. And the dirtiest sources of energy are, unfortunately, some of the cheapest. But I emphasize this: Only in the short term. In the long term, it's an entirely different story, folks. In the long term, carbon-intensive energy is actually today, right now, one of the costliest and most foolhardy investments any nation can possibly make. And that is because the final invoice for carbon-based energy includes a lot more than just the price of the oil or the coal, or the natural gas; it--or the price of building the power plant. The real cost accounting needs to fully consider all of the downstream consequences, which, in the case of dirty fuels, are enough to at least double or triple the initial expenses. That's the kind of accounting that we need to do today. Just think about the price of environmental and agricultural degradation. Think about the loss of an ability of farmers in one area because of the lack of water or too much heat to be able to grow their crops today. Think of the hospital bills for asthma and emphysema patients, and the millions of deaths that are linked to air pollution caused by the use of fossil fuels. In 2014, a study found that up to six million people in China have black lung because they lived and worked so close to coal-fired power plants. There are nearly 20 million new asthma cases a year in India linked to coal-related air pollution, and in the United States, asthma costs taxpayers more than $55 billion annually. The greatest cause of children being hospitalized in the summer in the United States is environmentally induced asthma. These are real costs, and they need to be added to the tally. We also have to include the price tag of rebuilding after devastating storms and flooding. Just in the first three quarters of this year alone, extreme weather events have cost the United States--have cost American taxpayers $27 billion in damage. In August alone, Louisiana experienced flooding that resulted in roughly $10 billion worth of damage. So none of us can afford to be oblivious to these expenses, and these initial costs are in reality just a glimpse of what the future could hold in store for us if we fail to respond. Just imagine: Sea barriers that have to be built. Go down to Miami--in south Miami, they're building--they're raising streets to deal with flooding that's already occurring, building new storm drains and assessing people additional tax in order to do it. Massive increases in cost of maintaining infrastructure to control flooding, withstand storms. Power outages. All of this and more has to be added to any honest assessment of high-carbon energy sources. And in an age of increasing transparency and public demand for accountability, citizens in the long run will not accept phony accounting or an obfuscation of the consequences of the decisions. So everyone needs to make smarter choices--with the long game, not the short game, in mind. Coal, unfortunately, is the single biggest contributor to global carbon pollution. It provides about 30 percent of the world's energy, but it produces nearly 50 percent of the world's greenhouse gases. The unprecedented investments that we are now seeing in clean energy will mean very, very little if, at the same time, new coal fire plants without carbon capture are coming online and at a rate dumping into the atmosphere more and more of the very pollution that we're all working so hard to reduce. Some of these projections, I have to tell you, are deeply troubling. For example, between now and 2040, the demand for electricity in Southeast Asia is likely to triple--and the bulk of that demand is currently expected to be met by growth--where? In the coal-fired power sector, rather than clean energy. That threatens everything we're trying to achieve here. We literally cannot use one hand to pat ourselves on the back for what we've done to take steps to address climate change, and then turn around and use the other hand to write a big fat check enabling the widespread development of the dirtiest source of fuel in an outdated way. It just doesn't make sense. That's suicide. And that's how we all lose this fight. Make no mistake: People all over the world are working for victory in this. And this issue is increasingly capturing the attention of citizens everywhere, and certainly the private sector. The private sector welcomed the signals that we sent in Paris, but they are demanding even stronger signals now-- the private sector--so that they can invest clean energy solutions with even greater confidence. One of the strongest signals that government can send, one of the most powerful ways to reduce emissions at the lowest possible course--cost--is to move toward carbon pricing that puts basic, free-market economics to work in addressing this challenge. Now obviously, this is not a new idea. Many have come to this conclusion already. The share of global emissions that are covered by a carbon price has tripled over the last decade. Last year, more than 1,000 businesses and investors-- including sectors that might be surprising to some of you-- all came together to voice their support for carbon pricing. The long list of supporters includes energy companies like BP, Royal Dutch Shell, utilities like PG&E, transportation companies like British Airways, construction firms like Cemex, financial institutions like Deutsche Bank, like Swiss Re, and consumer goods corporations like Unilever and Nokia. These companies all believe that carbon pricing will establish the necessary certainty in the marketplace that helps the private sector to move the capital that helps to solve the problem. Carbon pricing allows citizens, innovators, and companies-- it allows the market to make independent decisions free from the government to be able to best drive their emission reductions. And this is also, by the way, the chief reason that carbon pricing has received support from leaders and economists on both sides of the aisle in the United States of America. A price on carbon, coupled with government support for innovation in key sectors, is easily one of the most compelling tools for the world to accelerate the clean energy transformation that we are working to achieve. Now, while it may be some time before we see this ideal outcome, the effort to improve carbon markets ought to be a priority going forward. The bottom line is that there are many tools at the world's disposal. The COP itself is an important tool, in a sense. It has become much more of a--much more than just a gathering of government officials. It's really a yearly summit, 25,000 people strong this year from all over the world, for all sectors to showcase their commitment to climate action and to discuss ways to expand shared efforts. It's a regular reminder of exactly how much this movement has grown--and how many people, in how many countries, are committed to action. Walking around the conference here before I was coming in here and seeing this site in Marrakech, and seeing the delegations and the business leaders, the entrepreneurs and the activists who have traveled from near and far to be here, it's abundantly clear we have the ability to prevent the worst impacts of climate change. But again, we're forced to ask: Do we have the collective will? Because our success is not going to happen by accident. It won't happen without sustained commitment, without cooperation and creative thinking. And it won't happen without confident investors and innovative entrepreneurs. And it certainly won't happen without leadership. For those in power in all parts of the world, including my own, who may be confronted with decisions about which road to take at this critical juncture, I ask you, on behalf of billions of people around the world: Don't take my word for it. Don't take just the existence of this COP as the stamp of approval for it. I ask you to see for yourselves. Do your own due diligence before making irrevocable choices. Examine closely what it is that has persuaded the Pope, presidents, and prime ministers all over the world, leaders around the world, to take on the responsibility of responding to this threat. Talk to the business leaders of Fortune 500 companies and smaller innovative companies, all of whom are eager to invest in the energy markets of the future. Get the best economists' judgment on the risk of inaction, of what the cost would be to global economies, versus the opportunities that are to be found in the clean energy market of the future. Speak with the military leaders who view climate change as a global security concern, as a threat multiplier. Ask farmers about--and fisherman about the impact of dramatic changes in weather patterns on their current ability to make a living and to support their families or on what they see for the future. Listen to faith leaders talk about the moral responsibility that human beings have to act as stewards of the planet that we have to share, the only planet we have. Bring in the activists and civil society, groups who have worked for years with communities all over the world to raise awareness and to respond to this threat. Ask young people about their legitimate concerns for the planet that their children will inherit in reducing emissions worldwide. And above all, consult with the scientists who have dedicated their entire lives to expanding our understanding of this challenge, and whose work will be in vain unless we sound the alarm loud enough for everyone to hear. No one has a right to make decisions that affect billions of people based on solely ideology or without proper input. Anyone who has these conversations, who takes the time to learn from these experts, who gets the full picture of what we're facing--I believe they can only come to one legitimate decision, and that is to act boldly on climate change and encourage others to do the same. Now, I want to acknowledge that since this COP started, obviously, an election took place in my country. And I know it has left some here and elsewhere feeling uncertain about the future. I obviously understand that uncertainty. And while I can't stand here and speculate about what policies our president-elect will pursue, I will tell you this: In the time that I have spent in public life, one of the things I have learned is that some issues look a little bit different when you're actually in office compared to when you're on the campaign trail. And the truth is that climate change shouldn't be a partisan issue in the first place. It isn't a partisan issue for our military leaders at the Pentagon who call climate change a threat multiplier. (Applause.) It isn't a partisan issue for those military leaders because of the way that climate change exacerbates conflicts all over the world and who view it as a threat to military [[Page S6706]] readiness at their bases and could suffer the consequences of rising seas and stronger storms. It isn't a partisan issue for our intelligence community, who just this year released a report detailing the implications of climate change for U.S. national security: threats to the stability of fragile nations, heightened social and political tensions, rising food prices, increased risks to human health, and more. It isn't a partisan issue for mayors from New Orleans to Miami, who are already working hard to manage sunny-day floods and stronger storm surges caused by climate change. It isn't partisan for liberal and conservative business leaders alike who are investing unprecedented amounts of money into renewables, voluntarily committing to reduce their own emissions, and even holding their supply chains accountable to their overall carbon footprint. And there's nothing partisan about climate change for the world scientists who are near unanimous in their conclusion that climate change is real, it is happening, human beings for the most part are causing it, and we will have increasing catastrophic impacts on our way of life if we don't take the dramatic steps necessary to reduce the carbon footprint of our civilization. Now, whether we are able to meet this moment is a big test--probably as big a test of courage and vision as you'll ever find. Every nation has a responsibility to do its part if we are going to pass that test--and only those nations who step up and respond to this threat can legitimately lay claim to a mantle of global leadership. That's a fact. More than his love of Marrakech, Winston Churchill was known for his hard-nosed insight and the way that he expressed it. He once argued, tellingly: ``It's not always enough that we do our best; sometimes we have to do what is required.'' We know today what is required. And with all of the real- world evidence, with all of the peer-reviewed science, with all of the plain just old common sense, there isn't anyone who can credibly argue otherwise. So we have to continue this fight, my friends. We have to continue to defy expectations. We have to continue to accelerate the global transition to a clean energy economy. And we have to continue to hold one another accountable for the choices that our nations makes. Earlier this year, on Earth Day, I had the great privilege of signing the Paris Agreement on behalf of President Obama and the United States. It was a special day. And because my daughter lives in New York, I invited her to join me at the UN. She surprised me by bringing my 2-year-old granddaughter, Isabelle, along as well. And that morning, I had been thinking about the history that had brought us to that day. I thought about the first Earth Day in 1970 that I mentioned earlier, when I joined with millions of Americans in teach-ins to educate the public about the environmental challenges we faced. I thought about the first UN climate conference in Rio, which is actually where I met my wife Teresa, and I thought of the urgency that we all felt way back then in 1992. And of course, I thought about that December night at Le Bourget, when it seemed--for the first time--that the world had finally found the path forward. But as I sat and I played with my granddaughter, waiting for my turn to go out and sign the Agreement, I thought, not of the past, but I thought of the future. Her future. The world her children would one day inherit. And when it was time for me to go up on that stage, I scooped her up and I brought her out with me. I wanted to share that moment with her. And I'll never forget it. But to my surprise, people responded to her presence that day, and since then so many people have said to me, they've conveyed to me how that moment conveyed something special and moved them. They told me they thought of their own children, their own grandchildren. They thought of the future. They were reminded of the stakes. Ladies and gentlemen, here in Marrakech, in the next hours, let us make clear to the world that we will always remember the stakes. Let us stand firm in support of the goals that we set in Paris and recommit ourselves to double our efforts to meet them. Let us say that when it comes to climate change, we will commit not just to doing our best, but as Winston Churchill admonished, we will do what is required. I look forward to working with you in this important work for whatever number of years ahead I have a chance to. Thank you. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6702-S6706] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SECRETARY KERRY'S REMARKS AT COP22 Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, last year the world came together in Paris to support a truly historic agreement on climate change. And 2015 was also historic for another reason: It was the hottest year in an observational record that stretches back to the 1880s. In fact, 15 of the 16 hottest years on the planet have occurred since 2000. Recently, July and August 2016 tied the global record for the hottest month, and 2016 is on track to be the warmest year yet. The evidence on climate change is overwhelming. Scientists have understood the fundamental physics for over a century. And the world agrees that we must take action to curb dangerous carbon pollution and reduce the effects of climate change. A majority of the United States agrees that we must take action. The swiftness with which the Paris Climate Accord came into force demonstrates the global commitment to addressing the serious concerns of climate change. It is also a testament to the leadership of President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry. This year, the world again came together at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Marrakesh, Morocco, to begin forging the path towards a lower-emissions world and clean energy future. And while there is much work to be done, we are heading in the right direction. We have seen the price of solar energy reach record lows and the rate of new solar installation reach record highs. We have seen States, regions, and countries reduce their carbon pollution while growing their economies. These positive steps will not only curb carbon pollution, but also create good, well-paying clean energy jobs. Climate change is a challenge for the entire world. Through the Paris Climate Accord, the international community has decided to face this challenge head on, and the United States must continue to be the global leader. [[Page S6703]] Under the leadership of Sectary of State John Kerry, the United States has carried this mantle. In the speech that Secretary Kerry delivered last month in Marrakesh, Morocco, at the 22nd meeting of the Conference of Parties to the United Nationals Framework Convention on Climate Change and first session of the Conference of Parties to the Paris Agreement, Secretary Kerry shared his vision for our future: a brighter, cleaner, healthier and more prosperous one. He said: Thank you so much, everybody. I apologize for being a few moments late. There was a fire and then there was some traffic backed up, and so here I am and here are you, and thank you for being here. Let me begin by thanking our terrific U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Change Jonathan Pershing. I couldn't be luckier than to have him in this job. He was over at the Energy Department for a while. We stole him from Ernie Moniz, who is a great colleague and was gracious in my theft. And he has done a spectacular job working with all of our international partners as we begin the hard work of implementing the Paris Agreement. And I also want to thank Ambassador Jennifer Haverkamp, who, along with Jonathan and a lot of the team that I see sitting here, has done an absolutely terrific job in leading the State Department's efforts to advance our climate goals this year. And I have to tell you--well, let me just divert for a minute. I also want to thank Brian Deese--I don't know if he's here--but I'm grateful for President Obama's senior advisor on climate issues and the entire intrepid U.S. delegation to the COP, whom I had a chance to meet with earlier this morning, but we've kind of traveled this road together. I also thank our international partners, and particularly the executive secretary of the UNFCCC, Patricia Espinosa; the outgoing president of the COP, Minister Segolene Royal of France; and the incoming COP president, my friend and our host this week, Minister Salaheddine Mezouar, the foreign minister of Morocco. And I also want to thank our partners from Fiji, who will serve as president for the next COP, which I intend hopefully to attend as Citizen Kerry. It's a great pleasure for me to be able to be here in Marrakech. I'm reminded of one of the 20th century's most outsized figures whose connection with this city is so famous--Sir Winston Churchill. He loved to paint the landscapes here and to absorb the beauty and the culture. And in fact, at the very height of World War II, as he and President Franklin Roosevelt and Allied leaders gathered in Casablanca to plan the strategy for the European Theater, Churchill was absolutely stunned to learn that Roosevelt had never been to this part of Morocco. So in a move that perhaps only Winston Churchill would get away with in the middle of a global war--world war--Churchill convinced Roosevelt to extend his visit and drive through what was still, at the time, a country engulfed in active combat. So after several hours on the loose, and because we're talking about Winston Churchill, plenty of Scotch-- (laughter)--the two leaders arrived in Marrakech in time to see the sun set on the Atlas Mountains. And Churchill said it was the loveliest view on Earth. So I think it's fitting, therefore, that almost three- quarters of a century later, friends and allies meet again in Marrakech in order to undertake a very important discussion-- a discussion about the natural world that surrounds us and the importance of preserving it for generations to come. As Jonathan mentioned, climate change is deeply personal to me, but it's personal to everyone in this room. I know that. And we obviously want it to be just as personal for everyone in every room: men, women, children, businesspeople, consumers, parents, teachers, students, grandparents. Wherever we live, whatever our calling, whatever our background must be, this is an imperative. Now, I know the danger of preaching to the choir--and, obviously, all of us here are the proverbial choir. But I'm actually grateful for that, because here at the 22nd COP, no one can deny the remarkable progress that we have made-- progress that actually was pretty hard to imagine even a few years ago. The global community is more united than ever not just in accepting the challenge, but in confronting it with real action, in making a difference. And no one should doubt the overwhelming majority of the citizens of the United States who know climate change is happening and who are determined to keep our commitments that were made in Paris. (Applause.) None of us will forget the moment last December at Le Bourget, when the former foreign minister of France, with Segolene and a bunch of you there, led by our friend Laurent Fabius, who gaveled in the strongest, most ambitious global climate agreement ever negotiated. It was an accord that took literally decades to achieve--the proud work product of principled diplomacy, and ultimately, a deeply held, shared understanding that we're all in this together. And when we left Paris, no one rested on their laurels. Instead, the world--unified--moved expeditiously to begin the--to pull the agreement permanently into force, crossing the thresholds of 55 countries representing 55 percent of global emissions, and doing so far faster than even the most optimistic among us might have predicted. In a powerful statement of the whole world's broad commitment to this agreement, in less than a year, 109 countries representing nearly 75 percent of the world's emissions have now formally committed to bold, decisive action--and we are determined to affirm that action and to stick with it out of Marrakech. Now, we have in place--(applause)--so we have in place a foundation, based on national climate goals--109 nations, each of them have come up with their own plan, each of us setting goals that are based on our own abilities and our own circumstances. This agreement is, in fact, the essence of common but differentiated responsibilities. It provides support to countries that need help meeting the targets. It leaves no country to weather the storm of climate change alone. It marshals an array of tools in order to help developing nations to invest in infrastructure, technology, and the science to get the job done. It supports the most vulnerable countries, so they can better adapt to the climate impacts that many of those countries are already confronting. And finally, it enables us to ratchet up ambition over time as technology develops and as the price of clean energy comes down. This is critical: the agreement calls on the parties to revisit their national pledges every five years, in order to ensure that we keep pace with the technology and that we accelerate the global transition to a clean energy economy. This process--a cornerstone of our agreement--gives us a framework that is built to last, and a degree of global accountability that has never before existed. But I want to share with you that the progress that we've made this year goes well beyond Paris. In early October, the International Civil Aviation Organization established a sector-wide agreement for carbon- neutral growth. Why is this so important? Because international aviation wasn't covered by what we did in Paris, and if that aviation was a country, it would rank among the top dozen greenhouse gas emitters in the world. A few weeks later, I was pleased to be in Kigali, Rwanda, when representatives from again nearly 200 countries came together to phase down the global use and production of hydrofluorocarbons--which has been expected to increase very rapidly with a danger that is multiple of times more damaging than carbon dioxide. The Kigali agreement could singlehandedly help us to avoid an entire half a degree centigrade of warming by the end of the century--while at the same time opening up new opportunities for growth in a range of industries. All of these steps combine to move the needle in the direction that we need to. And in large part because global leaders have woken up to the enormity of this challenge, the world is now beginning to move forward together towards a clean energy future. Over the past decade, the global renewable energy market has expanded more than six-fold. Last year, investment in renewable energy was at an all-time high--nearly $350 billion. But that only tells you part of the story. An average of--that 350 billion is the first time that we've been able to see that money outpacing what is being put into fossil fuels. An average of half a million new solar panels were installed every single day last year. And for the first time since the Pre-Industrial Era, despite the fact that you have global prices of oil and gas and coal that are lower than ever, still more of the world's money was invested in renewable energy technologies than in new fossil fuel plants. And like many of you, I've seen this transformation take hold in my own country. That's why I'm confident about the future, regardless of what policy might be chosen, because of the marketplace. I've met with leaders and innovators in the energy industry all across our nation, and I am excited about the path that they are on. America's wind generation has tripled since 2008 and that will continue, and solar generation has increased 30 times over. And the reason both of those will continue is that the marketplace will dictate that, not the government. I can tell you with confidence that the United States is right now, today, on our way to meeting all of the international targets that we've set, and because of the market decisions that are being made, I do not believe that that can or will be reversed. (Applause.) Now, much of this is due to President Obama's leadership, and our Congress also moving in a bipartisan fashion on things like tax credits for renewable energy. This leadership has helped to inspire targeted investment from the private sector. Today our emissions are being driven down because market-based forces are taking hold all over the world. And that's what we said we would do in Paris. None of us pretended that in Paris, the agreement itself was going to achieve two degrees. What we knew is we were sending that critical message to the marketplace, and businesses have responded, as I just described. Most businesspeople have come to understand: investing in clean energy simply makes good economic sense. You can make money. You can do good and do well at the same time. Now, significantly, the renewable energy boom isn't limited to industrialized countries, and that's important to note. In fact, emerging economies like China, India, and Brazil invested even more in renewable technologies last year than the developed world. China alone invested more than 100 billion dollars. Ultimately, clean energy is expected [[Page S6704]] to be a multitrillion dollar market--the largest market the world has ever known. And no nation will do well if it sits on the sidelines, handicapping its new businesses from reaping the benefits of the clean-tech explosion. My friends, we are in the midst of a global renewable energy surge, and as a result, in many places, clean energy has already reached cost parity with fossil fuels. Millions around the world are currently employed by the renewable energy industry. And if we make the right choices, millions more people will be put to work. So good things are happening. The energy curve is bending towards sustainability. The market is clearly headed towards clean energy, and that trend will only become more pronounced. Now, for those of us who have been working on this challenge for decades, this really is a turning point. It is a cause for optimism, notwithstanding what you see in different countries with respect to politics and change. In no uncertain terms, the question now is not whether we will transition to energy economy--to a clean energy economy. That we've already begun to do. The question now is whether or not we are going to have the will to get this job done. That's the question now--whether we will make the transition in time to be able to do what we have to do to prevent catastrophic damage. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm not a Cassandra. You can tell from what I've said. But I'm a realist. Time is not on our side. The world is already changing at an increasingly alarming rate with increasingly alarming consequences. The last time that Morocco hosted the COP was in 2001, and the intervening 15 years have been among the 16 hottest years in recorded history. 2016 is going to be the warmest year of all. Every month so far has broken a record. And this year will contribute its record-breaking heat to the hottest decade in recorded history, which was, by the way, preceded by the second-hottest decade, which was preceded by the third hottest decade. At some point, even the strongest skeptic has to acknowledge that something disturbing is happening. We have seen record-breaking droughts everywhere--from India to Brazil to the west coast of the United States. Storms that used to happen once every 500 years are becoming relatively normal. In recent years, an average of 22.5 million people have been displaced by extreme weather events annually. We never saw that in the 20th Century. Communities in island states like Fiji have already been forced to take steps to relocate permanently, because the places they have called home for generations are now uninhabitable. And there are many, many more who know it's only a matter of time before rising oceans begin to inundate their cities. I know this is a lot for anyone to process--hard to process. That's why I have found that whenever possible, the best way to try to understand and to see whether people are pushing the envelope of thinking on this or not is to see for oneself what is happening. That's why this summer I went to Greenland to visit the incredible Jakobshavn glacier. Scientists pointed out to me the lines many meters above the water today that mark the glacier's retreat which it has done more in the past 15 years than it did in the entire previous century. And while I was there, I boarded a Danish naval vessel and I traveled through the ice fjord. I saw the massive ice chunks that had just broken off from the glacier to melt inexorably into the sea. And because they come off Greenland, which is on rock, every bit of that ice contributes to the rise of the ocean. Since the 1990s, the painful pace of that melting has nearly tripled. Every day, 86 million metric tons of ice makes its way down that fjord into the ocean. And the total flow that comes off that glacier in a single year is enough water to meet the needs of New York City for two decades. But experts in Greenland and elsewhere have always warned me, and they warned me on this trip this summer, if you really want to understand what's happening and what the threat is, go to Antarctica. Nowhere on the planet are the stakes as high as they are on the opposite end of the globe. For half a century, climate scientists have believed the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is a sword of Damocles hanging over our entire way of life. Should it break apart and melt into the sea, it alone could raise global sea levels by four to five meters. And the scientists down there described to me how the pressure of the ice and the weight of the ice pushes the entire continent down so that it's grounded on the base of Earth's crust and rock. But that allows warmer sea water to creep in under the glacier and speed up the process of the melting and destabilize the glacier. Antarctica contains ice sheets that are, in some places, on the East Antarctic Ice Sheet three miles deep. And if all that ice were somehow able to melt away completely because we are irresponsible about climate change, in the coming centuries, sea level would rise somewhere over 100 to 200 feet. That's why I flew last week to McMurdo Station in Antarctica to meet with our scientists and to understand better what is taking place. I flew by helicopter over the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. I walked out onto the Ross Sea ice shelf. And I talked with the scientists who are on the front lines, not people involved in day to day politics, but people who are making scientific judgment and doing extensive research. And they were crystal clear: The more they learn, the more alarmed they become about the speed with which these changes are happening. A scientist from New Zealand named Gavin Dunbar described what they're seeing there as the quote, ``canary in the coal mine'' and warned that some thresholds, if we cross them, cannot be reversed. In other words, we can't wait too long to translate the science that we have today into the policies that are necessary to address this challenge. These scientists urged me to remind my own government and governments around the world and everyone here that what we do right now--today-- matters, because if we don't go far enough and if we don't go fast enough, the damage we inflict could take centuries to undo--if it can be undone at all. I underscore today: We don't get a second chance. The consequences of failure would in most cases be irreversible. And if we lose this moment for action, there's no speech decades from now that will put these massive ice sheets back together. There's no magic wand in any capital in the world that you can wave to refill all of the lakes and rivers that will dry up, or make farm--arid farm land fertile again. And we certainly won't have the power to hold back rising tides as they encroach on our shores. So we have to get this right, and we have to get it right now. The scientists in Antarctica told me that they are still trying to figure out how quickly this is all happening. But they know for certain that it's happening, and it's happening faster than we previously thought possible. The alarm bells ought to be going off everywhere. As an American glacial geologist told me down there, a fellow by the name of John Stone, he said, ``The catastrophic period could already be underway.'' That's why wise public policy demands that we take precautionary measures now. Still, despite the real-life changes that are being done and the threat of more to come, it's important to remind ourselves that we are not on a pre-ordained path to disaster. This is not pre-ordained. It's not written in the stars. This is about choices--choices that we still have. This is a test of willpower, not capacity. It's within our power to put the planet back on a better track. But doing that requires holding ourselves accountable to the hard truth. It requires holding ourselves accountable to facts, not opinion; to science, not theories that haven't been proven and can't be proven; and certainly not to political bromides and slogans. For all the progress that we are making, at the current pace we will not meet our goal. I said that earlier. We knew in Paris that what we were doing was trying to start down a road. But we also knew it doesn't get us to the end of the journey. Yes, renewables make up more than half of all the new electricity installation last year. That's progress. But the reality is because of the existing energy infrastructure already in place, that new energy only generated a little more than 10 percent of the world's total energy. That is nowhere near what we need in order to achieve our goals. If we're going to have the ability to stave off the worst impacts of climate change, we have to dramatically accelerate the transition that is already starting. We need to get to a point where clean sources are generating most of the world's energy, and we need to get there fast. Certainly experts tell us by the middle of this century we have to get there. Now, I've said many times, and I'll say it again today: It is not going to be governments alone, or even principally, that solve the climate challenge. The private sector is the most important player. And already we are seeing real solutions coming from entrepreneurs and academia. It's going to be innovators, workers, and business leaders, many of whom have been hammering away at this challenge for years who are going to continue to create the technological advances that forever revolutionize the way that we power our world. But make no mistake, government leadership is absolutely essential. And because today is the last opportunity I will have to address the COP as Secretary of State, I just want to take a moment to underscore the work that government leaders can do and should do, especially the 200--almost 200 nations represented here. Now, we know that we have not come to Marrakech to bask in the glow of Paris. We've come here to move forward. In doing so, we cannot forget that the contributions we've each made thus far were never meant to be the ceiling. They're a foundation on which we expect to build. And unless our nations voluntarily ratchet up our ambition, and unless we continue to put sustained pressure on one another to act wisely, we will have difficulty meeting the current mitigation needs, let alone holding temperature increases at 2 degrees warming, which science tells us is a tipping point. And if we fall short, it will be the single greatest instance in modern history of a generation in a time of crisis abdicating responsibility for the future. And it won't just be a policy failure; because of the nature of this challenge, it will be a moral failure, a betrayal of devastating consequence. Now, I know not--that's not what any of us here signed up for. As Pope Francis said, ``We receive this world as an inheritance from past generations, but also as a loan for future generations, to whom we will have to return it.'' Now, I fully recognize the challenges that a number of countries face because they have a big population, they have a growing economy, they have a lot of people in poverty, [[Page S6705]] they're determined to maintain stability and pull those people into the economy. And of course, they're concerned about stability--we all are. Access to affordable energy is a key part of providing that stability. And the dirtiest sources of energy are, unfortunately, some of the cheapest. But I emphasize this: Only in the short term. In the long term, it's an entirely different story, folks. In the long term, carbon-intensive energy is actually today, right now, one of the costliest and most foolhardy investments any nation can possibly make. And that is because the final invoice for carbon-based energy includes a lot more than just the price of the oil or the coal, or the natural gas; it--or the price of building the power plant. The real cost accounting needs to fully consider all of the downstream consequences, which, in the case of dirty fuels, are enough to at least double or triple the initial expenses. That's the kind of accounting that we need to do today. Just think about the price of environmental and agricultural degradation. Think about the loss of an ability of farmers in one area because of the lack of water or too much heat to be able to grow their crops today. Think of the hospital bills for asthma and emphysema patients, and the millions of deaths that are linked to air pollution caused by the use of fossil fuels. In 2014, a study found that up to six million people in China have black lung because they lived and worked so close to coal-fired power plants. There are nearly 20 million new asthma cases a year in India linked to coal-related air pollution, and in the United States, asthma costs taxpayers more than $55 billion annually. The greatest cause of children being hospitalized in the summer in the United States is environmentally induced asthma. These are real costs, and they need to be added to the tally. We also have to include the price tag of rebuilding after devastating storms and flooding. Just in the first three quarters of this year alone, extreme weather events have cost the United States--have cost American taxpayers $27 billion in damage. In August alone, Louisiana experienced flooding that resulted in roughly $10 billion worth of damage. So none of us can afford to be oblivious to these expenses, and these initial costs are in reality just a glimpse of what the future could hold in store for us if we fail to respond. Just imagine: Sea barriers that have to be built. Go down to Miami--in south Miami, they're building--they're raising streets to deal with flooding that's already occurring, building new storm drains and assessing people additional tax in order to do it. Massive increases in cost of maintaining infrastructure to control flooding, withstand storms. Power outages. All of this and more has to be added to any honest assessment of high-carbon energy sources. And in an age of increasing transparency and public demand for accountability, citizens in the long run will not accept phony accounting or an obfuscation of the consequences of the decisions. So everyone needs to make smarter choices--with the long game, not the short game, in mind. Coal, unfortunately, is the single biggest contributor to global carbon pollution. It provides about 30 percent of the world's energy, but it produces nearly 50 percent of the world's greenhouse gases. The unprecedented investments that we are now seeing in clean energy will mean very, very little if, at the same time, new coal fire plants without carbon capture are coming online and at a rate dumping into the atmosphere more and more of the very pollution that we're all working so hard to reduce. Some of these projections, I have to tell you, are deeply troubling. For example, between now and 2040, the demand for electricity in Southeast Asia is likely to triple--and the bulk of that demand is currently expected to be met by growth--where? In the coal-fired power sector, rather than clean energy. That threatens everything we're trying to achieve here. We literally cannot use one hand to pat ourselves on the back for what we've done to take steps to address climate change, and then turn around and use the other hand to write a big fat check enabling the widespread development of the dirtiest source of fuel in an outdated way. It just doesn't make sense. That's suicide. And that's how we all lose this fight. Make no mistake: People all over the world are working for victory in this. And this issue is increasingly capturing the attention of citizens everywhere, and certainly the private sector. The private sector welcomed the signals that we sent in Paris, but they are demanding even stronger signals now-- the private sector--so that they can invest clean energy solutions with even greater confidence. One of the strongest signals that government can send, one of the most powerful ways to reduce emissions at the lowest possible course--cost--is to move toward carbon pricing that puts basic, free-market economics to work in addressing this challenge. Now obviously, this is not a new idea. Many have come to this conclusion already. The share of global emissions that are covered by a carbon price has tripled over the last decade. Last year, more than 1,000 businesses and investors-- including sectors that might be surprising to some of you-- all came together to voice their support for carbon pricing. The long list of supporters includes energy companies like BP, Royal Dutch Shell, utilities like PG&E, transportation companies like British Airways, construction firms like Cemex, financial institutions like Deutsche Bank, like Swiss Re, and consumer goods corporations like Unilever and Nokia. These companies all believe that carbon pricing will establish the necessary certainty in the marketplace that helps the private sector to move the capital that helps to solve the problem. Carbon pricing allows citizens, innovators, and companies-- it allows the market to make independent decisions free from the government to be able to best drive their emission reductions. And this is also, by the way, the chief reason that carbon pricing has received support from leaders and economists on both sides of the aisle in the United States of America. A price on carbon, coupled with government support for innovation in key sectors, is easily one of the most compelling tools for the world to accelerate the clean energy transformation that we are working to achieve. Now, while it may be some time before we see this ideal outcome, the effort to improve carbon markets ought to be a priority going forward. The bottom line is that there are many tools at the world's disposal. The COP itself is an important tool, in a sense. It has become much more of a--much more than just a gathering of government officials. It's really a yearly summit, 25,000 people strong this year from all over the world, for all sectors to showcase their commitment to climate action and to discuss ways to expand shared efforts. It's a regular reminder of exactly how much this movement has grown--and how many people, in how many countries, are committed to action. Walking around the conference here before I was coming in here and seeing this site in Marrakech, and seeing the delegations and the business leaders, the entrepreneurs and the activists who have traveled from near and far to be here, it's abundantly clear we have the ability to prevent the worst impacts of climate change. But again, we're forced to ask: Do we have the collective will? Because our success is not going to happen by accident. It won't happen without sustained commitment, without cooperation and creative thinking. And it won't happen without confident investors and innovative entrepreneurs. And it certainly won't happen without leadership. For those in power in all parts of the world, including my own, who may be confronted with decisions about which road to take at this critical juncture, I ask you, on behalf of billions of people around the world: Don't take my word for it. Don't take just the existence of this COP as the stamp of approval for it. I ask you to see for yourselves. Do your own due diligence before making irrevocable choices. Examine closely what it is that has persuaded the Pope, presidents, and prime ministers all over the world, leaders around the world, to take on the responsibility of responding to this threat. Talk to the business leaders of Fortune 500 companies and smaller innovative companies, all of whom are eager to invest in the energy markets of the future. Get the best economists' judgment on the risk of inaction, of what the cost would be to global economies, versus the opportunities that are to be found in the clean energy market of the future. Speak with the military leaders who view climate change as a global security concern, as a threat multiplier. Ask farmers about--and fisherman about the impact of dramatic changes in weather patterns on their current ability to make a living and to support their families or on what they see for the future. Listen to faith leaders talk about the moral responsibility that human beings have to act as stewards of the planet that we have to share, the only planet we have. Bring in the activists and civil society, groups who have worked for years with communities all over the world to raise awareness and to respond to this threat. Ask young people about their legitimate concerns for the planet that their children will inherit in reducing emissions worldwide. And above all, consult with the scientists who have dedicated their entire lives to expanding our understanding of this challenge, and whose work will be in vain unless we sound the alarm loud enough for everyone to hear. No one has a right to make decisions that affect billions of people based on solely ideology or without proper input. Anyone who has these conversations, who takes the time to learn from these experts, who gets the full picture of what we're facing--I believe they can only come to one legitimate decision, and that is to act boldly on climate change and encourage others to do the same. Now, I want to acknowledge that since this COP started, obviously, an election took place in my country. And I know it has left some here and elsewhere feeling uncertain about the future. I obviously understand that uncertainty. And while I can't stand here and speculate about what policies our president-elect will pursue, I will tell you this: In the time that I have spent in public life, one of the things I have learned is that some issues look a little bit different when you're actually in office compared to when you're on the campaign trail. And the truth is that climate change shouldn't be a partisan issue in the first place. It isn't a partisan issue for our military leaders at the Pentagon who call climate change a threat multiplier. (Applause.) It isn't a partisan issue for those military leaders because of the way that climate change exacerbates conflicts all over the world and who view it as a threat to military [[Page S6706]] readiness at their bases and could suffer the consequences of rising seas and stronger storms. It isn't a partisan issue for our intelligence community, who just this year released a report detailing the implications of climate change for U.S. national security: threats to the stability of fragile nations, heightened social and political tensions, rising food prices, increased risks to human health, and more. It isn't a partisan issue for mayors from New Orleans to Miami, who are already working hard to manage sunny-day floods and stronger storm surges caused by climate change. It isn't partisan for liberal and conservative business leaders alike who are investing unprecedented amounts of money into renewables, voluntarily committing to reduce their own emissions, and even holding their supply chains accountable to their overall carbon footprint. And there's nothing partisan about climate change for the world scientists who are near unanimous in their conclusion that climate change is real, it is happening, human beings for the most part are causing it, and we will have increasing catastrophic impacts on our way of life if we don't take the dramatic steps necessary to reduce the carbon footprint of our civilization. Now, whether we are able to meet this moment is a big test--probably as big a test of courage and vision as you'll ever find. Every nation has a responsibility to do its part if we are going to pass that test--and only those nations who step up and respond to this threat can legitimately lay claim to a mantle of global leadership. That's a fact. More than his love of Marrakech, Winston Churchill was known for his hard-nosed insight and the way that he expressed it. He once argued, tellingly: ``It's not always enough that we do our best; sometimes we have to do what is required.'' We know today what is required. And with all of the real- world evidence, with all of the peer-reviewed science, with all of the plain just old common sense, there isn't anyone who can credibly argue otherwise. So we have to continue this fight, my friends. We have to continue to defy expectations. We have to continue to accelerate the global transition to a clean energy economy. And we have to continue to hold one another accountable for the choices that our nations makes. Earlier this year, on Earth Day, I had the great privilege of signing the Paris Agreement on behalf of President Obama and the United States. It was a special day. And because my daughter lives in New York, I invited her to join me at the UN. She surprised me by bringing my 2-year-old granddaughter, Isabelle, along as well. And that morning, I had been thinking about the history that had brought us to that day. I thought about the first Earth Day in 1970 that I mentioned earlier, when I joined with millions of Americans in teach-ins to educate the public about the environmental challenges we faced. I thought about the first UN climate conference in Rio, which is actually where I met my wife Teresa, and I thought of the urgency that we all felt way back then in 1992. And of course, I thought about that December night at Le Bourget, when it seemed--for the first time--that the world had finally found the path forward. But as I sat and I played with my granddaughter, waiting for my turn to go out and sign the Agreement, I thought, not of the past, but I thought of the future. Her future. The world her children would one day inherit. And when it was time for me to go up on that stage, I scooped her up and I brought her out with me. I wanted to share that moment with her. And I'll never forget it. But to my surprise, people responded to her presence that day, and since then so many people have said to me, they've conveyed to me how that moment conveyed something special and moved them. They told me they thought of their own children, their own grandchildren. They thought of the future. They were reminded of the stakes. Ladies and gentlemen, here in Marrakech, in the next hours, let us make clear to the world that we will always remember the stakes. Let us stand firm in support of the goals that we set in Paris and recommit ourselves to double our efforts to meet them. Let us say that when it comes to climate change, we will commit not just to doing our best, but as Winston Churchill admonished, we will do what is required. I look forward to working with you in this important work for whatever number of years ahead I have a chance to. Thank you. ____________________",package_114_212.csv,39544,39544,39614,"[congressional record volume 162, number 174 (monday, december 5, 2016)] [senate] [pages s6702-s6706] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] secretary kerry's remarks at cop22 mr. markey. mr. president, last year the world came together in paris to support a truly historic agreement on climate change. and 2015 was also historic for another reason: it was the hottest year in an observational record that stretches back to the 1880s. in fact, 15 of the 16 hottest years on the planet have occurred since 2000. recently, july and august 2016 tied the global record for the hottest month, and 2016 is on track to be the warmest year yet. the evidence on climate change is overwhelming. scientists have understood the fundamental physics for over a century. and the world agrees that we must take action to curb dangerous carbon pollution and reduce the effects of climate change. a majority of the united states agrees that we must take action. the swiftness with which the paris climate accord came into force demonstrates the global commitment to addressing the serious concerns of climate change. it is also a testament to the leadership of president barack obama and secretary of state john kerry. this year, the world again came together at the united nations climate change conference in marrakesh, morocco, to begin forging the path towards a lower-emissions world and clean energy future. and while there is much work to be done, we are heading in the right direction. we have seen the price of solar energy reach record lows and the rate of new solar installation reach record highs. we have seen states, regions, and countries reduce their carbon pollution while growing their economies. these positive steps will not only curb carbon pollution, but also create good, well-paying clean energy jobs. climate change is a challenge for the entire world. through the paris climate accord, the international community has decided to face this challenge head on, and the united states must continue to be the global leader. [[page s6703]] under the leadership of sectary of state john kerry, the united states has carried this mantle. in the speech that secretary kerry delivered last month in marrakesh, morocco, at the 22nd meeting of the conference of parties to the united nationals framework convention on climate change and first session of the conference of parties to the paris agreement, secretary kerry shared his vision for our future: a brighter, cleaner, healthier and more prosperous one. he said: thank you so much, everybody. i apologize for being a few moments late. there was a fire and then there was some traffic backed up, and so here i am and here are you, and thank you for being here. let me begin by thanking our terrific u.s. special envoy for climate change jonathan pershing. i couldn't be luckier than to have him in this job. he was over at the energy department for a while. we stole him from ernie moniz, who is a great colleague and was gracious in my theft. and he has done a spectacular job working with all of our international partners as we begin the hard work of implementing the paris agreement. and i also want to thank ambassador jennifer haverkamp, who, along with jonathan and a lot of the team that i see sitting here, has done an absolutely terrific job in leading the state department's efforts to advance our climate goals this year. and i have to tell you--well, let me just divert for a minute. i also want to thank brian deese--i don't know if he's here--but i'm grateful for president obama's senior advisor on climate issues and the entire intrepid u.s. delegation to the cop, whom i had a chance to meet with earlier this morning, but we've kind of traveled this road together. i also thank our international partners, and particularly the executive secretary of the unfccc, patricia espinosa; the outgoing president of the cop, minister segolene royal of france; and the incoming cop president, my friend and our host this week, minister salaheddine mezouar, the foreign minister of morocco. and i also want to thank our partners from fiji, who will serve as president for the next cop, which i intend hopefully to attend as citizen kerry. it's a great pleasure for me to be able to be here in marrakech. i'm reminded of one of the 20th century's most outsized figures whose connection with this city is so famous--sir winston churchill. he loved to paint the landscapes here and to absorb the beauty and the culture. and in fact, at the very height of world war ii, as he and president franklin roosevelt and allied leaders gathered in casablanca to plan the strategy for the european theater, churchill was absolutely stunned to learn that roosevelt had never been to this part of morocco. so in a move that perhaps only winston churchill would get away with in the middle of a global war--world war--churchill convinced roosevelt to extend his visit and drive through what was still, at the time, a country engulfed in active combat. so after several hours on the loose, and because we're talking about winston churchill, plenty of scotch-- (laughter)--the two leaders arrived in marrakech in time to see the sun set on the atlas mountains. and churchill said it was the loveliest view on earth. so i think it's fitting, therefore, that almost three- quarters of a century later, friends and allies meet again in marrakech in order to undertake a very important discussion-- a discussion about the natural world that surrounds us and the importance of preserving it for generations to come. as jonathan mentioned, climate change is deeply personal to me, but it's personal to everyone in this room. i know that. and we obviously want it to be just as personal for everyone in every room: men, women, children, businesspeople, consumers, parents, teachers, students, grandparents. wherever we live, whatever our calling, whatever our background must be, this is an imperative. now, i know the danger of preaching to the choir--and, obviously, all of us here are the proverbial choir. but i'm actually grateful for that, because here at the 22nd cop, no one can deny the remarkable progress that we have made-- progress that actually was pretty hard to imagine even a few years ago. the global community is more united than ever not just in accepting the challenge, but in confronting it with real action, in making a difference. and no one should doubt the overwhelming majority of the citizens of the united states who know climate change is happening and who are determined to keep our commitments that were made in paris. (applause.) none of us will forget the moment last december at le bourget, when the former foreign minister of france, with segolene and a bunch of you there, led by our friend laurent fabius, who gaveled in the strongest, most ambitious global climate agreement ever negotiated. it was an accord that took literally decades to achieve--the proud work product of principled diplomacy, and ultimately, a deeply held, shared understanding that we're all in this together. and when we left paris, no one rested on their laurels. instead, the world--unified--moved expeditiously to begin the--to pull the agreement permanently into force, crossing the thresholds of 55 countries representing 55 percent of global emissions, and doing so far faster than even the most optimistic among us might have predicted. in a powerful statement of the whole world's broad commitment to this agreement, in less than a year, 109 countries representing nearly 75 percent of the world's emissions have now formally committed to bold, decisive action--and we are determined to affirm that action and to stick with it out of marrakech. now, we have in place--(applause)--so we have in place a foundation, based on national climate goals--109 nations, each of them have come up with their own plan, each of us setting goals that are based on our own abilities and our own circumstances. this agreement is, in fact, the essence of common but differentiated responsibilities. it provides support to countries that need help meeting the targets. it leaves no country to weather the storm of climate change alone. it marshals an array of tools in order to help developing nations to invest in infrastructure, technology, and the science to get the job done. it supports the most vulnerable countries, so they can better adapt to the climate impacts that many of those countries are already confronting. and finally, it enables us to ratchet up ambition over time as technology develops and as the price of clean energy comes down. this is critical: the agreement calls on the parties to revisit their national pledges every five years, in order to ensure that we keep pace with the technology and that we accelerate the global transition to a clean energy economy. this process--a cornerstone of our agreement--gives us a framework that is built to last, and a degree of global accountability that has never before existed. but i want to share with you that the progress that we've made this year goes well beyond paris. in early october, the international civil aviation organization established a sector-wide agreement for carbon- neutral growth. why is this so important? because international aviation wasn't covered by what we did in paris, and if that aviation was a country, it would rank among the top dozen greenhouse gas emitters in the world. a few weeks later, i was pleased to be in kigali, rwanda, when representatives from again nearly 200 countries came together to phase down the global use and production of hydrofluorocarbons--which has been expected to increase very rapidly with a danger that is multiple of times more damaging than carbon dioxide. the kigali agreement could singlehandedly help us to avoid an entire half a degree centigrade of warming by the end of the century--while at the same time opening up new opportunities for growth in a range of industries. all of these steps combine to move the needle in the direction that we need to. and in large part because global leaders have woken up to the enormity of this challenge, the world is now beginning to move forward together towards a clean energy future. over the past decade, the global renewable energy market has expanded more than six-fold. last year, investment in renewable energy was at an all-time high--nearly $350 billion. but that only tells you part of the story. an average of--that 350 billion is the first time that we've been able to see that money outpacing what is being put into fossil fuels. an average of half a million new solar panels were installed every single day last year. and for the first time since the pre-industrial era, despite the fact that you have global prices of oil and gas and coal that are lower than ever, still more of the world's money was invested in renewable energy technologies than in new fossil fuel plants. and like many of you, i've seen this transformation take hold in my own country. that's why i'm confident about the future, regardless of what policy might be chosen, because of the marketplace. i've met with leaders and innovators in the energy industry all across our nation, and i am excited about the path that they are on. america's wind generation has tripled since 2008 and that will continue, and solar generation has increased 30 times over. and the reason both of those will continue is that the marketplace will dictate that, not the government. i can tell you with confidence that the united states is right now, today, on our way to meeting all of the international targets that we've set, and because of the market decisions that are being made, i do not believe that that can or will be reversed. (applause.) now, much of this is due to president obama's leadership, and our congress also moving in a bipartisan fashion on things like tax credits for renewable energy. this leadership has helped to inspire targeted investment from the private sector. today our emissions are being driven down because market-based forces are taking hold all over the world. and that's what we said we would do in paris. none of us pretended that in paris, the agreement itself was going to achieve two degrees. what we knew is we were sending that critical message to the marketplace, and businesses have responded, as i just described. most businesspeople have come to understand: investing in clean energy simply makes good economic sense. you can make money. you can do good and do well at the same time. now, significantly, the renewable energy boom isn't limited to industrialized countries, and that's important to note. in fact, emerging economies like china, india, and brazil invested even more in renewable technologies last year than the developed world. china alone invested more than 100 billion dollars. ultimately, clean energy is expected [[page s6704]] to be a multitrillion dollar market--the largest market the world has ever known. and no nation will do well if it sits on the sidelines, handicapping its new businesses from reaping the benefits of the clean-tech explosion. my friends, we are in the midst of a global renewable energy surge, and as a result, in many places, clean energy has already reached cost parity with fossil fuels. millions around the world are currently employed by the renewable energy industry. and if we make the right choices, millions more people will be put to work. so good things are happening. the energy curve is bending towards sustainability. the market is clearly headed towards clean energy, and that trend will only become more pronounced. now, for those of us who have been working on this challenge for decades, this really is a turning point. it is a cause for optimism, notwithstanding what you see in different countries with respect to politics and change. in no uncertain terms, the question now is not whether we will transition to energy economy--to a clean energy economy. that we've already begun to do. the question now is whether or not we are going to have the will to get this job done. that's the question now--whether we will make the transition in time to be able to do what we have to do to prevent catastrophic damage. ladies and gentlemen, i'm not a cassandra. you can tell from what i've said. but i'm a realist. time is not on our side. the world is already changing at an increasingly alarming rate with increasingly alarming consequences. the last time that morocco hosted the cop was in 2001, and the intervening 15 years have been among the 16 hottest years in recorded history. 2016 is going to be the warmest year of all. every month so far has broken a record. and this year will contribute its record-breaking heat to the hottest decade in recorded history, which was, by the way, preceded by the second-hottest decade, which was preceded by the third hottest decade. at some point, even the strongest skeptic has to acknowledge that something disturbing is happening. we have seen record-breaking droughts everywhere--from india to brazil to the west coast of the united states. storms that used to happen once every 500 years are becoming relatively normal. in recent years, an average of 22.5 million people have been displaced by extreme weather events annually. we never saw that in the 20th century. communities in island states like fiji have already been forced to take steps to relocate permanently, because the places they have called home for generations are now uninhabitable. and there are many, many more who know it's only a matter of time before rising oceans begin to inundate their cities. i know this is a lot for anyone to process--hard to process. that's why i have found that whenever possible, the best way to try to understand and to see whether people are pushing the envelope of thinking on this or not is to see for oneself what is happening. that's why this summer i went to greenland to visit the incredible jakobshavn glacier. scientists pointed out to me the lines many meters above the water today that mark the glacier's retreat which it has done more in the past 15 years than it did in the entire previous century. and while i was there, i boarded a danish naval vessel and i traveled through the ice fjord. i saw the massive ice chunks that had just broken off from the glacier to melt inexorably into the sea. and because they come off greenland, which is on rock, every bit of that ice contributes to the rise of the ocean. since the 1990s, the painful pace of that melting has nearly tripled. every day, 86 million metric tons of ice makes its way down that fjord into the ocean. and the total flow that comes off that glacier in a single year is enough water to meet the needs of new york city for two decades. but experts in greenland and elsewhere have always warned me, and they warned me on this trip this summer, if you really want to understand what's happening and what the threat is, go to antarctica. nowhere on the planet are the stakes as high as they are on the opposite end of the globe. for half a century, climate scientists have believed the west antarctic ice sheet is a sword of damocles hanging over our entire way of life. should it break apart and melt into the sea, it alone could raise global sea levels by four to five meters. and the scientists down there described to me how the pressure of the ice and the weight of the ice pushes the entire continent down so that it's grounded on the base of earth's crust and rock. but that allows warmer sea water to creep in under the glacier and speed up the process of the melting and destabilize the glacier. antarctica contains ice sheets that are, in some places, on the east antarctic ice sheet three miles deep. and if all that ice were somehow able to melt away completely because we are irresponsible about climate change, in the coming centuries, sea level would rise somewhere over 100 to 200 feet. that's why i flew last week to mcmurdo station in antarctica to meet with our scientists and to understand better what is taking place. i flew by helicopter over the west antarctic ice sheet. i walked out onto the ross sea ice shelf. and i talked with the scientists who are on the front lines, not people involved in day to day politics, but people who are making scientific judgment and doing extensive research. and they were crystal clear: the more they learn, the more alarmed they become about the speed with which these changes are happening. a scientist from new zealand named gavin dunbar described what they're seeing there as the quote, ``canary in the coal mine'' and warned that some thresholds, if we cross them, cannot be reversed. in other words, we can't wait too long to translate the science that we have today into the policies that are necessary to address this challenge. these scientists urged me to remind my own government and governments around the world and everyone here that what we do right now--today-- matters, because if we don't go far enough and if we don't go fast enough, the damage we inflict could take centuries to undo--if it can be undone at all. i underscore today: we don't get a second chance. the consequences of failure would in most cases be irreversible. and if we lose this moment for action, there's no speech decades from now that will put these massive ice sheets back together. there's no magic wand in any capital in the world that you can wave to refill all of the lakes and rivers that will dry up, or make farm--arid farm land fertile again. and we certainly won't have the power to hold back rising tides as they encroach on our shores. so we have to get this right, and we have to get it right now. the scientists in antarctica told me that they are still trying to figure out how quickly this is all happening. but they know for certain that it's happening, and it's happening faster than we previously thought possible. the alarm bells ought to be going off everywhere. as an american glacial geologist told me down there, a fellow by the name of john stone, he said, ``the catastrophic period could already be underway.'' that's why wise public policy demands that we take precautionary measures now. still, despite the real-life changes that are being done and the threat of more to come, it's important to remind ourselves that we are not on a pre-ordained path to disaster. this is not pre-ordained. it's not written in the stars. this is about choices--choices that we still have. this is a test of willpower, not capacity. it's within our power to put the planet back on a better track. but doing that requires holding ourselves accountable to the hard truth. it requires holding ourselves accountable to facts, not opinion; to science, not theories that haven't been proven and can't be proven; and certainly not to political bromides and slogans. for all the progress that we are making, at the current pace we will not meet our goal. i said that earlier. we knew in paris that what we were doing was trying to start down a road. but we also knew it doesn't get us to the end of the journey. yes, renewables make up more than half of all the new electricity installation last year. that's progress. but the reality is because of the existing energy infrastructure already in place, that new energy only generated a little more than 10 percent of the world's total energy. that is nowhere near what we need in order to achieve our goals. if we're going to have the ability to stave off the worst impacts of climate change, we have to dramatically accelerate the transition that is already starting. we need to get to a point where clean sources are generating most of the world's energy, and we need to get there fast. certainly experts tell us by the middle of this century we have to get there. now, i've said many times, and i'll say it again today: it is not going to be governments alone, or even principally, that solve the climate challenge. the private sector is the most important player. and already we are seeing real solutions coming from entrepreneurs and academia. it's going to be innovators, workers, and business leaders, many of whom have been hammering away at this challenge for years who are going to continue to create the technological advances that forever revolutionize the way that we power our world. but make no mistake, government leadership is absolutely essential. and because today is the last opportunity i will have to address the cop as secretary of state, i just want to take a moment to underscore the work that government leaders can do and should do, especially the 200--almost 200 nations represented here. now, we know that we have not come to marrakech to bask in the glow of paris. we've come here to move forward. in doing so, we cannot forget that the contributions we've each made thus far were never meant to be the ceiling. they're a foundation on which we expect to build. and unless our nations voluntarily ratchet up our ambition, and unless we continue to put sustained pressure on one another to act wisely, we will have difficulty meeting the current mitigation needs, let alone holding temperature increases at 2 degrees warming, which science tells us is a tipping point. and if we fall short, it will be the single greatest instance in modern history of a generation in a time of crisis abdicating responsibility for the future. and it won't just be a policy failure; because of the nature of this challenge, it will be a moral failure, a betrayal of devastating consequence. now, i know not--that's not what any of us here signed up for. as pope francis said, ``we receive this world as an inheritance from past generations, but also as a loan for future generations, to whom we will have to return it.'' now, i fully recognize the challenges that a number of countries face because they have a big population, they have a growing economy, they have a lot of people in poverty, [[page s6705]] they're determined to maintain stability and pull those people into the economy. and of course, they're concerned about stability--we all are. access to affordable energy is a key part of providing that stability. and the dirtiest sources of energy are, unfortunately, some of the cheapest. but i emphasize this: only in the short term. in the long term, it's an entirely different story, folks. in the long term, carbon-intensive energy is actually today, right now, one of the costliest and most foolhardy investments any nation can possibly make. and that is because the final invoice for carbon-based energy includes a lot more than just the price of the oil or the coal, or the natural gas; it--or the price of building the power plant. the real cost accounting needs to fully consider all of the downstream consequences, which, in the case of dirty fuels, are enough to at least double or triple the initial expenses. that's the kind of accounting that we need to do today. just think about the price of environmental and agricultural degradation. think about the loss of an ability of farmers in one area because of the lack of water or too much heat to be able to grow their crops today. think of the hospital bills for asthma and emphysema patients, and the millions of deaths that are linked to air pollution caused by the use of fossil fuels. in 2014, a study found that up to six million people in china have black lung because they lived and worked so close to coal-fired power plants. there are nearly 20 million new asthma cases a year in india linked to coal-related air pollution, and in the united states, asthma costs taxpayers more than $55 billion annually. the greatest cause of children being hospitalized in the summer in the united states is environmentally induced asthma. these are real costs, and they need to be added to the tally. we also have to include the price tag of rebuilding after devastating storms and flooding. just in the first three quarters of this year alone, extreme weather events have cost the united states--have cost american taxpayers $27 billion in damage. in august alone, louisiana experienced flooding that resulted in roughly $10 billion worth of damage. so none of us can afford to be oblivious to these expenses, and these initial costs are in reality just a glimpse of what the future could hold in store for us if we fail to respond. just imagine: sea barriers that have to be built. go down to miami--in south miami, they're building--they're raising streets to deal with flooding that's already occurring, building new storm drains and assessing people additional tax in order to do it. massive increases in cost of maintaining infrastructure to control flooding, withstand storms. power outages. all of this and more has to be added to any honest assessment of high-carbon energy sources. and in an age of increasing transparency and public demand for accountability, citizens in the long run will not accept phony accounting or an obfuscation of the consequences of the decisions. so everyone needs to make smarter choices--with the long game, not the short game, in mind. coal, unfortunately, is the single biggest contributor to global carbon pollution. it provides about 30 percent of the world's energy, but it produces nearly 50 percent of the world's greenhouse gases. the unprecedented investments that we are now seeing in clean energy will mean very, very little if, at the same time, new coal fire plants without carbon capture are coming online and at a rate dumping into the atmosphere more and more of the very pollution that we're all working so hard to reduce. some of these projections, i have to tell you, are deeply troubling. for example, between now and 2040, the demand for electricity in southeast asia is likely to triple--and the bulk of that demand is currently expected to be met by growth--where? in the coal-fired power sector, rather than clean energy. that threatens everything we're trying to achieve here. we literally cannot use one hand to pat ourselves on the back for what we've done to take steps to address climate change, and then turn around and use the other hand to write a big fat check enabling the widespread development of the dirtiest source of fuel in an outdated way. it just doesn't make sense. that's suicide. and that's how we all lose this fight. make no mistake: people all over the world are working for victory in this. and this issue is increasingly capturing the attention of citizens everywhere, and certainly the private sector. the private sector welcomed the signals that we sent in paris, but they are demanding even stronger signals now-- the private sector--so that they can invest clean energy solutions with even greater confidence. one of the strongest signals that government can send, one of the most powerful ways to reduce emissions at the lowest possible course--cost--is to move toward carbon pricing that puts basic, free-market economics to work in addressing this challenge. now obviously, this is not a new idea. many have come to this conclusion already. the share of global emissions that are covered by a carbon price has tripled over the last decade. last year, more than 1,000 businesses and investors-- including sectors that might be surprising to some of you-- all came together to voice their support for carbon pricing. the long list of supporters includes energy companies like bp, royal dutch shell, utilities like pg&e, transportation companies like british airways, construction firms like cemex, financial institutions like deutsche bank, like swiss re, and consumer goods corporations like unilever and nokia. these companies all believe that carbon pricing will establish the necessary certainty in the marketplace that helps the private sector to move the capital that helps to solve the problem. carbon pricing allows citizens, innovators, and companies-- it allows the market to make independent decisions free from the government to be able to best drive their emission reductions. and this is also, by the way, the chief reason that carbon pricing has received support from leaders and economists on both sides of the aisle in the united states of america. a price on carbon, coupled with government support for innovation in key sectors, is easily one of the most compelling tools for the world to accelerate the clean energy transformation that we are working to achieve. now, while it may be some time before we see this ideal outcome, the effort to improve carbon markets ought to be a priority going forward. the bottom line is that there are many tools at the world's disposal. the cop itself is an important tool, in a sense. it has become much more of a--much more than just a gathering of government officials. it's really a yearly summit, 25,000 people strong this year from all over the world, for all sectors to showcase their commitment to climate action and to discuss ways to expand shared efforts. it's a regular reminder of exactly how much this movement has grown--and how many people, in how many countries, are committed to action. walking around the conference here before i was coming in here and seeing this site in marrakech, and seeing the delegations and the business leaders, the entrepreneurs and the activists who have traveled from near and far to be here, it's abundantly clear we have the ability to prevent the worst impacts of climate change. but again, we're forced to ask: do we have the collective will? because our success is not going to happen by accident. it won't happen without sustained commitment, without cooperation and creative thinking. and it won't happen without confident investors and innovative entrepreneurs. and it certainly won't happen without leadership. for those in power in all parts of the world, including my own, who may be confronted with decisions about which road to take at this critical juncture, i ask you, on behalf of billions of people around the world: don't take my word for it. don't take just the existence of this cop as the stamp of approval for it. i ask you to see for yourselves. do your own due diligence before making irrevocable choices. examine closely what it is that has persuaded the pope, presidents, and prime ministers all over the world, leaders around the world, to take on the responsibility of responding to this threat. talk to the business leaders of fortune 500 companies and smaller innovative companies, all of whom are eager to invest in the energy markets of the future. get the best economists' judgment on the risk of inaction, of what the cost would be to global economies, versus the opportunities that are to be found in the clean energy market of the future. speak with the military leaders who view climate change as a global security concern, as a threat multiplier. ask farmers about--and fisherman about the impact of dramatic changes in weather patterns on their current ability to make a living and to support their families or on what they see for the future. listen to faith leaders talk about the moral responsibility that human beings have to act as stewards of the planet that we have to share, the only planet we have. bring in the activists and civil society, groups who have worked for years with communities all over the world to raise awareness and to respond to this threat. ask young people about their legitimate concerns for the planet that their children will inherit in reducing emissions worldwide. and above all, consult with the scientists who have dedicated their entire lives to expanding our understanding of this challenge, and whose work will be in vain unless we sound the alarm loud enough for everyone to hear. no one has a right to make decisions that affect billions of people based on solely ideology or without proper input. anyone who has these conversations, who takes the time to learn from these experts, who gets the full picture of what we're facing--i believe they can only come to one legitimate decision, and that is to act boldly on climate change and encourage others to do the same. now, i want to acknowledge that since this cop started, obviously, an election took place in my country. and i know it has left some here and elsewhere feeling uncertain about the future. i obviously understand that uncertainty. and while i can't stand here and speculate about what policies our president-elect will pursue, i will tell you this: in the time that i have spent in public life, one of the things i have learned is that some issues look a little bit different when you're actually in office compared to when you're on the campaign trail. and the truth is that climate change shouldn't be a partisan issue in the first place. it isn't a partisan issue for our military leaders at the pentagon who call climate change a threat multiplier. (applause.) it isn't a partisan issue for those military leaders because of the way that climate change exacerbates conflicts all over the world and who view it as a threat to military [[page s6706]] readiness at their bases and could suffer the consequences of rising seas and stronger storms. it isn't a partisan issue for our intelligence community, who just this year released a report detailing the implications of climate change for u.s. national security: threats to the stability of fragile nations, heightened social and political tensions, rising food prices, increased risks to human health, and more. it isn't a partisan issue for mayors from new orleans to miami, who are already working hard to manage sunny-day floods and stronger storm surges caused by climate change. it isn't partisan for liberal and conservative business leaders alike who are investing unprecedented amounts of money into renewables, voluntarily committing to reduce their own emissions, and even holding their supply chains accountable to their overall carbon footprint. and there's nothing partisan about climate change for the world scientists who are near unanimous in their conclusion that climate change is real, it is happening, human beings for the most part are causing it, and we will have increasing catastrophic impacts on our way of life if we don't take the dramatic steps necessary to reduce the carbon footprint of our civilization. now, whether we are able to meet this moment is a big test--probably as big a test of courage and vision as you'll ever find. every nation has a responsibility to do its part if we are going to pass that test--and only those nations who step up and respond to this threat can legitimately lay claim to a mantle of global leadership. that's a fact. more than his love of marrakech, winston churchill was known for his hard-nosed insight and the way that he expressed it. he once argued, tellingly: ``it's not always enough that we do our best; sometimes we have to do what is required.'' we know today what is required. and with all of the real- world evidence, with all of the peer-reviewed science, with all of the plain just old common sense, there isn't anyone who can credibly argue otherwise. so we have to continue this fight, my friends. we have to continue to defy expectations. we have to continue to accelerate the global transition to a clean energy economy. and we have to continue to hold one another accountable for the choices that our nations makes. earlier this year, on earth day, i had the great privilege of signing the paris agreement on behalf of president obama and the united states. it was a special day. and because my daughter lives in new york, i invited her to join me at the un. she surprised me by bringing my 2-year-old granddaughter, isabelle, along as well. and that morning, i had been thinking about the history that had brought us to that day. i thought about the first earth day in 1970 that i mentioned earlier, when i joined with millions of americans in teach-ins to educate the public about the environmental challenges we faced. i thought about the first un climate conference in rio, which is actually where i met my wife teresa, and i thought of the urgency that we all felt way back then in 1992. and of course, i thought about that december night at le bourget, when it seemed--for the first time--that the world had finally found the path forward. but as i sat and i played with my granddaughter, waiting for my turn to go out and sign the agreement, i thought, not of the past, but i thought of the future. her future. the world her children would one day inherit. and when it was time for me to go up on that stage, i scooped her up and i brought her out with me. i wanted to share that moment with her. and i'll never forget it. but to my surprise, people responded to her presence that day, and since then so many people have said to me, they've conveyed to me how that moment conveyed something special and moved them. they told me they thought of their own children, their own grandchildren. they thought of the future. they were reminded of the stakes. ladies and gentlemen, here in marrakech, in the next hours, let us make clear to the world that we will always remember the stakes. let us stand firm in support of the goals that we set in paris and recommit ourselves to double our efforts to meet them. let us say that when it comes to climate change, we will commit not just to doing our best, but as winston churchill admonished, we will do what is required. i look forward to working with you in this important work for whatever number of years ahead i have a chance to. thank you. ____________________",39544

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Archbishop Joseph William Tobin of Indianapolis on his recent elevation to cardinal by Pope Francis and for his extraordinary service to Indiana. As a leader in our State, Cardinal Tobin has demonstrated his lifelong, faith-filled commitment to serving others and giving a voice to the voiceless. Born in Detroit, MI, Cardinal Tobin is the eldest of Joseph W. Tobin and Marie Terese Kerwin's 13 children. From an early age, it was apparent to his family that he was intellectually and spiritually gifted and wanted to use those talents by becoming a priest. Cardinal Tobin's family instilled in him the importance of faith and family, and he pursued the priesthood with purpose and determination. He received a bachelor of arts in philosophy from Holy Redeemer College in Waterford, WI, and a masters in religious education, as well as a masters in divinity from Mount Saint Alphonsus Seminary in Esopus, NY. Cardinal Tobin professed first vows as a Redemptorist missionary on August 5, 1973, and he was ordained to the priesthood on June 1, 1978. Over the next 12 years, Cardinal Tobin served communities in the Midwest, including in his hometown of Detroit and in Chicago. He then was elected general consultor to the Superior General of the Redemptorists and moved to Rome, Italy. During his 21 years in Italy, he was recognized for his efforts to promote dialogue and resolve tensions between the Vatican and U.S. nuns. He was elected and reelected as superior general and later named archbishop by Pope Benedict XVI, as well as secretary of the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life on August 2, 2010. Soon thereafter, he was ordained to the episcopacy on October 9, 2010, and approximately 2 years later, he was named Metropolitan Archbishop of Indianapolis. For 4 years, the Indianapolis archdiocese benefited greatly from Cardinal Tobin's leadership. His commitment to serving those in the greatest need and his tireless dedication to sharing the teachings of the Catholic Church with the people of central and southern Indiana have benefited countless Hoosiers. Pope Francis announced Archbishop Tobin's selection as cardinal on October 9, 2016, from the steps of St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican. Less than a month later, the Pope selected him to lead the archdiocese of Newark, NJ, which serves 1.5 million Catholics and is among the 10 largest dioceses in the country. Outside of the church, Cardinal Tobin has dedicated himself to various organizations including the Canon Law Society of America and the North American Orthodox-Catholic Theological Consultation. He also is a member of United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, USCCB, subcommittee on the Church in Africa and a consultant to the committee on ecumenical and interreligious affairs. On behalf of Hoosiers, I congratulate Cardinal Tobin and thank him for blessing us with his leadership. Let us honor Cardinal Tobin for his selfless commitment to serving his fellow citizens of the world and steadfast efforts to make Indiana and the world a better place. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S6706] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO CARDINAL JOSEPH WILLIAM TOBIN Mr. DONNELLY.

Wade is a native of Iowa, and I am proud to say that I nominated him for the U.S. Naval Academy in 1990. In May 1994, he earned a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering and reported to the Marine Corps' The Basic School. From there he completed flight training and was designated a naval aviator in March 1997. He deployed aboard the USS Enterprise in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. Wade later served as the commanding officer for the VMFA-122 ``Crusaders'' and forward deployed the squadron for 6 months into the Pacific Theater in support of theater security cooperation activities with Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines. After graduating from the National War College, he served as a military adviser in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy. Most recently, Wade has served in the Office of Legislative Affairs as a congressional affairs officer. His personal decorations include the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, Meritorious Service Medal with Gold Star, the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, and the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal with Gold Star. As he prepares to retire from the Marine Corps, I would like to take this opportunity to thank him for his service to our country and to wish him well in his future endeavors.

Wade is a native of Iowa, and I am proud to say that I nominated him for the U.S. Naval Academy in 1990. In May 1994, he earned a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering and reported to the Marine Corps' The Basic School. From there he completed flight training and was designated a naval aviator in March 1997. He deployed aboard the USS Enterprise in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. Wade later served as the commanding officer for the VMFA-122 ``Crusaders'' and forward deployed the squadron for 6 months into the Pacific Theater in support of theater security cooperation activities with Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines. After graduating from the National War College, he served as a military adviser in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy. Most recently, Wade has served in the Office of Legislative Affairs as a congressional affairs officer. His personal decorations include the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, Meritorious Service Medal with Gold Star, the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, and the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal with Gold Star. As he prepares to retire from the Marine Corps, I would like to take this opportunity to thank him for his service to our country and to wish him well in his future endeavors.

Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to Jim Lyons. Jim was a tax counsel for Chairman Hatch on the Finance Committee. Before that, he served as a tax counsel for the committee when I was ranking member. Jim had a medical emergency during a basketball game for charity which, unfortunately for us all, he did not survive. Those who knew Jim would not be surprised that he was spending an evening at an event to help others. He was well known for his generosity, whether it was donating holiday gifts for children in foster care or sharing his extensive knowledge of the Tax Code with younger staff who were learning the ropes. He was incredibly smart and had a zest for his work and for life that was joyous and inspiring to all of those around him. He loved to laugh and had a gift for making others laugh. Jim's quick wit is legendary, and he drew others to his company to hear what funny story or observation he might share next. Devising clever floor charts that made an insightful point about tax policy was a Jim Lyons specialty. He was extremely gifted in using humor to draw attention to a serious policy concern or to point out a political absurdity. It is a rare skill and one that Jim used to great effect. People liked to hear what he had to say. The tragedy of his loss in the prime of his life is immeasurable. Those of us who knew him take comfort in learning from his example. We can do serious work without taking ourselves too seriously. In fact, we might be much more successful by finding room to share a laugh with others. I wish Jim eternal peace and send my best wishes to his loving family. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S6707] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING JIM LYONS Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, South Kingstown Police Chief Vincent Vespia, Jr., has dedicated his career to protecting and serving the people of Rhode Island. He retired this month after nearly 60 years of exceptional service. The State's longest serving police chief began his career in 1959 as a trooper with the Rhode Island State police. Chief Vespia would eventually go on to become a State police organized crime investigator. His work helped bring down New England's top organized crime family. There are many stories about Vin Vespia. One of the most famous was when he crashed through a second floor window of a Federal Hill crap game from a bucket of a cherry picker, brandishing a machine gun at the surprised dice players. As Pulitzer Prize winning author Mike Stanton wrote in his book ``The Prince of Providence,'' ``Vespia was a kick-ass cop who had grown up on the Hill, playing in the street with some of the wise guys he now pursued.'' As a young trooper, Vespia had busted a former playmate with a truckload of stolen furs. ``How can you arrest me?'' the man asked. ``We played kick the can together.'' Replied Vespia: ``You went one way, I went another.'' After retiring from the State police, Vin was appointed chief of the South Kingstown Police Department in 1981. He would spend the next 35 years of his career building an effective, professional force with strong ties to the community. He created new leadership programs within the department's detective bureau and oversaw the construction of an innovative public safety facility with state-of-the-art information technology. Chief Vespia will be remembered for his leadership and fairness. Those he led describe him as dedicated, rational, and respectable. He has been called ``probably the most admired law enforcement officer in Rhode Island.'' I was honored to have worked with him when I was attorney general and am proud to call him my friend. Chief Vespia's 57 years of commitment and service to the people of Rhode Island represent the very best in law enforcement. I commend him and his family for the sacrifices they have made. On behalf of those he has served throughout the years, I offer my thanks. I wish Vin and Judith-Ann, his wife of 40 years, a happy retirement and the best of luck in all future endeavors. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S6707] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS ______ TRIBUTE TO VINCENT VESPIA, JR.

SHORT TITLE. This subtitle may be cited as the ``Creating and Restoring Equal Access to Equivalent Samples Act of 2016'' or the ``CREATES Act of 2016''. SEC. 3202. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) It is the policy of the United States to promote competition in the market for drugs and biological products by facilitating the timely entry of low-cost generic and biosimilar versions of those drugs and biological products. (2) Since their enactment in 1984 and 2010, respectively, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-417; 98 Stat. 1585) and the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (Subtitle A of title VII of Public Law 111-148; 124 Stat. 804), have provided pathways for making lower-cost versions of previously approved drugs and previously licensed biological products available to the people of the United States in a timely manner, thereby lowering overall prescription drug costs for patients and taxpayers by billions of dollars each year. (3) In order for these pathways to function as intended, developers of generic drugs and biosimilar biological products (referred to in this section as ``generic product developers'') must be able to obtain quantities of the reference listed drug or biological product with which the generic drug or biosimilar biological product is intended to compete (referred to in this section as a ``covered product'') for purposes of supporting an application for approval by the Food and Drug Administration, including for testing to show that-- (A) a prospective generic drug is bioequivalent to the covered product in accordance with subsection (j) of section 505 of the Federal, Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355), or meets the requirements for approval of an application submitted under subsection (b)(2) of that section; or (B) a prospective biosimilar biological product is biosimilar to or interchangeable with its reference biological product under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262(k)), as applicable. (4) For drugs and biological products that are subject to a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, another essential component in the creation of low-cost generic and biosimilar versions of covered products is the ability of generic product developers to join the manufacturer of the covered product (referred to in this section as the ``license holder'') in a single, shared system of elements to assure safe use and supporting agreements, or secure a variance therefrom, as required by section 505-1 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355-1). (5) Contrary to the policy of the United States to promote competition in the market for drugs and biological products by facilitating the timely entry of lower-cost generic and biosimilar versions of those drugs and biological products, certain license holders are preventing generic product developers from obtaining quantities of the covered product necessary for the generic product developer to support an application for approval by the Food and Drug Administration, including testing to show bioequivalence, biosimilarity, or interchangeability to the covered product, in some instances based on the justification that the covered product is subject to a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy with elements to assure safe use under section 505-1 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355-1). (6) The Director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research at the Food and Drug Administration has testified that some manufacturers of covered products have used REMS and distribution restrictions adopted by the manufacturer on their own behalf as reasons to not sell quantities of a covered product to generic product developers, causing barriers and delays in getting generic products on the market. The Food and Drug [[Page S6715]] Administration has reported receiving significant numbers of inquiries from generic product developers who were unable to obtain samples of covered products to conduct necessary testing and otherwise meet requirements for approval of generic drugs. (7) The Chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission has testified that the Federal Trade Commission continues to be very concerned about potential abuses by manufacturers of brand drugs of REMS or other closed distribution systems to impede generic competition. (8) Also contrary to the policy of the United States to promote competition in the market for drugs and biological products by facilitating the timely entry of lower-cost generic and biosimilar versions of those drugs and biological products, certain license holders are impeding the prompt negotiation and development on commercially reasonable terms of a single, shared system of elements to assure safe use, which may be necessary for the generic product developer to gain approval for its drug or licensing for its biological product. (9) While the antitrust laws may address the refusal by some license holders to provide quantities of a covered product to a generic product developer, a more tailored legal pathway would help ensure that generic product developers can obtain necessary quantities of a covered product in a timely way for purposes of developing a generic drug or biosimilar biological product, facilitating competition in the marketplace for drugs and biological products. (10) The antitrust laws may address actions by license holders who impede the prompt negotiation and development of a single, shared system of elements to assure safe use, and the Food and Drug Administration has some authority to waive the requirement of a single, shared system. Clearer regulatory authority to approve different systems that meet the statutory requirements to ensure patient safety, however, would limit the effectiveness of bad faith negotiations over single, shared systems to delay generic approval. At the same time, clearer regulatory authority would ensure all systems protect patient safety. SEC. 3203. ACTIONS FOR DELAYS OF GENERIC DRUGS AND BIOSIMILAR BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS.

SHORT TITLE. This subtitle may be cited as the ``Creating and Restoring Equal Access to Equivalent Samples Act of 2016'' or the ``CREATES Act of 2016''. SEC. 3202. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) It is the policy of the United States to promote competition in the market for drugs and biological products by facilitating the timely entry of low-cost generic and biosimilar versions of those drugs and biological products. (2) Since their enactment in 1984 and 2010, respectively, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-417; 98 Stat. 1585) and the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (Subtitle A of title VII of Public Law 111-148; 124 Stat. 804), have provided pathways for making lower-cost versions of previously approved drugs and previously licensed biological products available to the people of the United States in a timely manner, thereby lowering overall prescription drug costs for patients and taxpayers by billions of dollars each year. (3) In order for these pathways to function as intended, developers of generic drugs and biosimilar biological products (referred to in this section as ``generic product developers'') must be able to obtain quantities of the reference listed drug or biological product with which the generic drug or biosimilar biological product is intended to compete (referred to in this section as a ``covered product'') for purposes of supporting an application for approval by the Food and Drug Administration, including for testing to show that-- (A) a prospective generic drug is bioequivalent to the covered product in accordance with subsection (j) of section 505 of the Federal, Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355), or meets the requirements for approval of an application submitted under subsection (b)(2) of that section; or (B) a prospective biosimilar biological product is biosimilar to or interchangeable with its reference biological product under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262(k)), as applicable. (4) For drugs and biological products that are subject to a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, another essential component in the creation of low-cost generic and biosimilar versions of covered products is the ability of generic product developers to join the manufacturer of the covered product (referred to in this section as the ``license holder'') in a single, shared system of elements to assure safe use and supporting agreements, or secure a variance therefrom, as required by section 505-1 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355-1). (5) Contrary to the policy of the United States to promote competition in the market for drugs and biological products by facilitating the timely entry of lower-cost generic and biosimilar versions of those drugs and biological products, certain license holders are preventing generic product developers from obtaining quantities of the covered product necessary for the generic product developer to support an application for approval by the Food and Drug Administration, including testing to show bioequivalence, biosimilarity, or interchangeability to the covered product, in some instances based on the justification that the covered product is subject to a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy with elements to assure safe use under section 505-1 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355-1). (6) The Director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research at the Food and Drug Administration has testified that some manufacturers of covered products have used REMS and distribution restrictions adopted by the manufacturer on their own behalf as reasons to not sell quantities of a covered product to generic product developers, causing barriers and delays in getting generic products on the market. The Food and Drug [[Page S6715]] Administration has reported receiving significant numbers of inquiries from generic product developers who were unable to obtain samples of covered products to conduct necessary testing and otherwise meet requirements for approval of generic drugs. (7) The Chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission has testified that the Federal Trade Commission continues to be very concerned about potential abuses by manufacturers of brand drugs of REMS or other closed distribution systems to impede generic competition. (8) Also contrary to the policy of the United States to promote competition in the market for drugs and biological products by facilitating the timely entry of lower-cost generic and biosimilar versions of those drugs and biological products, certain license holders are impeding the prompt negotiation and development on commercially reasonable terms of a single, shared system of elements to assure safe use, which may be necessary for the generic product developer to gain approval for its drug or licensing for its biological product. (9) While the antitrust laws may address the refusal by some license holders to provide quantities of a covered product to a generic product developer, a more tailored legal pathway would help ensure that generic product developers can obtain necessary quantities of a covered product in a timely way for purposes of developing a generic drug or biosimilar biological product, facilitating competition in the marketplace for drugs and biological products. (10) The antitrust laws may address actions by license holders who impede the prompt negotiation and development of a single, shared system of elements to assure safe use, and the Food and Drug Administration has some authority to waive the requirement of a single, shared system. Clearer regulatory authority to approve different systems that meet the statutory requirements to ensure patient safety, however, would limit the effectiveness of bad faith negotiations over single, shared systems to delay generic approval. At the same time, clearer regulatory authority would ensure all systems protect patient safety. SEC. 3203. ACTIONS FOR DELAYS OF GENERIC DRUGS AND BIOSIMILAR BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS.

SHORT TITLE. This subtitle may be cited as the ``Creating and Restoring Equal Access to Equivalent Samples Act of 2016'' or the ``CREATES Act of 2016''. SEC. 3202. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) It is the policy of the United States to promote competition in the market for drugs and biological products by facilitating the timely entry of low-cost generic and biosimilar versions of those drugs and biological products. (2) Since their enactment in 1984 and 2010, respectively, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-417; 98 Stat. 1585) and the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (Subtitle A of title VII of Public Law 111-148; 124 Stat. 804), have provided pathways for making lower-cost versions of previously approved drugs and previously licensed biological products available to the people of the United States in a timely manner, thereby lowering overall prescription drug costs for patients and taxpayers by billions of dollars each year. (3) In order for these pathways to function as intended, developers of generic drugs and biosimilar biological products (referred to in this section as ``generic product developers'') must be able to obtain quantities of the reference listed drug or biological product with which the generic drug or biosimilar biological product is intended to compete (referred to in this section as a ``covered product'') for purposes of supporting an application for approval by the Food and Drug Administration, including for testing to show that-- (A) a prospective generic drug is bioequivalent to the covered product in accordance with subsection (j) of section 505 of the Federal, Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355), or meets the requirements for approval of an application submitted under subsection (b)(2) of that section; or (B) a prospective biosimilar biological product is biosimilar to or interchangeable with its reference biological product under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262(k)), as applicable. (4) For drugs and biological products that are subject to a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, another essential component in the creation of low-cost generic and biosimilar versions of covered products is the ability of generic product developers to join the manufacturer of the covered product (referred to in this section as the ``license holder'') in a single, shared system of elements to assure safe use and supporting agreements, or secure a variance therefrom, as required by section 505-1 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355-1). (5) Contrary to the policy of the United States to promote competition in the market for drugs and biological products by facilitating the timely entry of lower-cost generic and biosimilar versions of those drugs and biological products, certain license holders are preventing generic product developers from obtaining quantities of the covered product necessary for the generic product developer to support an application for approval by the Food and Drug Administration, including testing to show bioequivalence, biosimilarity, or interchangeability to the covered product, in some instances based on the justification that the covered product is subject to a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy with elements to assure safe use under section 505-1 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355-1). (6) The Director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research at the Food and Drug Administration has testified that some manufacturers of covered products have used REMS and distribution restrictions adopted by the manufacturer on their own behalf as reasons to not sell quantities of a covered product to generic product developers, causing barriers and delays in getting generic products on the market. The Food and Drug [[Page S6715]] Administration has reported receiving significant numbers of inquiries from generic product developers who were unable to obtain samples of covered products to conduct necessary testing and otherwise meet requirements for approval of generic drugs. (7) The Chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission has testified that the Federal Trade Commission continues to be very concerned about potential abuses by manufacturers of brand drugs of REMS or other closed distribution systems to impede generic competition. (8) Also contrary to the policy of the United States to promote competition in the market for drugs and biological products by facilitating the timely entry of lower-cost generic and biosimilar versions of those drugs and biological products, certain license holders are impeding the prompt negotiation and development on commercially reasonable terms of a single, shared system of elements to assure safe use, which may be necessary for the generic product developer to gain approval for its drug or licensing for its biological product. (9) While the antitrust laws may address the refusal by some license holders to provide quantities of a covered product to a generic product developer, a more tailored legal pathway would help ensure that generic product developers can obtain necessary quantities of a covered product in a timely way for purposes of developing a generic drug or biosimilar biological product, facilitating competition in the marketplace for drugs and biological products. (10) The antitrust laws may address actions by license holders who impede the prompt negotiation and development of a single, shared system of elements to assure safe use, and the Food and Drug Administration has some authority to waive the requirement of a single, shared system. Clearer regulatory authority to approve different systems that meet the statutory requirements to ensure patient safety, however, would limit the effectiveness of bad faith negotiations over single, shared systems to delay generic approval. At the same time, clearer regulatory authority would ensure all systems protect patient safety. SEC. 3203. ACTIONS FOR DELAYS OF GENERIC DRUGS AND BIOSIMILAR BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS.

(2) since their enactment in 1984 and 2010, respectively, the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 (public law 98-417; 98 stat. 1585) and the biologics price competition and innovation act of 2009 (subtitle a of title vii of public law 111-148; 124 stat. 804), have provided pathways for making lower-cost versions of previously approved drugs and previously licensed biological products available to the people of the united states in a timely manner, thereby lowering overall prescription drug costs for patients and taxpayers by billions of dollars each year. (3) in order for these pathways to function as intended, developers of generic drugs and biosimilar biological products (referred to in this section as ``generic product developers'') must be able to obtain quantities of the reference listed drug or biological product with which the generic drug or biosimilar biological product is intended to compete (referred to in this section as a ``covered product'') for purposes of supporting an application for approval by the food and drug administration, including for testing to show that-- (a) a prospective generic drug is bioequivalent to the covered product in accordance with subsection (j) of section 505 of the federal, food, drug, and cosmetic act (21 u.s.c. 355), or meets the requirements for approval of an application submitted under subsection (b)(2) of that section; or (b) a prospective biosimilar biological product is biosimilar to or interchangeable with its reference biological product under section 351(k) of the public health service act (42 u.s.c. 262(k)), as applicable. (4) for drugs and biological products that are subject to a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, another essential component in the creation of low-cost generic and biosimilar versions of covered products is the ability of generic product developers to join the manufacturer of the covered product (referred to in this section as the ``license holder'') in a single, shared system of elements to assure safe use and supporting agreements, or secure a variance therefrom, as required by section 505-1 of the federal food, drug, and cosmetic act (21 u.s.c. 355-1). (5) contrary to the policy of the united states to promote competition in the market for drugs and biological products by facilitating the timely entry of lower-cost generic and biosimilar versions of those drugs and biological products, certain license holders are preventing generic product developers from obtaining quantities of the covered product necessary for the generic product developer to support an application for approval by the food and drug administration, including testing to show bioequivalence, biosimilarity, or interchangeability to the covered product, in some instances based on the justification that the covered product is subject to a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy with elements to assure safe use under section 505-1 of the federal food, drug, and cosmetic act (21 u.s.c. 355-1). (6) the director of the center for drug evaluation and research at the food and drug administration has testified that some manufacturers of covered products have used rems and distribution restrictions adopted by the manufacturer on their own behalf as reasons to not sell quantities of a covered product to generic product developers, causing barriers and delays in getting generic products on the market. the food and drug [[page s6715]] administration has reported receiving significant numbers of inquiries from generic product developers who were unable to obtain samples of covered products to conduct necessary testing and otherwise meet requirements for approval of generic drugs. (7) the chairwoman of the federal trade commission has testified that the federal trade commission continues to be very concerned about potential abuses by manufacturers of brand drugs of rems or other closed distribution systems to impede generic competition. (8) also contrary to the policy of the united states to promote competition in the market for drugs and biological products by facilitating the timely entry of lower-cost generic and biosimilar versions of those drugs and biological products, certain license holders are impeding the prompt negotiation and development on commercially reasonable terms of a single, shared system of elements to assure safe use, which may be necessary for the generic product developer to gain approval for its drug or licensing for its biological product. (9) while the antitrust laws may address the refusal by some license holders to provide quantities of a covered product to a generic product developer, a more tailored legal pathway would help ensure that generic product developers can obtain necessary quantities of a covered product in a timely way for purposes of developing a generic drug or biosimilar biological product, facilitating competition in the marketplace for drugs and biological products. (10) the antitrust laws may address actions by license holders who impede the prompt negotiation and development of a single, shared system of elements to assure safe use, and the food and drug administration has some authority to waive the requirement of a single, shared system. clearer regulatory authority to approve different systems that meet the statutory requirements to ensure patient safety, however, would limit the effectiveness of bad faith negotiations over single, shared systems to delay generic approval. at the same time, clearer regulatory authority would ensure all systems protect patient safety. sec. 3203. actions for delays of generic drugs and biosimilar biological products.

Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Ms. Klobuchar, and Mr. Lee) submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to the bill H.R. 34, to authorize and strengthen the tsunami detection, forecast, warning, research, and mitigation program of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and for other purposes; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows: At the end of title III of division A, add the following: Subtitle K--CREATES Act SEC. 3201. SHORT TITLE. This subtitle may be cited as the ``Creating and Restoring Equal Access to Equivalent Samples Act of 2016'' or the ``CREATES Act of 2016''. SEC. 3202. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) It is the policy of the United States to promote competition in the market for drugs and biological products by facilitating the timely entry of low-cost generic and biosimilar versions of those drugs and biological products. (2) Since their enactment in 1984 and 2010, respectively, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-417; 98 Stat. 1585) and the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (Subtitle A of title VII of Public Law 111-148; 124 Stat. 804), have provided pathways for making lower-cost versions of previously approved drugs and previously licensed biological products available to the people of the United States in a timely manner, thereby lowering overall prescription drug costs for patients and taxpayers by billions of dollars each year. (3) In order for these pathways to function as intended, developers of generic drugs and biosimilar biological products (referred to in this section as ``generic product developers'') must be able to obtain quantities of the reference listed drug or biological product with which the generic drug or biosimilar biological product is intended to compete (referred to in this section as a ``covered product'') for purposes of supporting an application for approval by the Food and Drug Administration, including for testing to show that-- (A) a prospective generic drug is bioequivalent to the covered product in accordance with subsection (j) of section 505 of the Federal, Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355), or meets the requirements for approval of an application submitted under subsection (b)(2) of that section; or (B) a prospective biosimilar biological product is biosimilar to or interchangeable with its reference biological product under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262(k)), as applicable. (4) For drugs and biological products that are subject to a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, another essential component in the creation of low-cost generic and biosimilar versions of covered products is the ability of generic product developers to join the manufacturer of the covered product (referred to in this section as the ``license holder'') in a single, shared system of elements to assure safe use and supporting agreements, or secure a variance therefrom, as required by section 505-1 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355-1). (5) Contrary to the policy of the United States to promote competition in the market for drugs and biological products by facilitating the timely entry of lower-cost generic and biosimilar versions of those drugs and biological products, certain license holders are preventing generic product developers from obtaining quantities of the covered product necessary for the generic product developer to support an application for approval by the Food and Drug Administration, including testing to show bioequivalence, biosimilarity, or interchangeability to the covered product, in some instances based on the justification that the covered product is subject to a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy with elements to assure safe use under section 505-1 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355-1). (6) The Director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research at the Food and Drug Administration has testified that some manufacturers of covered products have used REMS and distribution restrictions adopted by the manufacturer on their own behalf as reasons to not sell quantities of a covered product to generic product developers, causing barriers and delays in getting generic products on the market. The Food and Drug [[Page S6715]] Administration has reported receiving significant numbers of inquiries from generic product developers who were unable to obtain samples of covered products to conduct necessary testing and otherwise meet requirements for approval of generic drugs. (7) The Chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission has testified that the Federal Trade Commission continues to be very concerned about potential abuses by manufacturers of brand drugs of REMS or other closed distribution systems to impede generic competition. (8) Also contrary to the policy of the United States to promote competition in the market for drugs and biological products by facilitating the timely entry of lower-cost generic and biosimilar versions of those drugs and biological products, certain license holders are impeding the prompt negotiation and development on commercially reasonable terms of a single, shared system of elements to assure safe use, which may be necessary for the generic product developer to gain approval for its drug or licensing for its biological product. (9) While the antitrust laws may address the refusal by some license holders to provide quantities of a covered product to a generic product developer, a more tailored legal pathway would help ensure that generic product developers can obtain necessary quantities of a covered product in a timely way for purposes of developing a generic drug or biosimilar biological product, facilitating competition in the marketplace for drugs and biological products. (10) The antitrust laws may address actions by license holders who impede the prompt negotiation and development of a single, shared system of elements to assure safe use, and the Food and Drug Administration has some authority to waive the requirement of a single, shared system. Clearer regulatory authority to approve different systems that meet the statutory requirements to ensure patient safety, however, would limit the effectiveness of bad faith negotiations over single, shared systems to delay generic approval. At the same time, clearer regulatory authority would ensure all systems protect patient safety. SEC. 3203. ACTIONS FOR DELAYS OF GENERIC DRUGS AND BIOSIMILAR BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS. (a) Definitions.--In this section-- (1) the term ``covered product''-- (A) means-- (i) any drug approved under subsection (b) or (j) of section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355) or biological product licensed under subsection (a) or (k) of section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262); (ii) any combination of a drug or biological product described in clause (i); or (iii) when reasonably necessary to demonstrate sameness, biosimilarity, or interchangeability for purposes of section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355), or section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262), as applicable, any product, including any device, that is marketed or intended for use with such drug or biological product; and (B) does not include any drug or biological product that the Secretary has determined to be currently in shortage and that appears on the drug shortage list in effect under section 506E of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 356e), unless the shortage will not be promptly resolved-- (i) as demonstrated by the fact that the drug or biological product has been in shortage for more than 6 months; or (ii) as otherwise determined by the Secretary; (2) the term ``device'' has the meaning given the term in section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321); (3) the term ``eligible product developer'' means a person that seeks to develop a product for approval pursuant to an application for approval under subsection (b)(2) or (j) of section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355) or for licensing pursuant to an application under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262(k)); (4) the term ``license holder'' means the holder of an application approved under subsection (c) or (j) of section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355) or the holder of a license under subsection (a) or (k) of section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262) for a covered product; (5) the term ``REMS'' means a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy under section 505-1 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355-1); (6) the term ``REMS with ETASU'' means a REMS that contains elements to assure safe use under section 505-1 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355-1); (7) the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Health and Human Services; (8) the term ``single, shared system of elements to assure safe use'' means a single, shared system of elements to assure safe use under section 505-1 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355-1); and (9) the term ``sufficient quantities'' means an amount of a covered product that allows the eligible product developer to-- (A) conduct testing to support an application-- (i) for approval under subsection (b)(2) or (j) of section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355); or (ii) for licensing under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262(k)); and (B) fulfill any regulatory requirements relating to such an application for approval or licensing.

Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Ms. Klobuchar, and Mr. Lee) submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to the bill H.R. 34, to authorize and strengthen the tsunami detection, forecast, warning, research, and mitigation program of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and for other purposes; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows: At the end of title III of division A, add the following: Subtitle K--CREATES Act SEC. 3201. SHORT TITLE. This subtitle may be cited as the ``Creating and Restoring Equal Access to Equivalent Samples Act of 2016'' or the ``CREATES Act of 2016''. SEC. 3202. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) It is the policy of the United States to promote competition in the market for drugs and biological products by facilitating the timely entry of low-cost generic and biosimilar versions of those drugs and biological products. (2) Since their enactment in 1984 and 2010, respectively, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-417; 98 Stat. 1585) and the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (Subtitle A of title VII of Public Law 111-148; 124 Stat. 804), have provided pathways for making lower-cost versions of previously approved drugs and previously licensed biological products available to the people of the United States in a timely manner, thereby lowering overall prescription drug costs for patients and taxpayers by billions of dollars each year. (3) In order for these pathways to function as intended, developers of generic drugs and biosimilar biological products (referred to in this section as ``generic product developers'') must be able to obtain quantities of the reference listed drug or biological product with which the generic drug or biosimilar biological product is intended to compete (referred to in this section as a ``covered product'') for purposes of supporting an application for approval by the Food and Drug Administration, including for testing to show that-- (A) a prospective generic drug is bioequivalent to the covered product in accordance with subsection (j) of section 505 of the Federal, Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355), or meets the requirements for approval of an application submitted under subsection (b)(2) of that section; or (B) a prospective biosimilar biological product is biosimilar to or interchangeable with its reference biological product under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262(k)), as applicable. (4) For drugs and biological products that are subject to a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, another essential component in the creation of low-cost generic and biosimilar versions of covered products is the ability of generic product developers to join the manufacturer of the covered product (referred to in this section as the ``license holder'') in a single, shared system of elements to assure safe use and supporting agreements, or secure a variance therefrom, as required by section 505-1 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355-1). (5) Contrary to the policy of the United States to promote competition in the market for drugs and biological products by facilitating the timely entry of lower-cost generic and biosimilar versions of those drugs and biological products, certain license holders are preventing generic product developers from obtaining quantities of the covered product necessary for the generic product developer to support an application for approval by the Food and Drug Administration, including testing to show bioequivalence, biosimilarity, or interchangeability to the covered product, in some instances based on the justification that the covered product is subject to a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy with elements to assure safe use under section 505-1 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355-1). (6) The Director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research at the Food and Drug Administration has testified that some manufacturers of covered products have used REMS and distribution restrictions adopted by the manufacturer on their own behalf as reasons to not sell quantities of a covered product to generic product developers, causing barriers and delays in getting generic products on the market. The Food and Drug [[Page S6715]] Administration has reported receiving significant numbers of inquiries from generic product developers who were unable to obtain samples of covered products to conduct necessary testing and otherwise meet requirements for approval of generic drugs. (7) The Chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission has testified that the Federal Trade Commission continues to be very concerned about potential abuses by manufacturers of brand drugs of REMS or other closed distribution systems to impede generic competition. (8) Also contrary to the policy of the United States to promote competition in the market for drugs and biological products by facilitating the timely entry of lower-cost generic and biosimilar versions of those drugs and biological products, certain license holders are impeding the prompt negotiation and development on commercially reasonable terms of a single, shared system of elements to assure safe use, which may be necessary for the generic product developer to gain approval for its drug or licensing for its biological product. (9) While the antitrust laws may address the refusal by some license holders to provide quantities of a covered product to a generic product developer, a more tailored legal pathway would help ensure that generic product developers can obtain necessary quantities of a covered product in a timely way for purposes of developing a generic drug or biosimilar biological product, facilitating competition in the marketplace for drugs and biological products. (10) The antitrust laws may address actions by license holders who impede the prompt negotiation and development of a single, shared system of elements to assure safe use, and the Food and Drug Administration has some authority to waive the requirement of a single, shared system. Clearer regulatory authority to approve different systems that meet the statutory requirements to ensure patient safety, however, would limit the effectiveness of bad faith negotiations over single, shared systems to delay generic approval. At the same time, clearer regulatory authority would ensure all systems protect patient safety. SEC. 3203. ACTIONS FOR DELAYS OF GENERIC DRUGS AND BIOSIMILAR BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS.

(6) the director of the center for drug evaluation and research at the food and drug administration has testified that some manufacturers of covered products have used rems and distribution restrictions adopted by the manufacturer on their own behalf as reasons to not sell quantities of a covered product to generic product developers, causing barriers and delays in getting generic products on the market. the food and drug [[page s6715]] administration has reported receiving significant numbers of inquiries from generic product developers who were unable to obtain samples of covered products to conduct necessary testing and otherwise meet requirements for approval of generic drugs. (7) the chairwoman of the federal trade commission has testified that the federal trade commission continues to be very concerned about potential abuses by manufacturers of brand drugs of rems or other closed distribution systems to impede generic competition. (8) also contrary to the policy of the united states to promote competition in the market for drugs and biological products by facilitating the timely entry of lower-cost generic and biosimilar versions of those drugs and biological products, certain license holders are impeding the prompt negotiation and development on commercially reasonable terms of a single, shared system of elements to assure safe use, which may be necessary for the generic product developer to gain approval for its drug or licensing for its biological product. (9) while the antitrust laws may address the refusal by some license holders to provide quantities of a covered product to a generic product developer, a more tailored legal pathway would help ensure that generic product developers can obtain necessary quantities of a covered product in a timely way for purposes of developing a generic drug or biosimilar biological product, facilitating competition in the marketplace for drugs and biological products. (10) the antitrust laws may address actions by license holders who impede the prompt negotiation and development of a single, shared system of elements to assure safe use, and the food and drug administration has some authority to waive the requirement of a single, shared system. clearer regulatory authority to approve different systems that meet the statutory requirements to ensure patient safety, however, would limit the effectiveness of bad faith negotiations over single, shared systems to delay generic approval. at the same time, clearer regulatory authority would ensure all systems protect patient safety. sec. 3203. actions for delays of generic drugs and biosimilar biological products.

WM. LACY CLAY of missouri in the house of representatives Monday, December 5, 2016 Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I delivered the following remarks on behalf of my father, former Congressman William (Bill) Clay, at the funeral of Pearlie Evans on Saturday, November 26, 2016, in St. Louis, Missouri. My friendship with Pearlie spans more than 50 years. During that time we worked together, laughed together, cried together, and raised a lot of hell together. I first met Pearlie Evans in the early 1960s when a close political associate, Arthur Kennedy, introduced us. He and I had just helped A.J. Cervantes get elected. The new mayor asked me to recommend someone to fill the position of Commissioner of Social Services. I invited Pearlie to lunch and offered her the position. She was honored but turned down the offer--telling me of her deep devotion in helping residents at the Fellowship Center and Plymouth House. Without any success, I mentioned that her salary would have been twice that at Fellowship Center and help many more people like those at the Plymouth House. Then, I took her to lunch twice and once to dinner before she agreed. Finally, a well-fed Pearlie Evans accepted the offer and performed exceptionally well in the position. Her background in social work, dealing with grassroots, ghetto residents, allowed her to develop a realistic grasp of the problems faced by low-income, unemployed, poverty stricken individuals. She provided the compassion and know- how in closing the gap that kept many of them from resolving their woes. Having disdain and contempt for all kinds of discrimination and segregation, her agenda was about identifying injustice and reshaping our society until it adjusted to accommodate the needs of its underprivileged. When my first District Director left, I asked Pearlie to run my congressional district office. But this time I knew better than to invite her to lunch or dinner. She accepted and made an ideal District Director for the next 28 years. Perhaps, more than anyone else other than my wife Carol, Pearlie was able to successfully put up with me and all my audaciousness, my insolence, my sarcasm and my bluster. Her simple response of ``ohhhhhhh, Congressman'' more often than not was the perfect tonic to calm a rough or chaotic situation. She was by my side through good times and bad. Her advice and counsel was usually sound. Pearlie was also a pioneer in politics who developed a new strategy for advancing the cause of civil rights and enhancing opportunities. She ushered in the concept that it was time to stop begging for what was ours by citizenship and to start demanding rights that were ours by birth. She played a key role in our developing the political apparatus capable of delivering lopsided margins in electing candidates. She had the unique ability to attract and surround us with people of wisdom, vision, integrity and commitment to racial equality. She joined a cadre of other outstanding women like Gwen Giles, Ruth Porter, Deverne Calloway, Marian Oldham and many others that enabled our group to convince many to overcome their political apathy and to reject disgraceful absentee elected officials pretending to represent our interests. I owe a great deal of my political success to committed and dedicated women like Pearlie. In my elections to Congress, women managed all of my campaigns: Doris Moore, Gwen Giles, Gwen Reed and Pearlie Evans each served as campaign managers in all 16 of them. Pearlie, Virginia Cook, and Gwen Reed also played a key role in electing my son Lacy Clay to Congress. Pearlie journeyed through a career that forced the political system to change the face of our politics and to provide us with people who truly voiced our legitimate concerns. She was always on the picket lines, at the sit-ins, in the marches for school equality, wherever the protests against injustice were being waged. She was there to give active support in campaigns that changed the landscape of bigoted policies and replaced them with opportunities for minorities in St. Louis. Very few lived their life with the enthusiasm, the commitment, the determination, the gusto of Pearlie. She lived every day with the intent of giving back to the community and enhancing the lives of those denied the benefits of humane treatment. In touching their lives, it was a testament to her endearing respect for each individual's humanity. Carol and I join with you in acknowledging that she was an uncommon lady with a phenomenal effect on those of us who were graced by her presence. She was something special, something beautiful, something precious. Although Pearlie would tell us not to shed tears for her but rather for a world that is suffering the ravages of war, disease, hunger and racism--still, without ignoring her request not to shed tears for her passing, we are obligated to shed tears for future generations that will never experience the sight of her doing battle with the giants of society who have profited from exploiting those unable to fight back. We mourn for those who will never bear witness to her unyielding fight against bureaucratic bigots in fighting for racial justice. Yes, Pearlie, when remembering you, what you stood for, how much of your mission is yet unfulfilled, our tears are justified. We cry today because we will have no more tomorrows with you. But we thank God for all the yesterdays we spent with you. We remember all of the good you have done, all of the people you have helped, all of the causes you have championed. We take comfort in the fact that our community, our state and our nation are better as a result of your having been here. We have witnessed in you a towering, incredible, noble, dedicated defender of what's right--so we say in all sincerity--so long, our courageous sister in the struggle for equal justice--so long! ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1581] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PEARLIE EVANS DID MAKE A DIFFERENCE ______ HON.

She had the unique ability to attract and surround us with people of wisdom, vision, integrity and commitment to racial equality. She joined a cadre of other outstanding women like Gwen Giles, Ruth Porter, Deverne Calloway, Marian Oldham and many others that enabled our group to convince many to overcome their political apathy and to reject disgraceful absentee elected officials pretending to represent our interests. I owe a great deal of my political success to committed and dedicated women like Pearlie. In my elections to Congress, women managed all of my campaigns: Doris Moore, Gwen Giles, Gwen Reed and Pearlie Evans each served as campaign managers in all 16 of them. Pearlie, Virginia Cook, and Gwen Reed also played a key role in electing my son Lacy Clay to Congress. Pearlie journeyed through a career that forced the political system to change the face of our politics and to provide us with people who truly voiced our legitimate concerns. She was always on the picket lines, at the sit-ins, in the marches for school equality, wherever the protests against injustice were being waged. She was there to give active support in campaigns that changed the landscape of bigoted policies and replaced them with opportunities for minorities in St. Louis. Very few lived their life with the enthusiasm, the commitment, the determination, the gusto of Pearlie. She lived every day with the intent of giving back to the community and enhancing the lives of those denied the benefits of humane treatment. In touching their lives, it was a testament to her endearing respect for each individual's humanity. Carol and I join with you in acknowledging that she was an uncommon lady with a phenomenal effect on those of us who were graced by her presence. She was something special, something beautiful, something precious. Although Pearlie would tell us not to shed tears for her but rather for a world that is suffering the ravages of war, disease, hunger and racism--still, without ignoring her request not to shed tears for her passing, we are obligated to shed tears for future generations that will never experience the sight of her doing battle with the giants of society who have profited from exploiting those unable to fight back. We mourn for those who will never bear witness to her unyielding fight against bureaucratic bigots in fighting for racial justice. Yes, Pearlie, when remembering you, what you stood for, how much of your mission is yet unfulfilled, our tears are justified. We cry today because we will have no more tomorrows with you. But we thank God for all the yesterdays we spent with you. We remember all of the good you have done, all of the people you have helped, all of the causes you have championed. We take comfort in the fact that our community, our state and our nation are better as a result of your having been here.

WM. LACY CLAY of missouri in the house of representatives Monday, December 5, 2016 Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I delivered the following remarks on behalf of my father, former Congressman William (Bill) Clay, at the funeral of Pearlie Evans on Saturday, November 26, 2016, in St. Louis, Missouri. My friendship with Pearlie spans more than 50 years. During that time we worked together, laughed together, cried together, and raised a lot of hell together. I first met Pearlie Evans in the early 1960s when a close political associate, Arthur Kennedy, introduced us. He and I had just helped A.J. Cervantes get elected. The new mayor asked me to recommend someone to fill the position of Commissioner of Social Services. I invited Pearlie to lunch and offered her the position. She was honored but turned down the offer--telling me of her deep devotion in helping residents at the Fellowship Center and Plymouth House. Without any success, I mentioned that her salary would have been twice that at Fellowship Center and help many more people like those at the Plymouth House. Then, I took her to lunch twice and once to dinner before she agreed. Finally, a well-fed Pearlie Evans accepted the offer and performed exceptionally well in the position. Her background in social work, dealing with grassroots, ghetto residents, allowed her to develop a realistic grasp of the problems faced by low-income, unemployed, poverty stricken individuals. She provided the compassion and know- how in closing the gap that kept many of them from resolving their woes. Having disdain and contempt for all kinds of discrimination and segregation, her agenda was about identifying injustice and reshaping our society until it adjusted to accommodate the needs of its underprivileged. When my first District Director left, I asked Pearlie to run my congressional district office. But this time I knew better than to invite her to lunch or dinner. She accepted and made an ideal District Director for the next 28 years. Perhaps, more than anyone else other than my wife Carol, Pearlie was able to successfully put up with me and all my audaciousness, my insolence, my sarcasm and my bluster. Her simple response of ``ohhhhhhh, Congressman'' more often than not was the perfect tonic to calm a rough or chaotic situation. She was by my side through good times and bad. Her advice and counsel was usually sound. Pearlie was also a pioneer in politics who developed a new strategy for advancing the cause of civil rights and enhancing opportunities. She ushered in the concept that it was time to stop begging for what was ours by citizenship and to start demanding rights that were ours by birth.

Montague Cobb Research Laboratory, which maintains a national repository for African-American skeletal remains. Mr. Clarke also participated in research at Bahir Dar University in Ethiopia through a Howard University-National Science Foundation grant. As an Amgen Scholar, he conducted research at the National Institutes of Health's Center for Cancer Research. Mr. Clarke is a certified emergency medical technician (EMT) and is the lead author on five out of six publications. He is co-president of Howard University's chapter of the Peer Health Exchange and a news editor of The Hilltop, the Howard University student newspaper.

With his Rhodes scholarship, Mr. Clarke intends to further his studies by pursuing a Master of Science degree with an emphasis in primary health care. Ultimately, Mr. Clarke wants to attend medical school and work in public health policy and clinical research. ``We are extremely proud of Mr. Clarke's accomplishments,'' said Dr. Wayne Frederick, President of Howard University. ``Mr. Clarke's academic pursuits will lead to solutions in the broader society that are needed ever more so today. Cameron is the epitome of Howard University's gift of solutions to the world.'' His achievements demonstrate what a person committed to excellence in truth and service can obtain when provided the opportunity.

BLAINE LUETKEMEYER of missouri in the house of representatives Monday, December 5, 2016 Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Esther Louise Hill. She celebrated her 100th birthday on Sunday, December 4th, 2016. Esther Louise Hill was born in Montgomery City, Missouri on December 4, 1916 to Roy and Emma Patterson. She has lived in Jonesburg, Missouri most of her life. Esther married Richard Hill, who is now deceased. She graduated from a three-year program in 1938 from Missouri Baptist Hospital School of Nursing as a registered nurse. Her work experiences were in various divisions of healthcare: hospitals, industry, and public health. Esther started her career as a private duty nurse and after a year decided to join the Barnes Hospital Nursing Staff. Before World War II started, Esther moved to Dallas, Texas. She utilized her nursing degree by working at a substation with North American Aviation during the war. After the end of the war, Esther moved back to Missouri and joined the staff at a local nursing home, Katy Jane, located in Warrenton, Missouri. Unfortunately, during her time at Katy Jane, there was a devastating fire which had a profound effect on Esther. Esther started working as a public health nurse through the state of Missouri, first in Warren County and then moving to Montgomery County. She was moved by the loss of life at Katy Jane and realized commonsense steps could have prevented that tragedy. Eventually, Esther obtained the position of Institutional Advisory Nurse, covering fifteen counties along the Missouri River. In this position, Esther taught nursing home caregivers the details of Missouri state law and procedures that should be part of nursing home care. The Institutional Advisory Nurse position led to a role with the Missouri Department of Health Licensure Program for Nursing Homes. With this position, she taught, investigated and inspected nursing home facilities, and enforced licensure laws. Esther worked for the Visiting Nurse Association for a few years but eventually returned to the Missouri Department of Health. She ended her nursing career with the Missouri Department of Health. Esther appreciates the opportunity she was given to have a career that came full circle; from her days at the Katy Jane Nursing Home where lack of structure allowed for a tragedy, to being involved with the adoption of solutions to protect the most vulnerable. In addition to her successful career in nursing, Esther also taught at Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana. Esther has been a lifelong member of the Jonesburg United Methodist Church and during her time there has enjoyed participating in the Methodist Women organization. In her spare time, she enjoys reading, collecting antiques, cooking, and canning produce from her garden. She also has a passion for hybridized lilies and has even won prizes for them. Esther enjoys a good card game and has been a member of the Canasta Card Club for 50 years. Please join me in recognizing Esther Louise Hill on the occasion of her 100th birthday. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1582] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING ESTHER LOUISE HILL ON THE OCCASION OF HER 100TH BIRTHDAY ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I am honored to stand before you today to recognize Mr. Jim Harris of Wausau, Wisconsin for his exceptional service to others. Mr. Harris worked for more than 30 years in education. First, as a teacher in the Wisconsin Indian Teacher Corps, where he taught children of the Ho Chunk Tribe, and later as one of the first male kindergarten teachers in Wisconsin. Along his journey in education, Mr. Harris also spent two decades as a school administrator and an activist for public health. During his many years of service in education, Mr. Harris got to know the children of Hmong Refugees who fled war in their home country to seek a better life in Wisconsin. Our state has a vibrant Hmong community that Mr. Harris has grown close to. He founded We Help War Victims, a nonprofit organization, with his wife, Marty, also a public school educator. Founded over 30 years ago, We Help War Victims has been working with refugee families in the Wausau, Wisconsin area, providing dozens of Lao schools with their first libraries, and helping families receive access to medical care. Since 2006, his organization has been working with villagers in Laos to destroy land mines, bombs, rockets, mortars, and other unexploded ordnance. Mr. Harris' example directly inspired me to fight for this cause in Congress and his advice has directly affected the focus of my efforts. Countless farmers and families across Laos live in safer communities because of Mr. Harris' work and my community in Wisconsin has been strengthened by the work he and his wife do through We Help War Victims. Mr. Speaker, please join me today to congratulate Mr. Harris on his accomplishments and work on behalf of others.

RICHARD HUDSON of north carolina in the house of representatives Monday, December 5, 2016 Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of Sergeant 1st Class John Mims of the 82nd Airborne Division, a World War II veteran and Bataan Death March survivor who passed away on Sunday, November 27, 2016. Sergeant Mims was a true American hero and our thoughts and prayers go out to his friends and family as they mourn the loss of this great man. When his country needed him the most, it was John Mims who answered the call to serve our great nation. After losing his father when he was young, Mims lied about his age in order to join the Army. At the age of 15, Mims served for nearly a year before the Army discovered his true age and discharged him. However, a few short years later Mims re- enlisted in the Army and headed out to the Philippines to begin his training. After a year in the Philippines, Mims fought alongside his brothers in arms in the Battle of Bataan which culminated in the surrender of 75,000 allied soldiers. The men were then forced to march 65 miles, without food or water, to a prisoner-of-war camp in the Tarlac Province in what became known as the Bataan Death March. One of the greatest atrocities of the entire war, the men suffered beatings, endured torture, and witnessed unimaginable horrors as he faced what can only be described as a living hell. In total more than 10,000 men died during the trek. Following the war, Mims continued his service in the Army, returning to Japan from 1952 to 1954 as sergeant in charge of the Tokyo Quartermaster Depot. After he retired in 1963, he returned home where he worked in a rug factory and a curtain company. Living in Aberdeen, North Carolina, he became an advocate for other veterans and was a constant presence at ceremonies remembering his fallen comrades. His work in the community made certain that the memories of those lost were not forgotten, and it is that legacy which we celebrate today. While we may have lost this great man, his legacy will live on and we will never forget the sacrifices made by Sergeant Mims or any of those who fought to protect our freedoms against unimaginable dangers. Mr. Speaker, please join me today in commemorating the life of Sergeant 1st Class John Mims for his service to God and country. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1583] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN HONOR OF SERGEANT 1ST CLASS JOHN MIMS _____ HON.

JOE COURTNEY of connecticut in the house of representatives Monday, December 5, 2016 Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank an outstanding public servant for his many years of service to my home state of Connecticut. For ten years, Mr. Andrew Maynard has served as State Senator for the state's 18th Senate district, which includes Griswold, Groton, Stonington, Plainfield, Preston, North Stonington, Sterling and Voluntown. His retirement at the end of his term will conclude a distinguished career of public service that began at the local level many years ago as a borough warden in the Town of Stonington. Andy has been a powerful voice for southeastern Connecticut, earning the respect of both Democratic and Republican colleagues and serving as the Deputy Majority Leader for the Senate Democrats since 2011. Andy currently serves as chair of the Transportation Committee, and a member of the Internship and Program Review & Investigation Committees. He also served as chair of the Select Committee on Veterans' Affairs, and a member of the Environment Committee. Andy's unwavering advocacy for our region's natural resources and tourist attractions brought to life the long-delayed Thames River Heritage Park and secured millions of dollars for expansion at the Mystic Seaport, our nation's leading maritime museum. Andy understood the integral role of tourism, not only within the state, but within our region. It was this understanding that guided his leadership as he fought to secure the crucial funding need to dredge the Mystic River and spearhead the Connecticut Treasures program. Our region will miss Andy's advocacy on the floor of the State Senate, but I am sure he will remain a strong and respected voice in his community. A true gentleman, Andy brought a thoughtful, civilized tone in his campaigns for office and his bipartisan camaraderie which characterized his style in office. I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Andy for his tenure as an accomplished public servant, and wish him well in his future endeavors. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1584] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN HONOR OF SENATOR ANDREW MAYNARD UPON HIS RETIREMENT _____ HON.

Over the next 10 years, he became a successful businessman, passionate about building, developing, and creating new ideas, businesses, and adventures. After raising his three children, he looked to a life of public service. He served two terms as a State Representative and two terms as a State Senator where he served as the Chairman of the Senate Health Policy Committee. Passionate about promoting business, encouraging tourism, and promoting conservation, John was respected by his colleagues on both sides of the isle. Upon retiring from the legislature, John married his wife of 19 years Lisa Dailey. Living in the small community of Port Austin, their family grew to include five beautiful grandchildren and three great- grandchildren. In the close-knit community of Port Austin, John was passionate about beautifying and developing the harbor and waterfront, creating spaces the entire community could come together and enjoy, such as a thriving local farmer's market.

CHRIS VAN HOLLEN of maryland in the house of representatives Tuesday, November 29, 2016 Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I submit this statement in support of H.R. 5047, the Protecting Veterans' Educational Choice Act of 2016. I will be unable to submit my recorded vote but I fully support this legislation that ensures that veterans will not be unwittingly exploited by deceptive recruiters. H.R. 5047 is a bipartisan bill that reinforces our commitment to the success of our service members, on and off the battlefield. The bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to supply all information regarding articulation agreements to service members who wish to use their VA education benefits. The bill will inform service members, in advance, if and how they can transfer credits and avoid unwittingly misusing their VA education benefits. In 2010, Congress passed the Post-9/11 Veterans Education Assistance Improvements Act which expanded educational benefits to include more service members and allows them to use their benefits to receive not only traditional degrees but also apprenticeships, vocational training certifications, and on-the-job training. This expansion was vital in providing access to a variety of educational platforms but some for- profit institutions focused on recruiting and scamming service members out of their benefits. H.R. 5047 provides education career counseling to make sure service members are informed of their options. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1584] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PROTECTING VETERANS' EDUCATIONAL CHOICE ACT OF 2016 ______ speech of HON.

The bill will inform service members, in advance, if and how they can transfer credits and avoid unwittingly misusing their VA education benefits. In 2010, Congress passed the Post-9/11 Veterans Education Assistance Improvements Act which expanded educational benefits to include more service members and allows them to use their benefits to receive not only traditional degrees but also apprenticeships, vocational training certifications, and on-the-job training. This expansion was vital in providing access to a variety of educational platforms but some for- profit institutions focused on recruiting and scamming service members out of their benefits. H.R. 5047 provides education career counseling to make sure service members are informed of their options. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1584] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PROTECTING VETERANS' EDUCATIONAL CHOICE ACT OF 2016 ______ speech of HON.

BARBARA LEE of california in the house of representatives Monday, December 5, 2016 Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the City of Refuge UCC upon its 25th anniversary for its legacy of promoting community building, inclusion, and faith in the Bay Area. First established in San Francisco, the City of Refuge was founded in 1991 by a group of primarily gay and lesbian Christians with the goal of establishing a church that did not adhere to the exclusion of people based on gender or sexual orientation. Three years later in 1994, the City of Refuge joined the United Church of Christ (UCC) and became incorporated with over 5,000 churches worldwide working to uphold the denomination's commitment to social justice. Founder and Senior Pastor Reverend Dr. Yvette A. Flunder has been nationally recognized for her work to promote the inclusion of gay and lesbian parishioners and to minister to their specific needs. In response to the AIDS epidemic, Rev. Dr. Flunder established the Ark of Refuge, a non-profit organization that provided direct services to homeless and low-income individuals, and also created the Hazard-Ashley House and Walker House in Oakland as a means to provide housing services, education, and training for people affected by HIV/AIDS. In 2000, she created the Fellowship of Affirming Ministries, a network of more than 100 primarily African American churches around the world that work to promote ``radical inclusivity'', whereby the ministry is open to all without prejudice or discrimination. In 2013 the City of Refuge UCC relocated to Oakland. Through the hard work and dedication of the ministry, staff, and congregation, community members and in particular women, immigrants, and those who identify as LGBTQ, have found a safe space for self-expression, belonging, and religious participation. Through the Church's various ministries, this community provides support for those needing help addressing substance abuse, homelessness, HIV/AIDS treatment, and environmental justice. On behalf of California's 13th Congressional District, I would like to congratulate the City of Refuge UCC on this important milestone, and thank the community for the many valuable services that they provide to those in need. I wish the congregation continued success in upholding its commitment to social justice and expanding the radical inclusivity that has come to be the City of Refuge's hallmark. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1585] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING CITY OF REFUGE UCC _____ HON.

Romania is celebrating the anniversary of its unification on December 1, 1918. Romania is a loyal U.S. and NATO ally. Romania and the United States work closely together to confront a host of global challenges, including through our joint efforts to bolster regional defense, halt nuclear proliferation, and increase energy security. With the signing of the U.S.-Romania Ballistic Missile Defense Agreement in September 2011, Romania established itself as a key strategic partner in NATO's emerging missile defense capabilities effort. The Missile Defense Interceptor site at Deveselu Air Base near the Bulgarian border, which became operational in May 2016, now provides missile defense protection to our allies in Europe and the Middle East. Tragically, ongoing events in Ukraine are unsettling the region and testing the transatlantic alliance. As you know, Russia seeks to once again destabilize much of Eastern Europe and restore influence over territories lost following the collapse of the Soviet Union. That is why it is critically important for the United States, Romania, and other European allies to continue to work together to strengthen the transatlantic alliance and bolster regional security. The strategic partnership between the United States and Romania has greatly advanced our common interests in promoting transatlantic and regional security and free market opportunities. Our partnership should continue to foster greater economic and cultural exchanges, trade and investment, and social contacts.

SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Wednesday, November 30, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1555, the ``Filipino Veterans of World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2015.'' S. 1555 honors the brave Filipino soldiers who courageously fought for freedom in World War II by awarding the highest honor that this Congress can bestow. More than 260,000 Filipino veterans, 18,000 of who are still alive today, who for decades had to fight for benefits and recognition, will now receive the recognition they have earned and deserve. These Filipino soldiers were instrumental to the United States efforts in the Pacific. After the invasion of the Philippines by Japanese forces they retired to the Bataan Peninsula and continued to fight valiantly. Among these brave soldiers is Dominador Soriano, a resident of San Antonio, Texas, who fought as a member of both the Philippine and United States Armies. He was drafted into the Philippine Army in 1938 and then inducted into the U.S. Army in the Far East on September 1, 1941. Under the leadership of General Douglas MacArthur, Soriano commanded the Echo Company of the 83rd Infantry Regiment, keeping watch on Japanese ships moving through the Tanon Strait. During the Japanese invasion he was shot and in July of 1944 was captured, beaten and then released, but could barely walk. Soriano continued working with the resistance until the surrender of the Japanese on August 15, 1945. Recently, the city of San Antonio honored Soriano and other Filipino veterans with a resolution that recognized their efforts during World War II and supported legislation to award these courageous men the Congressional Gold Medal. The resolution is the first of its kind by any city in the United States, and I believe that it is time for Congress to follow suit. These brave Filipino soldiers answered President Franklin D. Roosevelt's call to serve in World War II and they deserve the highest award that we can give, for there is no higher duty than putting one's life on the line for freedom and country. For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1555 the ``Filipino Veterans of World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2015.'' ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1585] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FILIPINO VETERANS OF WORLD WAR II CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL ACT OF 2015 ______ speech of HON.

SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Wednesday, November 30, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1555, the ``Filipino Veterans of World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2015.'' S. 1555 honors the brave Filipino soldiers who courageously fought for freedom in World War II by awarding the highest honor that this Congress can bestow. More than 260,000 Filipino veterans, 18,000 of who are still alive today, who for decades had to fight for benefits and recognition, will now receive the recognition they have earned and deserve. These Filipino soldiers were instrumental to the United States efforts in the Pacific. After the invasion of the Philippines by Japanese forces they retired to the Bataan Peninsula and continued to fight valiantly. Among these brave soldiers is Dominador Soriano, a resident of San Antonio, Texas, who fought as a member of both the Philippine and United States Armies. He was drafted into the Philippine Army in 1938 and then inducted into the U.S. Army in the Far East on September 1, 1941. Under the leadership of General Douglas MacArthur, Soriano commanded the Echo Company of the 83rd Infantry Regiment, keeping watch on Japanese ships moving through the Tanon Strait. During the Japanese invasion he was shot and in July of 1944 was captured, beaten and then released, but could barely walk. Soriano continued working with the resistance until the surrender of the Japanese on August 15, 1945. Recently, the city of San Antonio honored Soriano and other Filipino veterans with a resolution that recognized their efforts during World War II and supported legislation to award these courageous men the Congressional Gold Medal. The resolution is the first of its kind by any city in the United States, and I believe that it is time for Congress to follow suit. These brave Filipino soldiers answered President Franklin D. Roosevelt's call to serve in World War II and they deserve the highest award that we can give, for there is no higher duty than putting one's life on the line for freedom and country.

During World War II, he applied for military service, but unfortunately he lost most of his hearing in his left ear due to a diving accident he suffered from, and was unable to serve. Anthony still wanted to contribute to the country in whatever way possible, so he volunteered for civilian duty as an Air Raid Warden and served in this position until the end of the war. Air Raid Wardens were vital in ensuring the safety of everyone in the neighborhood and he did not take his role lightly. He returned to Malta in 1948, met the love of his life, and returned to the United States to start their new life together. Anthony's exemplary life of service was motivated and fueled by his love of God, family, and country. He was a humble man who lived on a modest income and was very proud of his service as an Air Raid Warden. The service these dedicated civilians provided was vital in keeping civilians safe.

SUSAN W. BROOKS of indiana in the house of representatives Monday, December 5, 2016 Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an outstanding educator, Superintendent Nathaniel Jones of the Metropolitan School District of Pike Township. Superintendent Jones is retiring after 43 years of exceptional service to students and the community. The people of the Fifth Congressional District of Indiana are forever grateful for Superintendent Jones' contributions and commitment to the students of the Pike Township School District and to our Hoosier community. Superintendent Jones is an Indianapolis native. He received his formal education from the Indianapolis Public School (IPS) system. After graduating high school Superintendent Jones went to Indiana University where he pursued his interest in education. Upon completion of his B.S. in Elementary Education, he returned to IPS where he taught elementary school as well as adult education classes for five years. He returned to IUPUI to earn his M.S. in Education as well as an Administrative Certificate. In 1978, Superintendent Jones was named Assistant Principal to John Strange Elementary School of the Metropolitan School District of Washington Township, and shortly thereafter in 1980 he was named Principal of Delaware Trail Elementary, at age 27, making him one of the youngest principals in the state of Indiana. He served the Washington Township School system in a variety of positions over 25 years; he served Washington Township as Principal, Director of Elementary Education, and as Assistant Superintendent of Curriculum and Instruction. His leadership proved truly transformational as every school he led as Principal attained state and national recognition for academic achievement. In 1982, he earned his Education Specialist Degree in School Administration from Indiana University, Bloomington and in 1994 his Superintendent Certification. In 2003, he became the first African American to accept the role of Superintendent for the Metropolitan School District of Pike Township and the first African American IPS graduate to be a Superintendent in the state of Indiana. Superintendent Jones has been instrumental in creating positive change in each of the school systems he has served. Pike High School in particular has made monumental strides under Superintendent Jones' leadership. Pike High School has one of the most successful pre- collegiate programs in Indiana with over 85 percent of students attending post-secondary institutions upon graduating from high school and has a graduation rate of over 91 percent. In 2005, the Standard & Poor's ratings recognized Pike High School for significantly narrowing the Black-white and Hispanic-white achievement gaps. During Superintendent Jones' tenure the number of scholarships and grants received by Pike students has grown tremendously. Pike High School boasts the highest number of Gates Scholars in Indiana. Superintendent Jones also implemented the STEM Center and spearheaded major construction and renovation of many facilities, and earned over $75 million in Federal Competitive Grants from 2005 through 2015. Superintendent Jones' tireless efforts to seek educational grants and funding opportunities helped in part to create the Youth CareerConnect program. This program offers work-based learning opportunities that teaches students marketable and useful STEM skills empowering students in future learning as well as career opportunities. Through the collaboration of Superintendent Jones' visionary leadership, the help of a supportive board, dedicated administrators, extraordinary teachers, and engaged parents, Pike Township schools have become a more positive learning environment where student achievement continues to soar. Throughout his career Superintendent Jones has received numerous awards that recognize the accomplishments and contributions he has made to education in our community. From Indiana University he received two ``Distinguished Alumni Awards''. In 1996, he earned the Milken Award, which aims to grant funds to accomplished mid-career educators. He received the Achiever Award from the Center for Leadership, is a recipient of a Sagamore of the Wabash Award, has received a Congressional Salute, and he received two District of Distinction awards. He was selected as one of the 100 top administrators in North America by the ``Executive Educator'' and has received over 60 local, state, and national awards for his leadership and innovative approach to educating students, teachers, and the community. His award winning work is well regarded not only from these institutions but from his peers and fellow educators. He has been invited to conduct and participate in numerous conferences throughout the United States. In addition, he is a lifetime member of the NAACP and in 2011 he was featured in the ``Education Executive Publication'' as a Trendsetter, and in a Who's Who in ``Black Indianapolis''. Superintendent Jones continues to serve the community through his roles on numerous boards. He currently sits on the Board of Directors for American Heart Association, he was the Chair for National Council on Educating Black Children Conference in 2015, and he was the Board Chairman for Conner Prairie in 2011. In 2008, he served on the Indianapolis Marion-County Public Library Board of Directors and the Teachers' Treasures Board of Directors. He was the coordinator for the Lilly Initiative supported by the Lilly Endowment in 2000 through 2003. He was on the State Advisory Committee on Textbook Adoption in 2001 through 2003. I am proud to thank Superintendent Jones for his service in helping the students of Pike Township graduate from high school with the essential skills necessary to be confident, creative, productive, and prosperous in college, careers, and life. He has always put the needs of students first throughout his educational career and truly enriched the lives of so many. He takes great pride in addressing the individual needs of the children he serves. Superintendent Jones never overlooked the fact that his students come to him from a variety of backgrounds, possessing individual gifts, talents, challenges and dreams. On behalf of all Hoosiers and the nation, I'd like to congratulate Superintendent Nathaniel Jones on his success and wish him, his wife Cynthia, two children, and their families all the best as Superintendent Jones enjoys a well-deserved retirement [[Page E1587]] ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1586-E1587] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PAYING TRIBUTE TO NATHANIEL JONES ON HIS RETIREMENT _____ HON.

This program offers work-based learning opportunities that teaches students marketable and useful STEM skills empowering students in future learning as well as career opportunities. Through the collaboration of Superintendent Jones' visionary leadership, the help of a supportive board, dedicated administrators, extraordinary teachers, and engaged parents, Pike Township schools have become a more positive learning environment where student achievement continues to soar. Throughout his career Superintendent Jones has received numerous awards that recognize the accomplishments and contributions he has made to education in our community. From Indiana University he received two ``Distinguished Alumni Awards''. In 1996, he earned the Milken Award, which aims to grant funds to accomplished mid-career educators.

He was selected as one of the 100 top administrators in North America by the ``Executive Educator'' and has received over 60 local, state, and national awards for his leadership and innovative approach to educating students, teachers, and the community. His award winning work is well regarded not only from these institutions but from his peers and fellow educators. He has been invited to conduct and participate in numerous conferences throughout the United States. In addition, he is a lifetime member of the NAACP and in 2011 he was featured in the ``Education Executive Publication'' as a Trendsetter, and in a Who's Who in ``Black Indianapolis''. Superintendent Jones continues to serve the community through his roles on numerous boards. He currently sits on the Board of Directors for American Heart Association, he was the Chair for National Council on Educating Black Children Conference in 2015, and he was the Board Chairman for Conner Prairie in 2011. In 2008, he served on the Indianapolis Marion-County Public Library Board of Directors and the Teachers' Treasures Board of Directors. He was the coordinator for the Lilly Initiative supported by the Lilly Endowment in 2000 through 2003. He was on the State Advisory Committee on Textbook Adoption in 2001 through 2003. I am proud to thank Superintendent Jones for his service in helping the students of Pike Township graduate from high school with the essential skills necessary to be confident, creative, productive, and prosperous in college, careers, and life. He has always put the needs of students first throughout his educational career and truly enriched the lives of so many. He takes great pride in addressing the individual needs of the children he serves.

SUSAN W. BROOKS of indiana in the house of representatives Monday, December 5, 2016 Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an outstanding educator, Superintendent Nathaniel Jones of the Metropolitan School District of Pike Township. Superintendent Jones is retiring after 43 years of exceptional service to students and the community. The people of the Fifth Congressional District of Indiana are forever grateful for Superintendent Jones' contributions and commitment to the students of the Pike Township School District and to our Hoosier community. Superintendent Jones is an Indianapolis native. He received his formal education from the Indianapolis Public School (IPS) system. After graduating high school Superintendent Jones went to Indiana University where he pursued his interest in education. Upon completion of his B.S. in Elementary Education, he returned to IPS where he taught elementary school as well as adult education classes for five years. He returned to IUPUI to earn his M.S. in Education as well as an Administrative Certificate. In 1978, Superintendent Jones was named Assistant Principal to John Strange Elementary School of the Metropolitan School District of Washington Township, and shortly thereafter in 1980 he was named Principal of Delaware Trail Elementary, at age 27, making him one of the youngest principals in the state of Indiana. He served the Washington Township School system in a variety of positions over 25 years; he served Washington Township as Principal, Director of Elementary Education, and as Assistant Superintendent of Curriculum and Instruction. His leadership proved truly transformational as every school he led as Principal attained state and national recognition for academic achievement. In 1982, he earned his Education Specialist Degree in School Administration from Indiana University, Bloomington and in 1994 his Superintendent Certification. In 2003, he became the first African American to accept the role of Superintendent for the Metropolitan School District of Pike Township and the first African American IPS graduate to be a Superintendent in the state of Indiana. Superintendent Jones has been instrumental in creating positive change in each of the school systems he has served. Pike High School in particular has made monumental strides under Superintendent Jones' leadership. Pike High School has one of the most successful pre- collegiate programs in Indiana with over 85 percent of students attending post-secondary institutions upon graduating from high school and has a graduation rate of over 91 percent. In 2005, the Standard & Poor's ratings recognized Pike High School for significantly narrowing the Black-white and Hispanic-white achievement gaps. During Superintendent Jones' tenure the number of scholarships and grants received by Pike students has grown tremendously. Pike High School boasts the highest number of Gates Scholars in Indiana.

Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the invaluable service to our community from the leadership of Mr. Doug Siden, and to congratulate him on his retirement from the East Bay Park District Board of Directors. Mr. Siden has served for the past 24 years on the East Bay Regional Park District (EBRPD) Board. During his tenure, Mr. Siden recognized the importance that the East Bay Parks play in the lives of so many local residents, and has worked tirelessly to provide access and an enjoyable experience for visitors to all of the District's 66 locations. As an EBRPD Board member, he worked diligently to help EBRPD pass Measures CC and WW to support and expand the system. At $500 million, Measure WW was the largest bond measure ever awarded to a local district to acquire and develop new parks, and it helped the Park District meet the increasing demand to preserve open space for recreation and wildlife habitat. Mr. Siden served for many years on the East Bay Economic Development Alliance's Executive Board, was a founding member and served as a chairperson of the Martin Luther King Freedom Center in Oakland, and led the fight to establish the Alameda County Creek and Watershed Symposium. Additionally, during his career he has served on the advisory committees of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and Pt. Reyes National Seashore. Mr. Siden is also a longtime Rotarian and has served as a Baptist minister for over six decades. He directed a youth camp for Baptist Churches of the West for 20 years, and led the effort to establish year-round camps in Santa Cruz and near Lake Tahoe. He holds an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from the American Baptist Seminary of the West for his leadership. On a personal note, Doug has been a long-time friend and partner in the East Bay, and I greatly appreciate his leadership and counsel. I wish him well on this new chapter of his life. On behalf of the residents of California's 13th Congressional District, I congratulate Mr. Doug Siden on a well-deserved retirement. We honor his tireless support of open space, parks, and healthy recreation, and also for his vision of a more ideal world in which all can enjoy and benefit from these natural treasures. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1587] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING MR.

CREC-2016-12-05-pt1-PgE1587-3,CREC-2016-12-05,114,BEST OF LUCK TO TEXAS 02'S FOOTBALL TEAMS AT STATE SEMI-FINALS,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1587] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] BEST OF LUCK TO TEXAS 02'S FOOTBALL TEAMS AT STATE SEMI-FINALS _____ HON. TED POE of texas in the house of representatives Monday, December 5, 2016 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, sweet tea, BBQ, and football--these are just some of the things Texans love dearly. From high school football to college football, Texans will come out to every game no matter what the temperature and weather are. Our commitment to our football teams is so strong that preachers will find a way to mention the local team in their sermons and make sure you get home just in time to watch the game with friends and family. Football is a very special part of the culture in Texas. From the stadiums to the food to the different student clubs that gather in the stadiums, football games unite Texans. The bands, the drill teams, the cheerleading teams, the students that form it all--they are an extraordinary group that make the culture and character of Texas so unique in the United States. More than just uniting families and friends, football allows our community to share in the joy of victory and the sadness of temporary defeat; it teaches our children to keep working hard for their goals both individually and with their teammates. Although professional and college football receive the most national attention, high school football is just as important in Texas. I still remember going to my son's football games, from his start at pee-wee leagues to his career playing for my alma mater, Abilene Christian University. Those memories make me even more proud to say that two high schools in my district have met their goals and broken records this season. Atascocita High School is fighting for a chance to compete in the state championship. Last year they had a record-setting playoff run, reaching the Region II-6A Division I final. This year, they raised the bar even higher. With the outstanding sportsmanship of their players, the football team of Atascocita High School has exceeded expectations. I know how proud the players, their parents, and their school must be. Ranking at Number 18 in the state, the Eagles have some of the most promising players on their team. Quarterback Daveon Boyd, now a senior, has received four awards throughout his high school football career. He has surpassed the national average in number of yards, yards per game, touchdown passes, completion percentage, attempts, and interceptions. This season alone, he's had a 63 percent pass rate for 4,139 yards and 46 touchdowns. But Boyd is not the only outstanding player in Atascocita High School. Samuel Cosmi, the offensive tackle, is a University of Houston pledge. Defensive tackles De'Marius Brooks and Kendrix Burford, along with defensive backs Justin Campbell, Alerick Soularie, and Travian Blaylock give the Eagles an edge in size and speed. Another high school in my district, Klein Collins, won its first regional semi-finals at Baylor's McLane Stadium in the Division II Region II-6A playoffs. While all the players have done outstanding work, senior running back D'Anthony Doyle rushed 167 yards and got a couple of touchdowns, making him the hardest working player that game. His teammate, Josh Powell, also earned the team two more scores. At the end of the game, the team's hard work left the team with a 54-16 victory over John Tyler. As a proud dad who beamed in the stands watching his son play, I know how thrilled their parents will be watching them play against Spring Westfield on December 2. I am incredibly proud of the students of the Atascocita and Klein Collins High School football teams for their successes this season. It is great to see students in my district represent us so well with their hard work and talent. I look forward to their upcoming games and seeing them succeed and exceed expectations for years to come. Best of luck at State Semi-Finals. And that's just the way it is. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1587] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] BEST OF LUCK TO TEXAS 02'S FOOTBALL TEAMS AT STATE SEMI-FINALS _____ HON.

Those memories make me even more proud to say that two high schools in my district have met their goals and broken records this season. Atascocita High School is fighting for a chance to compete in the state championship. Last year they had a record-setting playoff run, reaching the Region II-6A Division I final. This year, they raised the bar even higher. With the outstanding sportsmanship of their players, the football team of Atascocita High School has exceeded expectations. I know how proud the players, their parents, and their school must be. Ranking at Number 18 in the state, the Eagles have some of the most promising players on their team. Quarterback Daveon Boyd, now a senior, has received four awards throughout his high school football career. He has surpassed the national average in number of yards, yards per game, touchdown passes, completion percentage, attempts, and interceptions. This season alone, he's had a 63 percent pass rate for 4,139 yards and 46 touchdowns. But Boyd is not the only outstanding player in Atascocita High School. Samuel Cosmi, the offensive tackle, is a University of Houston pledge. Defensive tackles De'Marius Brooks and Kendrix Burford, along with defensive backs Justin Campbell, Alerick Soularie, and Travian Blaylock give the Eagles an edge in size and speed. Another high school in my district, Klein Collins, won its first regional semi-finals at Baylor's McLane Stadium in the Division II Region II-6A playoffs. While all the players have done outstanding work, senior running back D'Anthony Doyle rushed 167 yards and got a couple of touchdowns, making him the hardest working player that game. His teammate, Josh Powell, also earned the team two more scores. At the end of the game, the team's hard work left the team with a 54-16 victory over John Tyler. As a proud dad who beamed in the stands watching his son play, I know how thrilled their parents will be watching them play against Spring Westfield on December 2. I am incredibly proud of the students of the Atascocita and Klein Collins High School football teams for their successes this season. It is great to see students in my district represent us so well with their hard work and talent. I look forward to their upcoming games and seeing them succeed and exceed expectations for years to come. Best of luck at State Semi-Finals. And that's just the way it is. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1587] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] BEST OF LUCK TO TEXAS 02'S FOOTBALL TEAMS AT STATE SEMI-FINALS _____ HON. TED POE of texas in the house of representatives Monday, December 5, 2016 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, sweet tea, BBQ, and football--these are just some of the things Texans love dearly. From high school football to college football, Texans will come out to every game no matter what the temperature and weather are. Our commitment to our football teams is so strong that preachers will find a way to mention the local team in their sermons and make sure you get home just in time to watch the game with friends and family. Football is a very special part of the culture in Texas. From the stadiums to the food to the different student clubs that gather in the stadiums, football games unite Texans. The bands, the drill teams, the cheerleading teams, the students that form it all--they are an extraordinary group that make the culture and character of Texas so unique in the United States. More than just uniting families and friends, football allows our community to share in the joy of victory and the sadness of temporary defeat; it teaches our children to keep working hard for their goals both individually and with their teammates.

The Merchant Marines of World War II were vital in the collective effort to defeat the Axis powers.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay special tribute to Master Sergeant Michael Thomas Donohue, in appreciation of his 30 years of meritorious service in the United States Army, Navy, Navy Reserve, and New York Army National Guard. Throughout his military career, Master Sergeant Donohue has served with honor and distinction in numerous positions, from Aircraft Handler and Tank Mechanic, to Intelligence Analyst and Operations NCOIC, culminating with his service as a Senior Maintenance Supervisor for the 42nd CAB. His unwavering dedication to duty and unparalleled professionalism has consistently earned the respect of subordinates, peers, and superiors alike. An innovative and relentless troubleshooter, his vast technical knowledge greatly aided in his Brigade's success while deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom 08-09. His experience, gained from serving in two combat deployments in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, proved invaluable as he mentored junior non-commissioned officers and officers on a wide spectrum of operational and technical topics, increasing their readiness for deployment and ultimately, unit effectiveness. His long and illustrious career has been marked by humility and service, and reflects great credit upon himself, the New York Army National Guard, United States Army, and United States Navy. MSG Donohue's deployments include Operation El Dorado Canyon (USN, 1986), Operation Ernest Will (USN, 1988), multiple natural disasters (1997-2012), Counter Drug operations (1998-2001), World Trade Center (2001), OIF (2008-2009), and OEF (2012-2013). He provided mentorship and leadership and skillfully groomed the next generation of leaders, which resulted in the Soldier and NCO Warrior of the Year competitions for the Aviation Brigade in 2009, 2010, and 2011 and New York State Soldier of the Year in 2011. His faithfulness through these times was and is a testimony for others to follow, and I would like to take this opportunity to recognize his devotion to our country. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1588] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MASTER SERGEANT MICHAEL THOMAS DONOHUE _____ HON.

TED POE of texas in the house of representatives Monday, December 5, 2016 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, our men and women in blue are the best we have. They are the thin blue line between good and evil. Each day these men and women head out into the field not knowing what they will face, not knowing if their day will be filled with routine traffic stops, or extreme dangers. Our peace officers face the unknown and stand up for the rest of us. Reginald ``Jake'' Gutierrez was one of these men. Gutierrez was responding to a domestic violence call in Tacoma, Washington after a woman approached animal control officers claiming her husband had locked her out of the house and taken her cell phone. Gutierrez and his partner entered the home. Shots rang out as he proceeded up the stairs to speak with the suspect. Two young children were held hostage inside the house, being used as human shields. His partner returned fire, taking the wife to safety. Gutierrez was shot multiple times, his life taken away by a vicious criminal. Gutierrez gave his life to protect the young and innocent. As a veteran of the Department since 1999, 45-year-old Gutierrez was a model police officer. Each day he got up, put on the uniform and badge and dedicated himself to his profession and community. He is now the 132nd officer to die in the line of duty this year alone. At least eight of these deaths occurred while responding to reports of domestic disturbance and violence. Hundreds of individuals came to honor Gutierrez as he made his way from the hospital to the medical examiner's office. The hospital was surrounded by fellow officers standing in support of their fallen brother. The King County Sheriff's Department ordered all Deputies to wear mourning bands in honor of the fallen peace officer. The needless murder of our officers is absolutely unacceptable. These men and women work tirelessly, day in and day out trying to make a difference. It is time to put an end to the needless murder of our peace officers. Congress must stand up for those who work to protect the rest of us. The men and women behind the badge are some of America's best. Officer Reginald ``Jake'' Gutierrez's life may be gone, but his memory serves as a reminder of all those who gave their lives for the thin blue line. And that's just the way it is. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1588] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE THIN BLUE LINE: OFFICER REGINALD GUTIERREZ _____ HON.

SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Monday, December 5, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, World AIDS Day affords us an opportunity to reflect on our progress in the fight against the global AIDS pandemic and to rededicate ourselves to ending the disease once and for all. We have come a long way since the first World AIDS Day in 1988 by dramatically expanding investments in HIV/AIDS prevention, care, treatment, and research. Strong advocacy has paved the way for the Ryan White Act, the Housing Opportunities for People with AIDS Initiative, growing investments in NIH research, and an end to the ban on federal funds for syringe exchange. Beyond our borders, our efforts have extended care to millions in the developing world, through increased resources for PEPFAR and the Global Fund. Our investments have saved lives--preventing millions of new HIV cases, expanding access to improved treatments, and enabling medical advances that help HIV/AIDS patients live longer and healthier. Here and across the globe, AIDS deaths are on the decline, and studies are pointing the way to new approaches to limit the spread of the disease, with treatment as prevention. [[Page E1589]] While our efforts have grown, we still only reach half of all people eligible for HIV treatment; and more must be done. Working together, we must continue to strengthen--not weaken--our national and international efforts to combat AIDS and other infectious diseases. We must work to achieve the Obama Administration's goal of an AIDS- free generation. We must honor the memory of those we have lost and act on our hope, optimism, and determination to end the HIV/AIDS pandemic. We must continue to work with programs and clinics, like the Harris County Hospital District (HCHD), who are treating and caring for patients with HIV/AIDS. In 1989, HCHD opened Thomas Street Health Center, the first free- standing facility dedicated to outpatient HIV/AIDS care in the nation. The center has become the cornerstone of all HIV/AIDS care available to Harris County residents. The Thomas Street Health Center has dedicated their services to about 25 percent of Harris County's HIV/AIDS. Annually, the health center, along with HCHD, serves 4,463 unique patients for about 37,000 patients' visits. We will continue to fight a tough fight against HIV and AIDS. We will continue to strengthen and support centers like Thomas Street Health Center that work diligently with HIV/AIDS patients. Our focus on HIV/AIDS prevention and awareness will be to ensure all of our friends, relatives and children live healthy and full lives. There is a pressing need to raise awareness and engage in education within the African American community where HIV infections have been and continue to rise. The incidence of HIV has decreased for the majority population, while it has grown nearly unchecked among African Americans. This must change--decisions regarding funding for agencies charged with infectious disease education and minority health must be supported. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1588-E1589] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMMEMORATING WORLD AIDS DAY 2016 _____ HON.

SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Wednesday, November 30, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6302, ``The Overtime Pay For Secret Service Agents Act''. This important legislation will provide an increase in premium pay for United States Secret Service agents performing protective services. H.R. 6302 will raise the cap on overtime compensation for U.S. Secret Service agents tasked with the responsibility for protecting the president, vice president and major presidential and vice presidential candidates during campaigns. Under current law, an executive branch employee's premium pay, including overtime combined with basic pay cannot exceed the maximum rate of basic pay for a GS-15 or Level V executive schedule, whichever is greater. The maximum rate for a GS-15 employee in the Washington, D.C., area is set at $160,300 in 2016, while the pay rate for Level V is set at $150,200 adjusted for the current cost of living. H.R. 6302 will increase the pay rate cap by nearly $35,000. The H.R. 6302 will also apply to agents responsible for protecting candidates' spouses, former presidents, their spouses and children, high profile foreign visitors, as well as other government officials. More than 1,000 agents have exceeded the overtime pay limit this year and can greatly benefit from the prospective adjustments. Some by as much as $60,000, according to the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association. For these reasons I support H.R. 6302. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1589] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] OVERTIME PAY FOR SECRET SERVICE AGENTS ACT OF 2016 ______ speech of HON.

She resided in Arlington, Virginia, but was born and raised in my hometown of Worcester, Massachusetts. Her loved ones gathered in Worcester today to honor her life and pay tribute to a truly remarkable woman. Kathleen had a distinguished legal career. After graduating from Assumption College and Boston College School of Law with honors, Kathleen began working in the legal division of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in 1978. She served in the Board's legal division for decades and became a well-known expert in international banking and trade negotiations. Those who knew her best will miss her warmth, wit, and generosity. Scott Alvarez, the Fed's General Counsel, remarked, ``Kathleen was a dedicated employee, serving nearly 40 years in the Board's Legal Division. She was a kind, brilliant, generous, witty, and wonderfully warm friend to all of us, and we will all miss her tremendously.'' Mr. Speaker, Kathleen touched the lives of so many around her, and had a profound impact on all of us through her work with the Federal Reserve.

It is vital that we ensure that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have the resources they need to continue to advance biomedical and mental health research, and improve access to innovative treatments for some of the most debilitating illnesses. The additional $4.8 billion authorized for the NIH to improve biomedical research and treatment innovations is commendable, particularly the $1.8 billion for the Vice President's Cancer Moonshot, in line with the President's budget request, that will advance critical life-saving research. I fully support the Cancer Moonshot's mission to speed up the advancement of other treatments that will help individuals and families who are fighting diseases or disorders. As a Cancer survivor, I know all too well the value of these investments and how many lives can be saved as a result. Additionally, the allocation of $1 billion to step up federal efforts combating the growing opioid and heroin epidemic is a positive step towards better treatment of addicted individuals. Every day, families across California and the nation are torn apart by a loved one or neighbor abusing opioids. Hopefully our Republican colleagues consider this the first of many steps to advance meaningful policies designed to erode the strong grip these drugs have on so many Americans. [[Page E1590]] Unfortunately, key aspects of this legislation fall short and are clearly designed to benefit Big Pharma over American consumers, patients, and doctors. I am deeply troubled by the Majority's decision to drastically reduce new NIH funding in the legislation compared to H.R. 6, stifling new research and vital progress. Additionally, it is disappointing that an amendment I authored, which would have helped to improve doctor-patient communication around the diagnosis and treatment of severe or chronic illnesses, was not included in this legislation. This oversight shows the lack of understanding of the importance of communication between patients and doctors in a patient's treatment and recovery. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1589-E1590] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 34, TSUNAMI WARNING, EDUCATION, AND RESEARCH ACT OF 2015, AND PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 6392, SYSTEMIC RISK DESIGNATION IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2016 ______ speech of HON.

MADELEINE Z. BORDALLO of guam in the house of representatives Friday, December 2, 2016 Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on the Fiscal Year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act, which was passed by a 375-34 vote on Friday. I commend Chairman Thornberry, Ranking Member Smith and the committee staff who worked many long nights on the FY17 NDAA. I worked with Mr. Smith and members of the committee, particularly Readiness Chairman Rob Wittman, to include a number of provisions and funding levels that will address certain readiness shortfalls and continue to support the Asia-Pacific Rebalance. This conference agreement, along with the House report passed in May, includes a number of provisions that are particularly important for the people of Guam. Over the past few months of negotiations, we were able to secure the provision that authorizes the payment of claims to the survivors of the occupation of Guam during World War II and the heirs of those who were killed during the occupation. During World War II, Guam was the only U.S. civilian population occupied by Japan, and during this time our people were subjected to rape, torture, assault, murder, and other inhumane atrocities. The provision does not add to federal spending and utilizes mandatory federal spending provided only to the Government of Guam for taxes paid by federal personnel stationed on Guam. This is an important step towards recognizing the men, women, and children who endured injustice yet remained and remain loyal and patriotic Americans, and its inclusion this year is a hard fought victory for the people of Guam. I look forward to working with the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission, the Trump Administration and stakeholders on Guam to ensure that the war claims program is implemented in a fair, transparent and equitable manner. I will work to ensure the process is as clear to the people of Guam as possible so that we can truly bring closure to this matter. We also successfully repealed the remaining restrictions on civilian infrastructure projects related to water and wastewater, as well as the construction of a cultural artifact repository, and authorized $67.5 million for these investments. This bill also authorizes military infrastructure projects, including full funding for six military construction projects for housing, munitions, and power infrastructure development. These projects total nearly $250 million and demonstrate further the continued commitment of the U.S. government to the Guam build-up and the realignment of Marines. At the same time, this build-up must continue to reflect the 2011 Four Pillars agreement that commits the Navy to being a responsible community partner. Because of local concerns raised about land returns and how that will be calculated and tracked, we hold the Navy accountable to its ``Net Negative'' commitment by including in this bill a reporting requirement on past, current, and future Navy land usage on Guam. It is important that we have a mutual understanding about what lands will be returned to ensure that the Navy's commitment to hold no more land than it already has is upheld. There are other challenges associated with the Guam build-up that are addressed this year. The Senate Judiciary Committee majority objected to the House-passed provision that would address workforce challenges affecting the health care and construction industries by providing flexibility to U.S. Customs and Immigration Services as it evaluates H- 2B visa renewal applications. These industries directly support the military mission on Guam and having an inadequate workforce on island could negatively impact our national security. However, in order to gather additional data and continue to build the argument in order to address the situation in the coming year, there is a reporting requirement that asks the Navy to document the mission specific impacts of a reduced workforce associated with increased denials of these applications. I am deeply disappointed that this tailored provision was not ultimately included in the Conference Report but I will work with the Department of Defense to address this matter in next year's defense bill or any other appropriate legislation next year. Immediately, I will work with USCIS to see if any additional emergency authorities exist to find a temporary solution to the matter so that we do not hold up military construction projects. We must find a more permanent solution to the repeated denials of H-2B labor on Guam so we can have a stable and consistent workforce to meet construction timelines and provide critical health care to the military and residents of Guam. Additionally, ballooning cost estimates and associated scheduling delays because of Navy requirements for clearance of munitions and explosives of concern have disrupted numerous projects and need to be addressed. While the Navy has demonstrated a commitment to finding a balance that assures public safety while eliminating unnecessary, burdensome, and duplicative requirements, there is more that needs to be done. Early next spring. I expect the Navy to brief us on steps they are taking to mitigate redundancies and find acceptable efficiencies and we will continue to track this issue closely. Additionally, this bill mandates a review of distinguished Asian American and Pacific Islander war heroes who may have been unjustly overlooked in consideration of the Medal of Honor. I especially want to thank Ranking Member Smith for his leadership on issues important to Asian American Pacific Islanders (AAPIs) and working to get that provision included in the Conference report. This review was first conducted for AAPIs who served during World War II, but did not include those who served during the Korean and Vietnam Wars. Similar reviews have been conducted for African, Jewish, and Hispanic Americans and I believe that it is prudent to also conduct a comprehensive review for AAPIs who may have faced similar discrimination. It's important we appropriately recognize those who have given so much in support of our freedoms. There are numerous provisions in this year's NDAA which help develop or restate our national security priorities in the Asia-Pacific region. We included several provisions which aim to help continue to build our relationship with Taiwan, including requiring a feasibility report on replenishment stops for Taiwanese [[Page E1591]] midshipmen during their annual exercise in the Pacific as well as encouraging the U.S. and Taiwan to work together to engage in senior military leader exchanges. These will help build our bilateral relationship and provide opportunities for mutual exchange of information and training. This relationship will continue to be a critical asset for U.S. engagement in the region. We also seek to clarify and document aerial and maritime freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea. This requirement tasks the Navy and Air Force with reporting quarterly on important details pertaining to individual operations which are meant to challenge claims to disputed islands in the region and ensure freedom of navigation for all vessels and aircraft. Additionally, this report expresses a Sense of Congress in support of trilateral cooperation between the United States, Japan, and South Korea. Japan and South Korea are important American allies in the region and have taken steps to rebuild their bilateral relationship, which the U.S. must continue to encourage and foster. As we continue a unified approach to countering nuclear proliferation in North Korea, as well as deterring and destroying threats emanating from the unstable regime, there are opportunities to leverage the Guam National Guard in defense of the homeland. Building on discussions I have had with senior Army leaders, the bill report encourages the Department of the Army and the National Guard Bureau to ensure that there are resources made available in the Fiscal Year 2018 Budget to integrate the Guam Army National Guard into the security force mission for the THAAD deployed to Guam. Not only does this mission fit perfectly into the Total Force integration for which the Army has been an advocate, it contributes to Active and Reserve Component readiness, and enables the National Guard to utilize their capabilities for the homeland defense mission. The bill also continues to promote invasive specific prevention and management and regional biosecurity issues and complements appropriations legislation for the Department of Agriculture and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration which require briefing on the Regional Biosecurity Plan on recommendations that will minimize the harmful ecological, social, cultural, and economic impacts of invasive species. This will encourage the Department of Defense and other federal agencies to make progress on implementation of high priority proposals contained within the Plan. Finally, this bill provides critical funding for a number of Department of Defense programs that are important to Guam, the Asia- Pacific rebalance, and our broader national security interests. We provide critical funding to the Long Range Strike Bomber program and additional funding to keep the fielding of the MQ-4 program on track. There is also $15 million in additional funding for the Readiness and Environmental Protection Integration Program. Though there needs to be greater allocation of resources for critical programs such as the National Guard State Partnership Program and the Naval Sea Cadet Corps, we were able to protect the President's Budget Request. However, these programs and their significant return on investment merit greater funding contributions. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1590-E1591] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONFERENCE REPORT ON S. 2943, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2017 ______ speech of HON.

The bill also continues to promote invasive specific prevention and management and regional biosecurity issues and complements appropriations legislation for the Department of Agriculture and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration which require briefing on the Regional Biosecurity Plan on recommendations that will minimize the harmful ecological, social, cultural, and economic impacts of invasive species. This will encourage the Department of Defense and other federal agencies to make progress on implementation of high priority proposals contained within the Plan. Finally, this bill provides critical funding for a number of Department of Defense programs that are important to Guam, the Asia- Pacific rebalance, and our broader national security interests. We provide critical funding to the Long Range Strike Bomber program and additional funding to keep the fielding of the MQ-4 program on track. There is also $15 million in additional funding for the Readiness and Environmental Protection Integration Program. Though there needs to be greater allocation of resources for critical programs such as the National Guard State Partnership Program and the Naval Sea Cadet Corps, we were able to protect the President's Budget Request. However, these programs and their significant return on investment merit greater funding contributions. ____________________",package_114_212.csv,10065,10065,10135,"[congressional record volume 162, number 174 (monday, december 5, 2016)] [extensions of remarks] [pages e1590-e1591] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] conference report on s. 2943, national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2017 ______ speech of hon. madeleine z. bordallo of guam in the house of representatives friday, december 2, 2016 ms. bordallo. mr. speaker, i rise to speak on the fiscal year 2017 national defense authorization act, which was passed by a 375-34 vote on friday. i commend chairman thornberry, ranking member smith and the committee staff who worked many long nights on the fy17 ndaa. i worked with mr. smith and members of the committee, particularly readiness chairman rob wittman, to include a number of provisions and funding levels that will address certain readiness shortfalls and continue to support the asia-pacific rebalance. this conference agreement, along with the house report passed in may, includes a number of provisions that are particularly important for the people of guam. over the past few months of negotiations, we were able to secure the provision that authorizes the payment of claims to the survivors of the occupation of guam during world war ii and the heirs of those who were killed during the occupation. during world war ii, guam was the only u.s. civilian population occupied by japan, and during this time our people were subjected to rape, torture, assault, murder, and other inhumane atrocities. the provision does not add to federal spending and utilizes mandatory federal spending provided only to the government of guam for taxes paid by federal personnel stationed on guam. this is an important step towards recognizing the men, women, and children who endured injustice yet remained and remain loyal and patriotic americans, and its inclusion this year is a hard fought victory for the people of guam. i look forward to working with the foreign claims settlement commission, the trump administration and stakeholders on guam to ensure that the war claims program is implemented in a fair, transparent and equitable manner. i will work to ensure the process is as clear to the people of guam as possible so that we can truly bring closure to this matter. we also successfully repealed the remaining restrictions on civilian infrastructure projects related to water and wastewater, as well as the construction of a cultural artifact repository, and authorized $67.5 million for these investments. this bill also authorizes military infrastructure projects, including full funding for six military construction projects for housing, munitions, and power infrastructure development. these projects total nearly $250 million and demonstrate further the continued commitment of the u.s. government to the guam build-up and the realignment of marines. at the same time, this build-up must continue to reflect the 2011 four pillars agreement that commits the navy to being a responsible community partner. because of local concerns raised about land returns and how that will be calculated and tracked, we hold the navy accountable to its ``net negative'' commitment by including in this bill a reporting requirement on past, current, and future navy land usage on guam. it is important that we have a mutual understanding about what lands will be returned to ensure that the navy's commitment to hold no more land than it already has is upheld. there are other challenges associated with the guam build-up that are addressed this year. the senate judiciary committee majority objected to the house-passed provision that would address workforce challenges affecting the health care and construction industries by providing flexibility to u.s. customs and immigration services as it evaluates h- 2b visa renewal applications. these industries directly support the military mission on guam and having an inadequate workforce on island could negatively impact our national security. however, in order to gather additional data and continue to build the argument in order to address the situation in the coming year, there is a reporting requirement that asks the navy to document the mission specific impacts of a reduced workforce associated with increased denials of these applications. i am deeply disappointed that this tailored provision was not ultimately included in the conference report but i will work with the department of defense to address this matter in next year's defense bill or any other appropriate legislation next year. immediately, i will work with uscis to see if any additional emergency authorities exist to find a temporary solution to the matter so that we do not hold up military construction projects. we must find a more permanent solution to the repeated denials of h-2b labor on guam so we can have a stable and consistent workforce to meet construction timelines and provide critical health care to the military and residents of guam. additionally, ballooning cost estimates and associated scheduling delays because of navy requirements for clearance of munitions and explosives of concern have disrupted numerous projects and need to be addressed. while the navy has demonstrated a commitment to finding a balance that assures public safety while eliminating unnecessary, burdensome, and duplicative requirements, there is more that needs to be done. early next spring. i expect the navy to brief us on steps they are taking to mitigate redundancies and find acceptable efficiencies and we will continue to track this issue closely. additionally, this bill mandates a review of distinguished asian american and pacific islander war heroes who may have been unjustly overlooked in consideration of the medal of honor. i especially want to thank ranking member smith for his leadership on issues important to asian american pacific islanders (aapis) and working to get that provision included in the conference report. this review was first conducted for aapis who served during world war ii, but did not include those who served during the korean and vietnam wars. similar reviews have been conducted for african, jewish, and hispanic americans and i believe that it is prudent to also conduct a comprehensive review for aapis who may have faced similar discrimination. it's important we appropriately recognize those who have given so much in support of our freedoms. there are numerous provisions in this year's ndaa which help develop or restate our national security priorities in the asia-pacific region. we included several provisions which aim to help continue to build our relationship with taiwan, including requiring a feasibility report on replenishment stops for taiwanese [[page e1591]] midshipmen during their annual exercise in the pacific as well as encouraging the u.s. and taiwan to work together to engage in senior military leader exchanges. these will help build our bilateral relationship and provide opportunities for mutual exchange of information and training. this relationship will continue to be a critical asset for u.s. engagement in the region. we also seek to clarify and document aerial and maritime freedom of navigation operations in the south china sea. this requirement tasks the navy and air force with reporting quarterly on important details pertaining to individual operations which are meant to challenge claims to disputed islands in the region and ensure freedom of navigation for all vessels and aircraft. additionally, this report expresses a sense of congress in support of trilateral cooperation between the united states, japan, and south korea. japan and south korea are important american allies in the region and have taken steps to rebuild their bilateral relationship, which the u.s. must continue to encourage and foster. as we continue a unified approach to countering nuclear proliferation in north korea, as well as deterring and destroying threats emanating from the unstable regime, there are opportunities to leverage the guam national guard in defense of the homeland. building on discussions i have had with senior army leaders, the bill report encourages the department of the army and the national guard bureau to ensure that there are resources made available in the fiscal year 2018 budget to integrate the guam army national guard into the security force mission for the thaad deployed to guam. not only does this mission fit perfectly into the total force integration for which the army has been an advocate, it contributes

BILL FLORES of texas in the house of representatives Monday, December 5, 2016 Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mars, Incorporated and the 40th Anniversary of its Waco, Texas production facility. As a family-owned business since its founding in 1911, Mars has been a leading example of corporate responsibility practices that benefit the communities in which it operates. Guided by five core principles-- Quality, Responsibility, Mutuality, Efficiency, and Freedom--Mars has had a positive social and economic impact on many communities within the Seventeenth Congressional District of Texas. Since 1976, when Mars opened the doors of its facility in Waco the company has provided sustainable economic growth for our community. As such, the Waco facility currently employs over 550 full time associates, providing reliable jobs for many citizens in the District. The facility is responsible for producing both Mars Chocolate and Wrigley products, including Snickers, Skittles Candies, and Starburst Fruit Chews. In October, Mars announced its intent to combine its Chocolate and Wrigley segments to create Mars Wrigley Confectionery, which will help the company continue to deliver value to customers around the world. In addition to its commitment to producing high quality products for its consumers, the Waco facility has sought to create an environment that is mutually beneficial to the local community. For example, the Waco facility promotes sustainability and environmental efficiency through the use of a Wetlands Wastewater Treatment Facility, saving three to five million gallons of water each year. The facility also uses locally sourced peanuts in its Snickers bars, and it sponsors the annual Waco Wild West Century Bike Tour to raise money for the American Red Cross. In recognition of its outstanding commitment to diversity and unity in the workplace, the Waco facility recently received the Model of Unity Award from the Community Race Relations Coalition. On behalf of the Seventeenth Congressional District and the State of Texas, I am pleased to celebrate this important milestone with Mars' Waco facility, and I thank Mars for its continued dedication to our community. As I close, I ask everyone to continue praying for our country, and for our military and first responders who selflessly serve and sacrifice to protect us. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 174 (Monday, December 5, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1591] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING MARS, INCORPORATED AND THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF ITS WACO, TEXAS PRODUCTION FACILITY _____ HON.
