(c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that-- (1) a policy or practice by the government of any foreign country of routinely denying visa applications for religious workers can be indicative of a poor state of religious freedom in that country; and (2) the United States Government should seek to reverse any such policy by reviewing the entirety of the bilateral relationship between such country and the United States.

On the date on which the President's annual budget request is submitted to Congress, the Secretary shall submit an annual report to the appropriate congressional committees that includes a report on staffing levels for the International Religious Freedom Office.''. (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that maintaining an adequate staffing level at the Office, such as was in place during fiscal year 2016, is necessary for the Office to carry out its important work. SEC. 102. ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM. (a) In General.--Section 102(b)(1) of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6412(b)(1)) is amended-- (1) in the matter preceding subparagraph (A), by striking ``September 1'' and inserting ``May 1''; (2) in subparagraph (A)-- (A) in clause (iii), by striking ``; and'' and inserting ``as well as the routine denial of visa applications for religious workers;''; (B) by redesignating clause (iv) as clause (vii); and (C) by inserting after clause (iii) the following: ``(iv) particularly severe violations of religious freedom in that country if such country does not have a functioning government or the government of such country does not control its territory; ``(v) the identification of prisoners, to the extent possible, in that country pursuant to section 108(d); ``(vi) any action taken by the government of that country to censor religious content, communications, or worship activities online, including descriptions of the targeted religious group, the content, communication, or activities censored, and the means used; and''; (3) in subparagraph (B), in the matter preceding clause (i)-- (A) by inserting ``persecution of lawyers, politicians, or other human rights advocates seeking to defend the rights of members of religious groups or highlight religious freedom violations, prohibitions on ritual animal slaughter or male infant circumcision,'' after ``entire religions,''; and (B) by inserting ``policies that ban or restrict the public manifestation of religious belief and the peaceful involvement of religious groups or their members in the political life of each such foreign country,'' after ``such groups,''; (4) in subparagraph (C), by striking ``A description of United States actions and'' and inserting ``A detailed description of United States actions, diplomatic and political coordination efforts, and other''; and (5) in subparagraph (F)(i)-- (A) by striking ``section 402(b)(1)'' and inserting ``section 402(b)(1)(A)(ii)''; and (B) by adding at the end the following: ``Any country in which a non-state actor designated as an entity of particular concern for religious freedom under section 301 of the Frank R.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to dispense with the reading of the amendment. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, eighteen years ago, Congress had the foresight to pass the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998. That landmark bill made advancing the right to religious freedom a U.S. foreign policy priority. The International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 needed to be upgraded to meet some of the new challenges of the 21st century. This bill, the Frank Wolf International Religious Freedom Act of 2016, accomplishes that goal by integrating international religious freedom into U.S. foreign policy; improving the ability of the U.S. government to advance religious freedom globally through enhanced diplomacy, training, counterterrorism, and foreign assistance efforts; and giving the Secretary of State stronger and more flexible political responses to growing religious freedom violations. Religion is an even more relevant foreign policy issue today than it was eighteen years ago. From China and Vietnam to Syria and Nigeria, we are witnessing a tragic, global crisis in religious persecution, violence and terrorism, with dire consequences for religious minorities and for U.S. national security. The biggest threats to our nation often come from those most violently opposed to religious freedom. Thus, the promotion of religious liberty is not an isolated human rights concern, but a fundamental component of our national security. The global religious freedom crisis we are experiencing today has created millions of victims and undermines liberty, prosperity and peace in places vital to U.S. national interests--posing direct challenge to the U.S. interests in the Middle East, Russia, China and sub-Saharan Africa. Ancient Christian communities in Iraq and Syria are on the verge of extinction and other religious minorities in the Middle East face a constant assault from the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). ISIS is committing genocide, mass atrocities, and war crimes to advance its cause--they must be stopped and those facing genocide must be giving the assistance. A robust religious freedom diplomacy is necessary to advance U.S. interests in stability, security, and economic development. Research has shown that where there is more [[Page H7584]] religious freedom, there is more economic freedom, more women's empowerment, more political stability, more freedom of speech, and less terrorism. More than ever before, vigorous U.S. leadership and diplomacy are needed to address religious freedom violations globally. It is clear that our national security will depend on the protection and advancement of this fundamental freedom. The Frank Wolf International Religious Freedom Act will upgrade the tools and used by the Administration to improve U.S. religious freedom diplomacy efforts globally; better trained and equipped diplomats to counter extremism; address anti-Semitism and religious persecution, and mitigate sectarian conflict. The bill does this by: Requiring that the Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom report directly to the Secretary of State. Elevating the position of the Ambassador within the Federal Government: Gives the Ambassador responsibilities to coordinate religious freedom policy throughout the government; develop training curriculum for all Foreign Service officers; and administer grants to promote religious freedom policy globally. Requiring training in international religious freedom for all Foreign Service Officers: Requires development of curriculum and training for all incoming Foreign Service Officers and for Deputy Chiefs of Mission and Ambassadors going out to new posts. The curriculum used by the State Department will be made available to the U.S. Military and other relevant government agencies. Creating an ``Entity of Particular Concern'' Designation for Non- State Actors: Gives the Secretary of State authority to designate as ``entities of particular concern'' in recognition of the fact that in the 21st century some of the most egregious religious freedom violations are committed by non-state actors. Requiring more frequent Presidential actions to counter severe religious freedom violations globally: Requires annual Country of Particular Concern (CPC) designations. Limits the number of sanctions waivers (except in cases of the national interest) and requires more frequent reporting on countries where sanction waivers are used. Creating a comprehensive Religious Prisoner's List: Lists of religious prisoners would be made available upon request from Members of Congress. Increasing congressional oversight of State Department actions against individual religious freedom violators through the creation of a ``Designated Persons List:'' The list will include individuals who have been denied a visa or sanctioned because of their involvement in severe violations of religious freedom. Congress will receive frequent and regular updates on the list. Requiring the State Department to create a ``Special Watch List'' of countries that tolerate severe violations of religious freedom but which may fail to meet the CPC threshold. Sets Congressional Expectations for Staffing of the IRF Office and Expansion of Religious Freedom Program Grants: Requires ``appropriate staff' for the IRF office and seeks office staffing at FY 16 levels. Urges the State Department to request ``sufficient funding for vigorous promotion'' of international religious freedom policy. The bill is named after former Congressman Frank Wolf, a tireless champion for the rights of the poor and the persecuted globally. 18 years ago, he had the foresight to make advancing the right to religious freedom a high U.S. foreign policy priority. It is largely because of his efforts that religious freedom is taken seriously as a foreign policy issue. I had the distinct honor and pleasure of working with him for over thirty years. This bill is a fitting tribute to his work and service to our great nation. I want to thank Rep. Anna Eshoo for her partnership on this legislation and her advocacy on behalf of religious minorities in the Middle East and the cause of all those oppressed for the beliefs they hold. I also want to thank Senator Marco Rubio for his commitment to the cause of human rights and international religious freedom and for his assistance in getting this bill passed in the Senate. As with many pieces of bipartisan legislation, this bill would not have gotten this far without the assistance of many individuals and groups invested in its passage. I want to thank Senators Bob Corker, and Ben Cardin, for assisting with the bill's amendment and passage on the Senate side. Congressman Ed Royce and Eliot Engel and their staff for helping to move this bill on a bipartisan basis through the House. Also, I want to recognize the contribution David Saperstein, the Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom, who's worked to strengthen the bill and assure its passage. Finally, I want to recognize and thank the many staff members, in the House and Senate, who have worked hard for this bill's passage over the past two years including, Scott Flipse, Elyse Anderson, Mary Noonan, Hannah Murphy, Caleb McCarry, Jaime Fly, Doug Anderson, Piero Tozzi, Sajit Gandhi, and Janice Kaguyutan. International religious freedom is not a partisan or party issue. The freedom to practice a religion without persecution is a precious right for everyone, of whatever race, sex, status, or location on earth. This human right is enshrined in our own founding documents, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and is a bedrock principle of open and democratic societies for centuries. We Americans understand the importance of religious liberty. It is the First Freedom on which our nation was founded. We should be united in defending it, standing up for those who suffer grievously for its absence, and for the noble and essential cause of protecting our own country. I urge passage of this bill without objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the original request of the gentleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 180 (Tuesday, December 13, 2016)] [House] [Pages H7580-H7584] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FRANK R.

Sense of Congress regarding national security strategy to promote religious freedom through United States foreign policy.''. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey (during the reading). Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to dispense with the reading of the amendment. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, eighteen years ago, Congress had the foresight to pass the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998. That landmark bill made advancing the right to religious freedom a U.S. foreign policy priority. The International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 needed to be upgraded to meet some of the new challenges of the 21st century. This bill, the Frank Wolf International Religious Freedom Act of 2016, accomplishes that goal by integrating international religious freedom into U.S. foreign policy; improving the ability of the U.S. government to advance religious freedom globally through enhanced diplomacy, training, counterterrorism, and foreign assistance efforts; and giving the Secretary of State stronger and more flexible political responses to growing religious freedom violations. Religion is an even more relevant foreign policy issue today than it was eighteen years ago. From China and Vietnam to Syria and Nigeria, we are witnessing a tragic, global crisis in religious persecution, violence and terrorism, with dire consequences for religious minorities and for U.S. national security. The biggest threats to our nation often come from those most violently opposed to religious freedom. Thus, the promotion of religious liberty is not an isolated human rights concern, but a fundamental component of our national security. The global religious freedom crisis we are experiencing today has created millions of victims and undermines liberty, prosperity and peace in places vital to U.S. national interests--posing direct challenge to the U.S. interests in the Middle East, Russia, China and sub-Saharan Africa. Ancient Christian communities in Iraq and Syria are on the verge of extinction and other religious minorities in the Middle East face a constant assault from the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). ISIS is committing genocide, mass atrocities, and war crimes to advance its cause--they must be stopped and those facing genocide must be giving the assistance. A robust religious freedom diplomacy is necessary to advance U.S. interests in stability, security, and economic development. Research has shown that where there is more [[Page H7584]] religious freedom, there is more economic freedom, more women's empowerment, more political stability, more freedom of speech, and less terrorism. More than ever before, vigorous U.S. leadership and diplomacy are needed to address religious freedom violations globally. It is clear that our national security will depend on the protection and advancement of this fundamental freedom. The Frank Wolf International Religious Freedom Act will upgrade the tools and used by the Administration to improve U.S. religious freedom diplomacy efforts globally; better trained and equipped diplomats to counter extremism; address anti-Semitism and religious persecution, and mitigate sectarian conflict. The bill does this by: Requiring that the Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom report directly to the Secretary of State. Elevating the position of the Ambassador within the Federal Government: Gives the Ambassador responsibilities to coordinate religious freedom policy throughout the government; develop training curriculum for all Foreign Service officers; and administer grants to promote religious freedom policy globally. Requiring training in international religious freedom for all Foreign Service Officers: Requires development of curriculum and training for all incoming Foreign Service Officers and for Deputy Chiefs of Mission and Ambassadors going out to new posts. The curriculum used by the State Department will be made available to the U.S. Military and other relevant government agencies. Creating an ``Entity of Particular Concern'' Designation for Non- State Actors: Gives the Secretary of State authority to designate as ``entities of particular concern'' in recognition of the fact that in the 21st century some of the most egregious religious freedom violations are committed by non-state actors. Requiring more frequent Presidential actions to counter severe religious freedom violations globally: Requires annual Country of Particular Concern (CPC) designations. Limits the number of sanctions waivers (except in cases of the national interest) and requires more frequent reporting on countries where sanction waivers are used. Creating a comprehensive Religious Prisoner's List: Lists of religious prisoners would be made available upon request from Members of Congress. Increasing congressional oversight of State Department actions against individual religious freedom violators through the creation of a ``Designated Persons List:'' The list will include individuals who have been denied a visa or sanctioned because of their involvement in severe violations of religious freedom. Congress will receive frequent and regular updates on the list. Requiring the State Department to create a ``Special Watch List'' of countries that tolerate severe violations of religious freedom but which may fail to meet the CPC threshold. Sets Congressional Expectations for Staffing of the IRF Office and Expansion of Religious Freedom Program Grants: Requires ``appropriate staff' for the IRF office and seeks office staffing at FY 16 levels. Urges the State Department to request ``sufficient funding for vigorous promotion'' of international religious freedom policy. The bill is named after former Congressman Frank Wolf, a tireless champion for the rights of the poor and the persecuted globally. 18 years ago, he had the foresight to make advancing the right to religious freedom a high U.S. foreign policy priority. It is largely because of his efforts that religious freedom is taken seriously as a foreign policy issue. I had the distinct honor and pleasure of working with him for over thirty years. This bill is a fitting tribute to his work and service to our great nation. I want to thank Rep. Anna Eshoo for her partnership on this legislation and her advocacy on behalf of religious minorities in the Middle East and the cause of all those oppressed for the beliefs they hold. I also want to thank Senator Marco Rubio for his commitment to the cause of human rights and international religious freedom and for his assistance in getting this bill passed in the Senate. As with many pieces of bipartisan legislation, this bill would not have gotten this far without the assistance of many individuals and groups invested in its passage. I want to thank Senators Bob Corker, and Ben Cardin, for assisting with the bill's amendment and passage on the Senate side. Congressman Ed Royce and Eliot Engel and their staff for helping to move this bill on a bipartisan basis through the House. Also, I want to recognize the contribution David Saperstein, the Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom, who's worked to strengthen the bill and assure its passage. Finally, I want to recognize and thank the many staff members, in the House and Senate, who have worked hard for this bill's passage over the past two years including, Scott Flipse, Elyse Anderson, Mary Noonan, Hannah Murphy, Caleb McCarry, Jaime Fly, Doug Anderson, Piero Tozzi, Sajit Gandhi, and Janice Kaguyutan. International religious freedom is not a partisan or party issue. The freedom to practice a religion without persecution is a precious right for everyone, of whatever race, sex, status, or location on earth. This human right is enshrined in our own founding documents, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and is a bedrock principle of open and democratic societies for centuries. We Americans understand the importance of religious liberty. It is the First Freedom on which our nation was founded. We should be united in defending it, standing up for those who suffer grievously for its absence, and for the noble and essential cause of protecting our own country. I urge passage of this bill without objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the original request of the gentleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 180 (Tuesday, December 13, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 180 (Tuesday, December 13, 2016)] [House] [Pages H7580-H7584] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FRANK R.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to dispense with the reading of the amendment. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, eighteen years ago, Congress had the foresight to pass the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998. That landmark bill made advancing the right to religious freedom a U.S. foreign policy priority. The International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 needed to be upgraded to meet some of the new challenges of the 21st century. This bill, the Frank Wolf International Religious Freedom Act of 2016, accomplishes that goal by integrating international religious freedom into U.S. foreign policy; improving the ability of the U.S. government to advance religious freedom globally through enhanced diplomacy, training, counterterrorism, and foreign assistance efforts; and giving the Secretary of State stronger and more flexible political responses to growing religious freedom violations. Religion is an even more relevant foreign policy issue today than it was eighteen years ago. From China and Vietnam to Syria and Nigeria, we are witnessing a tragic, global crisis in religious persecution, violence and terrorism, with dire consequences for religious minorities and for U.S. national security. The biggest threats to our nation often come from those most violently opposed to religious freedom. Thus, the promotion of religious liberty is not an isolated human rights concern, but a fundamental component of our national security. The global religious freedom crisis we are experiencing today has created millions of victims and undermines liberty, prosperity and peace in places vital to U.S. national interests--posing direct challenge to the U.S. interests in the Middle East, Russia, China and sub-Saharan Africa. Ancient Christian communities in Iraq and Syria are on the verge of extinction and other religious minorities in the Middle East face a constant assault from the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). ISIS is committing genocide, mass atrocities, and war crimes to advance its cause--they must be stopped and those facing genocide must be giving the assistance. A robust religious freedom diplomacy is necessary to advance U.S. interests in stability, security, and economic development. Research has shown that where there is more [[Page H7584]] religious freedom, there is more economic freedom, more women's empowerment, more political stability, more freedom of speech, and less terrorism. More than ever before, vigorous U.S. leadership and diplomacy are needed to address religious freedom violations globally. It is clear that our national security will depend on the protection and advancement of this fundamental freedom. The Frank Wolf International Religious Freedom Act will upgrade the tools and used by the Administration to improve U.S. religious freedom diplomacy efforts globally; better trained and equipped diplomats to counter extremism; address anti-Semitism and religious persecution, and mitigate sectarian conflict. The bill does this by: Requiring that the Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom report directly to the Secretary of State. Elevating the position of the Ambassador within the Federal Government: Gives the Ambassador responsibilities to coordinate religious freedom policy throughout the government; develop training curriculum for all Foreign Service officers; and administer grants to promote religious freedom policy globally. Requiring training in international religious freedom for all Foreign Service Officers: Requires development of curriculum and training for all incoming Foreign Service Officers and for Deputy Chiefs of Mission and Ambassadors going out to new posts. The curriculum used by the State Department will be made available to the U.S. Military and other relevant government agencies. Creating an ``Entity of Particular Concern'' Designation for Non- State Actors: Gives the Secretary of State authority to designate as ``entities of particular concern'' in recognition of the fact that in the 21st century some of the most egregious religious freedom violations are committed by non-state actors. Requiring more frequent Presidential actions to counter severe religious freedom violations globally: Requires annual Country of Particular Concern (CPC) designations. Limits the number of sanctions waivers (except in cases of the national interest) and requires more frequent reporting on countries where sanction waivers are used. Creating a comprehensive Religious Prisoner's List: Lists of religious prisoners would be made available upon request from Members of Congress. Increasing congressional oversight of State Department actions against individual religious freedom violators through the creation of a ``Designated Persons List:'' The list will include individuals who have been denied a visa or sanctioned because of their involvement in severe violations of religious freedom. Congress will receive frequent and regular updates on the list. Requiring the State Department to create a ``Special Watch List'' of countries that tolerate severe violations of religious freedom but which may fail to meet the CPC threshold. Sets Congressional Expectations for Staffing of the IRF Office and Expansion of Religious Freedom Program Grants: Requires ``appropriate staff' for the IRF office and seeks office staffing at FY 16 levels. Urges the State Department to request ``sufficient funding for vigorous promotion'' of international religious freedom policy. The bill is named after former Congressman Frank Wolf, a tireless champion for the rights of the poor and the persecuted globally. 18 years ago, he had the foresight to make advancing the right to religious freedom a high U.S. foreign policy priority. It is largely because of his efforts that religious freedom is taken seriously as a foreign policy issue. I had the distinct honor and pleasure of working with him for over thirty years. This bill is a fitting tribute to his work and service to our great nation. I want to thank Rep. Anna Eshoo for her partnership on this legislation and her advocacy on behalf of religious minorities in the Middle East and the cause of all those oppressed for the beliefs they hold. I also want to thank Senator Marco Rubio for his commitment to the cause of human rights and international religious freedom and for his assistance in getting this bill passed in the Senate. As with many pieces of bipartisan legislation, this bill would not have gotten this far without the assistance of many individuals and groups invested in its passage. I want to thank Senators Bob Corker, and Ben Cardin, for assisting with the bill's amendment and passage on the Senate side. Congressman Ed Royce and Eliot Engel and their staff for helping to move this bill on a bipartisan basis through the House. Also, I want to recognize the contribution David Saperstein, the Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom, who's worked to strengthen the bill and assure its passage. Finally, I want to recognize and thank the many staff members, in the House and Senate, who have worked hard for this bill's passage over the past two years including, Scott Flipse, Elyse Anderson, Mary Noonan, Hannah Murphy, Caleb McCarry, Jaime Fly, Doug Anderson, Piero Tozzi, Sajit Gandhi, and Janice Kaguyutan. International religious freedom is not a partisan or party issue. The freedom to practice a religion without persecution is a precious right for everyone, of whatever race, sex, status, or location on earth. This human right is enshrined in our own founding documents, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and is a bedrock principle of open and democratic societies for centuries. We Americans understand the importance of religious liberty. It is the First Freedom on which our nation was founded. We should be united in defending it, standing up for those who suffer grievously for its absence, and for the noble and essential cause of protecting our own country. I urge passage of this bill without objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the original request of the gentleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_274.csv,46326,46326,46398,"[congressional record volume 162, number 180 (tuesday, december 13, 2016)] [house] [pages h7580-h7584] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] frank r. wolf international religious freedom act mr. smith of new jersey. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent to take from the speaker's table the bill (h.r. 1150) to amend the international religious freedom act of 1998 to improve the ability of the united states to advance religious freedom globally through enhanced diplomacy, training, counterterrorism, and foreign assistance efforts, and through stronger and more flexible political responses to religious freedom violations and violent extremism worldwide, and for other purposes, with the senate amendment thereto, and concur in the senate amendment. the clerk read the title of the bill. the speaker pro tempore. the clerk will report the senate amendment. the clerk read as follows: senate amendment: strike all after the enacting clause and insert the following: section 1. short title; table of contents.

improving the ability of the u.s. government to advance religious freedom globally through enhanced diplomacy, training, counterterrorism, and foreign assistance efforts; and giving the secretary of state stronger and more flexible political responses to growing religious freedom violations. religion is an even more relevant foreign policy issue today than it was eighteen years ago. from china and vietnam to syria and nigeria, we are witnessing a tragic, global crisis in religious persecution, violence and terrorism, with dire consequences for religious minorities and for u.s. national security. the biggest threats to our nation often come from those most violently opposed to religious freedom. thus, the promotion of religious liberty is not an isolated human rights concern, but a fundamental component of our national security. the global religious freedom crisis we are experiencing today has created millions of victims and undermines liberty, prosperity and peace in places vital to u.s. national interests--posing direct challenge to the u.s. interests in the middle east, russia, china and sub-saharan africa. ancient christian communities in iraq and syria are on the verge of extinction and other religious minorities in the middle east face a constant assault from the so-called islamic state of iraq and syria (isis). isis is committing genocide, mass atrocities, and war crimes to advance its cause--they must be stopped and those facing genocide must be giving the assistance. a robust religious freedom diplomacy is necessary to advance u.s. interests in stability, security, and economic development. research has shown that where there is more [[page h7584]] religious freedom, there is more economic freedom, more women's empowerment, more political stability, more freedom of speech, and less terrorism. more than ever before, vigorous u.s. leadership and diplomacy are needed to address religious freedom violations globally. it is clear that our national security will depend on the protection and advancement of this fundamental freedom. the frank wolf international religious freedom act will upgrade the tools and used by the administration to improve u.s. religious freedom diplomacy efforts globally; better trained and equipped diplomats to counter extremism; address anti-semitism and religious persecution, and mitigate sectarian conflict. the bill does this by: requiring that the ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom report directly to the secretary of state. elevating the position of the ambassador within the federal government: gives the ambassador responsibilities to coordinate religious freedom policy throughout the government; develop training curriculum for all foreign service officers; and administer grants to promote religious freedom policy globally. requiring training in international religious freedom for all foreign service officers: requires development of curriculum and training for all incoming foreign service officers and for deputy chiefs of mission and ambassadors going out to new posts. the curriculum used by the state department will be made available to the u.s. military and other relevant government agencies. creating an ``entity of particular concern'' designation for non- state actors: gives the secretary of state authority to designate as ``entities of particular concern'' in recognition of the fact that in the 21st century some of the most egregious religious freedom violations are committed by non-state actors. requiring more frequent presidential actions to counter severe religious freedom violations globally: requires annual country of particular concern (cpc) designations. limits the number of sanctions waivers (except in cases of the national interest) and requires more frequent reporting on countries where sanction waivers are used. creating a comprehensive religious prisoner's list: lists of religious prisoners would be made available upon request from members of congress. increasing congressional oversight of state department actions against individual religious freedom violators through the creation of a ``designated persons list:'' the list will include individuals who have been denied a visa or sanctioned because of their involvement in severe violations of religious freedom. congress will receive frequent and regular updates on the list. requiring the state department to create a ``special watch list'' of countries that tolerate severe violations of religious freedom but which may fail to meet the cpc threshold. sets congressional expectations for staffing of the irf office and expansion of religious freedom program grants: requires ``appropriate staff' for the irf office and seeks office staffing at fy 16 levels. urges the state department to request ``sufficient funding for vigorous promotion'' of international religious freedom policy. the bill is named after former congressman frank wolf, a tireless champion for the rights of the poor and the persecuted globally. 18 years ago, he had the foresight to make advancing the right to religious freedom a high u.s. foreign policy priority. it is largely because of his efforts that religious freedom is taken seriously as a foreign policy issue. i had the distinct honor and pleasure of working with him for over thirty years. this bill is a fitting tribute to his work and service to our great nation. i want to thank rep. anna eshoo for her partnership on this legislation and her advocacy on behalf of religious minorities in the middle east and the cause of all those oppressed for the beliefs they hold. i also want to thank senator marco rubio for his commitment to the cause of human rights and international religious freedom and for his assistance in getting this bill passed in the senate. as with many pieces of bipartisan legislation, this bill would not have gotten this far without the assistance of many individuals and groups invested in its passage. i want to thank senators bob corker, and ben cardin, for assisting with the bill's amendment and passage on the senate side. congressman ed royce and eliot engel and their staff for helping to move this bill on a bipartisan basis through the house. also, i want to recognize the contribution david saperstein, the ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom, who's worked to strengthen the bill and assure its passage. finally, i want to recognize and thank the many staff members, in the house and senate, who have worked hard for this bill's passage over the past two years including, scott flipse, elyse anderson, mary noonan, hannah murphy, caleb mccarry, jaime fly, doug anderson, piero tozzi, sajit gandhi, and janice kaguyutan. international religious freedom is not a partisan or party issue. the freedom to practice a religion without persecution is a precious right for everyone, of whatever race, sex, status, or location on earth. this human right is enshrined in our own founding documents, in the universal declaration of human rights, and is a bedrock principle of open and democratic societies for centuries. we americans understand the importance of religious liberty. it is the first freedom on which our nation was founded. we should be united in defending it, standing up for those who suffer grievously for its absence, and for the noble and essential cause of protecting our own country. i urge passage of this bill without objection. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the original request of the gentleman from new jersey? there was no objection. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",46326

BARBARA COMSTOCK of virginia in the house of representatives Tuesday, December 13, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to acknowledge Skyler Powell on becoming the first cadet in the history of Purcellville, Virginia's VIKING Sea Cadet Division to achieve the rank of Chief Petty Officer. This is a tremendous honor considering that historically only 1 percent of the U.S. Naval Sea Cadet Corps' 10,000 cadets receive this appointment, and of that 1 percent only 20 percent have been female. I am proud to represent this young woman, who is a shining example of the Commonwealth of Virginia's hardworking and service-minded citizens. The United States Naval Sea Cadet Corps, which was founded over 50 years ago, is a federally chartered non-profit civilian organization that serves to teach individuals about naval operations, community service, citizenship, and helps foster discipline and teamwork in our nation's youth. In addition to the courses, training and exams, Powell developed and demonstrated dedication, leadership, self-reliance, commitment and courage as she rose through the cadet ranks. During summer break, she attended a two-week recruit training, a shortened version of the Navy's boot camp. She has also attended multiple advanced trainings on topics including marksmanship, cyber security and advanced music training in locations from San Francisco and Las Vegas, to Fort Custer and Fort Lee. She also served as a staff cadet at recruit training in Aberdeen, Maryland and Navy League orientation training in Norfolk, Virginia. Chief Powell has earned the Veterans of Foreign Wars' Naval Sea Cadet Medal and the Sons of the American Revolution Good Citizenship Award in addition to maintaining a 4.1 GPA while taking honors and AP classes. During her Sea Cadet career she has logged over 250 volunteer community service hours. She is likewise an active member of the Loudoun Valley High School Marching Band and currently leads the VIKING Division CyberPatriot team--a nationwide cyber security competition sponsored by the U.S. Air Force. Mr. Speaker, I would ask my colleagues to congratulate Skyler Powell for her promotion to Chief Petty Officer in Purcellville's VIKING Sea Cadet Division, and to join me in wishing her a happiness and fortune in her future endeavors. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 180 (Tuesday, December 13, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1713] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF SKYLER POWELL'S PROMOTION TO CHIEF PETTY OFFICER ______ HON.

A leading voice for promoting equity and education for women and girls in our community, AAUW Thousand Oaks and its members have examined and taken positions on the fundamental educational, social, economic, and political issues that directly pertain to women and girls. As part of a national movement, AAUW Thousand Oaks is part of a nationwide network of more than 170,000 members and donors, 1,000 branches, and 800 college and university institutional partners and has awarded millions of dollars in fellowships and grants to support women in their professional and academic careers. Additionally, AAUW Thousand Oaks boasts being one of the fastest growing divisions of the national organization. Locally, in an effort to promote science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, AAUW Thousand Oaks bi-annually hosts the Brighter Horizons Math, Science and Technology Conference for students in fifth through ninth grades. Led by women in technology- related vocations, the conference is infused with technology information workshops that relate to currently important technological career options in an effort to promote young women going into the field of science. Every summer, AAUW Thousand Oaks' Tech Trek Committee works towards sending ten female students that have matriculated from the seventh grade in the Thousand Oaks area to a one-week STEM education camp at the University of California, Santa Barbara. AAUW Thousand Oaks also demonstrates its dedication to youth in our community through their Youth Cultural Summer Camp, Children's Theater, and local scholarships programs that help high school and community college students afford educational programs. In recognition of its progressive efforts towards women in our community, AAUW Thousand Oaks has also been recognized for its ``Outstanding Mission Based Programs'' at the state level of the organization by AAUW of California. On the occasion of its 50th anniversary, I would like to congratulate the American Association of University Women of Thousand Oaks for its outstanding leadership and steadfast commitment to advancing equity for women and girls in the Conejo Valley. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 180 (Tuesday, December 13, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1713] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITY WOMEN OF THOUSAND OAKS ______ HON.

John Glenn did indeed possess the `right stuff,' as the writer Tom Wolfe documented in his 1979 best-selling book about the first Project Mercury astronauts selected for the NASA space program.

Mr. Speaker, today I rise in recognition of my friend and former colleague California State Senator Fran Pavley, a dedicated and driven member of the California State Legislature, who is being honored for her outstanding leadership, steadfast advocacy, and invaluable dedication to public service. For over three decades, Senator Pavley has been a widely accomplished legislator. Throughout her career, she has authored groundbreaking and historic legislation to protect and realize a better future for the State of California. Senator Pavley has been one of the state's greatest environmental champions. [[Page E1714]] Senator Pavley has played an instrumental role in landmark policies and initiatives to protect California's environment and its natural resources. She is the author of Assembly Bill 1493, which became the framework for vehicle emissions standards on the national level. She also wrote Assembly Bill 32, the nation's first cap on greenhouse gas pollution. These bills have served as a catalyst for innovation and job growth in clean and renewable energy as well as alternative fuels. Senator Pavley's work had a monumental impact on national emissions policies when President Obama implemented national clean car standards, modeled on Assembly Bill 1493, also known as the ``Pavley Law.'' Senator Pavley continued her dedicated campaign of environmental protection when she paved the way to end unregulated hydraulic fracturing and other oil-extraction practices in California. In 2013, she coauthored successful legislation to invest $2 billion in effective air-quality and clean vehicle and fuel technology programs. In a time of historic drought for California, Senator Pavley and her expansive knowledge and background has been an important figure in addressing this complex issue and its vast impact on the state. In 2014, Senator Pavley authored innovative and pioneering legislation for the state's management of groundwater. This bill helped to negotiate a bipartisan water bond that was approved by voters, which authorized $7.12 billion in general obligation bonds for state water supply infrastructure projects. Additionally, Senator Pavley has been an unwavering advocate for her constituents. Her career has been marked with legislative victories on an array of issues including stronger consumer protections, tougher child safety laws, and tighter reforms for campaign contributions. Senator Pavley has spent a lifetime working for her constituents Los Angeles and Ventura counties. For these reasons, it is with heartfelt appreciation that I am pleased to join the Ventura County Women's Political Council in recognizing Senator Fran Pavley. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 180 (Tuesday, December 13, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1713-E1714] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING CALIFORNIA STATE SENATOR FRAN PAVLEY ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, on November 15, 2016, the Aloha State lost the Honorable Clift Tsuji, a soldier, a Hawaii State Representative, and a loving father. Born and raised in the plantation town of Papa`ikou, Representative Clift Tsuji served the people of Hawaii Island throughout his 75 years of life. After graduating from Hilo High School in 1959, Representative Tsuji served as a U.S. Army Reservist with the 442nd Infantry, Company B, out of Hilo from 1959-1965. He completed post-secondary degrees at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and the University of Washington, Pacific Coast Banking School. In 1969, he began work at Central Pacific Bank, beginning a career with Central Pacific that spanned 34 years. After retiring from Central Pacific Bank in 2003, he served as the Vice President of the Hilo Candy Company until 2004, when he was elected to serve the people of Keaukaha, Pana`ewa, Waiakea, and parts of Hilo in the Hawai`i House of Representatives. In the State House, Representative Tsuji served as the Chair of the House Agriculture Committee, where he helped champion legislation to fight invasive species and strengthen Hawai`i's biosecurity. His dedicated service on the House Agriculture Committee was widely recognized, and among many other awards, he was named the Hawai`i Farm Bureau's Legislator of the Year in 2015. Representative Tsuji was known to his constituents as a passionate leader, a dedicated public servant, and an advocate for the Hilo community. In addition to his work in business and government, he was an active member of many local and statewide organizations including the Hilo Medical Center Foundation, Hawai`i Island Japanese Community Association, Tsunami Museum, Hiroshima Kenjin Kai, Hawai`i Island Chamber of Commerce, and the Kumamoto Kenjin Kai. One of the last conversations Representative Tsuji had with his son Ryan was about making sure he could continue to pass important legislation for his constituents in the next legislative session. Whether it was a construction project in Hilo, or a biosecurity bill benefitting the entire State of Hawai`i, Representative Tsuji was committed to delivering results for his constituents and the people of the Aloha State. Just a few days before his death, I saw Representative Tsuji at the Hilo Veterans Parade and, as usual, he was full of aloha, as he welcomed me to the community he loved so much. My heart is with his children, Ryan and Ashley, and all of Hawai`i Island. Clift, you are missed. Mahalo nui loa (thank you) for dedicating your life to serving our community in the spirit of aloha. Ke Akua me ke Aloha (God bless you). ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 180 (Tuesday, December 13, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1714] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE OF HAWAI`I STATE REPRESENTATIVE CLIFT TSUJI ______ HON.

Born and raised in the plantation town of Papa`ikou, Representative Clift Tsuji served the people of Hawaii Island throughout his 75 years of life. After graduating from Hilo High School in 1959, Representative Tsuji served as a U.S. Army Reservist with the 442nd Infantry, Company B, out of Hilo from 1959-1965. He completed post-secondary degrees at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and the University of Washington, Pacific Coast Banking School. In 1969, he began work at Central Pacific Bank, beginning a career with Central Pacific that spanned 34 years. After retiring from Central Pacific Bank in 2003, he served as the Vice President of the Hilo Candy Company until 2004, when he was elected to serve the people of Keaukaha, Pana`ewa, Waiakea, and parts of Hilo in the Hawai`i House of Representatives. In the State House, Representative Tsuji served as the Chair of the House Agriculture Committee, where he helped champion legislation to fight invasive species and strengthen Hawai`i's biosecurity. His dedicated service on the House Agriculture Committee was widely recognized, and among many other awards, he was named the Hawai`i Farm Bureau's Legislator of the Year in 2015.

SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Tuesday, December 13, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the House Committee on the Judiciary and Homeland Security Committee, Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations, and the Congressional Voting Rights Caucus, I rise today to express my initial views regarding the President-Elect's nomination of U.S. Senator Jefferson Beauregard ``Jeff'' Sessions III of Alabama to be the next Attorney General of the United States. On Election Night the President-Elect pledged to the nation that he would be a president to all Americans. That pledge will ring hollow to tens of millions of Americans in light of his announced intention to nominate one of the U.S. Senate's most far-right members, Senator Jeff Sessions (R-AL) to be the next Attorney General of the United States. Perhaps nothing would do more to reassure the American people that the President-Elect is committed to unifying the nation than the nomination and appointment of a person to be Attorney General who has a record of championing and protecting, rather than opposing and undermining, the precious right to vote, the constitutionally guaranteed right of privacy, criminal justice reform, and support for reform of the nation's immigration system so that it is fair and humane. The nomination of Alabama Senator Sessions as Attorney General does not inspire the necessary confidence. As a U.S. Senator from Alabama, the state from which the infamous Supreme Court decision in Shelby County v. Holder originated, Senator Sessions has failed to play a constructive role in repairing the damage to voting rights caused by that decision. He was one of the leading opponents of the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. He is one of the Senate's most hostile opponents of comprehensive immigration reform and was a principal architect of the draconian and incendiary immigration policy advocated by the President-Elect during the campaign. His record in support of efforts to bring needed reform to the nation's criminal justice system is virtually non-existent. In 1986, ten years before Senator Sessions was elected to the Senate, he was rejected for a U.S. District Court judgeship in view of documented incidents that revealed his lack of commitment to civil and voting rights, and to equal justice. His Senate voting record and rhetoric has endeared him to white nationalist websites and organizations like Breitbart and Stormfront. Should the President-Elect proceed with the nomination of Senator Sessions to be Attorney General, I call upon the Senate Judiciary Committee to subject the nomination to the most comprehensive, searching, and withering examination. The United States has been blessed to have been served as Attorney General by such illustrious figures as Robert Jackson, Robert Kennedy, Herbert Brownell, Ramsey Clark, Nicholas Katzenbach, Eric Holder, and Edward H. Levi. The duty of the U.S. Attorney General is to lead the Department of Justice in protecting and expanding the civil rights of all Americans and the pursuit of equal justice for all, not to turn back the clock on hard won rights and liberties. No Senator should vote to confirm the nomination of Jeff Sessions as U.S. Attorney General if there is the slightest doubt that he possesses the character, qualities, integrity, and commitment to justice and equality needed to lead a department, the headquarters building of which is named for Robert F. Kennedy, one of the nation's greatest and most indefatigable champions of civil rights and equal justice for all. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 180 (Tuesday, December 13, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1714] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REGARDING NOMINATION OF SENATOR JEFF SESSIONS OF ALABAMA TO BE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES ______ HON.

JULIA BROWNLEY of california in the house of representatives Tuesday, December 13, 2016 Ms. BROWNLEY of California. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in recognition of my friend and ally [[Page E1715]] Henry L. ``Hank'' Lacayo, a lifelong leader and advocate, who is being honored for his selfless dedication and invaluable leadership to bettering our community and country. Born in 1931 in Los Angeles, Mr. Lacayo grew up in the depths of the Great Depression and the Second World War, fighting through a time of economic uncertainty and racial injustice. Determined to serve his country, Mr. Lacayo first attempted to join the military at the age of 16. Although he was originally turned away, he quickly joined upon graduating high school and served in the United States Army Air Corps. Following his military service, Mr. Lacayo began his career in 1953 at North American Aviation and became involved with United Auto Workers of America Local 887. Nine years later, he was elected President of the UAW Local, a position in which he represented the interests of over 30,000 workers and their families. Through his steadfast leadership, Mr. Lacayo was appointed National Director of the Political and Legislative Department of the UAW. While working in this capacity, Mr. Lacayo served as an advisor under Democratic Presidential Administrations from John F. Kennedy to Bill Clinton. In 1986, Mr. Lacayo retired from the UAW and subsequently formed H. L. & Associates, a consulting firm that enabled him to continue to be involved in labor relations issues, as well as other government, seniors, and international issues. Today, Mr. Lacayo continues to give back to his community by serving as President of the Congress of California Seniors, where he continues to dedicate his time to advocating for a better quality of life for others. Additionally, Mr. Lacayo is actively preparing the next generation of leaders, public servants, and community activists. Founded in 2010 at California State University Channel Islands, the Henry L. ``Hank'' Lacayo Institute for Workforce & Community Studies facilitates student internships, scholarly research, and the dissemination of policy information and recommendations. In the program, students learn the essential skill sets to change lives and positively impact communities. Mr. Lacayo has spent his lifetime working for Ventura County and our nation. His hard work and dedication--which has ranged from serving in the Army Air Corps, to actively fighting for working families and California's seniors, and now passing down his knowledge and experience to students who will continue his influential work--has helped to create a better America. For these reasons, it is with genuine appreciation that I am pleased to join United Way of Ventura County in recognizing Henry ``Hank'' Lacayo for his lifetime achievements. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 180 (Tuesday, December 13, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1714-E1715] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING HENRY L. ``HANK'' LACAYO ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, today I rise in recognition of my friend and ally [[Page E1715]] Henry L. ``Hank'' Lacayo, a lifelong leader and advocate, who is being honored for his selfless dedication and invaluable leadership to bettering our community and country. Born in 1931 in Los Angeles, Mr. Lacayo grew up in the depths of the Great Depression and the Second World War, fighting through a time of economic uncertainty and racial injustice. Determined to serve his country, Mr. Lacayo first attempted to join the military at the age of 16. Although he was originally turned away, he quickly joined upon graduating high school and served in the United States Army Air Corps. Following his military service, Mr. Lacayo began his career in 1953 at North American Aviation and became involved with United Auto Workers of America Local 887. Nine years later, he was elected President of the UAW Local, a position in which he represented the interests of over 30,000 workers and their families. Through his steadfast leadership, Mr. Lacayo was appointed National Director of the Political and Legislative Department of the UAW. While working in this capacity, Mr. Lacayo served as an advisor under Democratic Presidential Administrations from John F. Kennedy to Bill Clinton. In 1986, Mr. Lacayo retired from the UAW and subsequently formed H. L. & Associates, a consulting firm that enabled him to continue to be involved in labor relations issues, as well as other government, seniors, and international issues. Today, Mr. Lacayo continues to give back to his community by serving as President of the Congress of California Seniors, where he continues to dedicate his time to advocating for a better quality of life for others.

SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Tuesday, December 13, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to demand on behalf of the American people that the President-Elect disclose, detail, and divest, or place in a genuine blind trust, all, of his financial holdings prior to taking the oath of office so as to avoid major conflicts of interest and to comply with the Emoluments Clause of U.S. Constitution. As chief steward of America's extensive domestic, global, and national security interests, the fidelity of the President of the United States to the national interest must never be subject to question or doubt. The President-Elect's extensive financial interests in more than 100 companies operating in more than 18 countries and on five continents potentially represent major conflicts of interest which can only be remedied by complete divestment or placing all of his assets in a genuine blind trust. As reflected in recent media reports, a preliminary analysis of the President-Elect's extensive financial arrangements reveals dozens of potential conflicts of interest. For example, the President-Elect has received more than $10 million from his interest in the Trump Towers Istanbul in Turkey, a country with which the United States has extensive, complicated, and politically sensitive military and diplomatic relations. Similarly, since August 2015, the President-Elect's business organizations has registered eight separate companies connected to hotel deals in Saudi Arabia, which is located in one of the world's most critical geopolitical regions. Based on the limited and inadequate financial disclosures he has made to date, it appears that the President-Elect's business organization is financially dependent upon, and obligated to, Deutsche Bank, its biggest lender, which happens to be negotiating a multibillion-dollar settlement over housing-crisis-era abuses with the Justice Department, a deal that will be finalized with Justice Department officials appointed by the President-Elect. Companies owned or controlled by the President-Elect's organization also owe hundreds of millions of dollars to the state-owned Bank of China and to Wall Street interests. The American people are entitled to assume without hesitation or doubt that when the President of the United States meets with foreign leaders and dignitaries that he is motivated only by what is in the national interest and not the private, pecuniary interests of himself, his family members, or his business enterprises. That assurance cannot be provided when the President of the United States has enormous financial stakes in the enterprises operating in those same foreign countries. It is for this reason--to ensure that the President's loyalty will always be to the nation he leads--that the Framers included the Emoluments Clause in Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution, which provides that ``no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.'' According to leading experts in ethics, a prohibited emolument would include, for example, anything from a foreign government that benefits the President-Elect, such as providing favorable tax, zoning, licensing treatment for his real estate holdings or enhanced security to protect his business operations. The financial interests of the President-Elect are extensive, complex, and inter-connected with the interests of foreign leaders and countries. They are all-encompassing and time-consuming. But they pale in comparison to the global, diplomatic, economic, and national security interests of the United States, which supersede the interests of any one person or corporation. As the Scriptures teach, you cannot serve two masters. The President-Elect must make a choice and act accordingly before he takes the oath of office. Either divest all of his financial interests or place them in a genuine blind trust or refrain from taking the oath of office and assuming the responsibility to ``take care that the Laws be faithfully executed'' and ``to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.'' ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 180 (Tuesday, December 13, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1715] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEMANDING THE PRESIDENT-ELECT TO DISCLOSE, DETAIL, AND TOTALLY DIVEST FINANCIAL HOLDINGS TO AVOID CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND TO COMPLY WITH EMOLUMENTS CLAUSE OF U.S. CONSTITUTION ______ HON.

First established in 1918 with the founding club in Santa Barbara, District 5240 has grown along California's central coast, throughout the counties of San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and Ventura. District 5240 also bears the distinction as one of the oldest Rotary clubs nationally, founded only thirteen years after the original club, the Rotary Club of Chicago, was established. With a membership of 3,500 members, from 74 clubs in four different counties, Rotary International District 5240 meets regularly to not only develop its own communities but communities around the world. As a member of one of the world's largest service organization, Rotary International District 5240 has established itself with remarkable charitable work ranging from leading polio eradication efforts since 1985 to a focus on promoting global peace, fighting disease, providing international aid for access to clean water and life-saving care to mothers and children, as well as supporting educational programs, and growing local economies. Most recently, Rotary International District 5240 has led relief efforts for Hurricane Matthew victims on behalf of our community. Locally, the organization has been a critical partner in economic and community development, and has donated over $250,000 to fund microfinance loans that have helped start or grow local businesses over the past four years. For these reasons, it is with great enthusiasm that I recognize Rotary International District 5240, which is celebrating the centennial anniversary of the Rotary Foundation, for the immeasurable ways the organization has contributed to our community as a whole. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 180 (Tuesday, December 13, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1716] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING ROTARY INTERNATIONAL DISTRICT 5240 ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the House Committees on the Judiciary and Homeland Security Committee; Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations, and the Congressional Voting Rights Caucus, I rise today to address efforts that may be taken in various states to recount votes cast for candidates for the office of President of the United States in the recent election. The linchpin of representative democracies such as the United States is public confidence in the political system, regime, and community. That confidence in turn rests upon the extent to which the public has faith that the system employed to select its leaders accurately reflects its preferences. At bottom, this means that all citizens casting a vote have a fundamental right and reasonable expectation that the votes cast count and are counted. We know from experience that it not uncommon that occasionally vote counts reported in an initial canvass may later prove to be inaccurate because sometimes votes are overlooked or inaccurately credited to the wrong candidate. Vote recounts have long been recognized as an essential safeguard to correct errors of this type. Recounts have occurred at the local, state, and, as we saw in 2000, presidential level. It should be noted also that the November 8, 2016 election is the first presidential election held since the Supreme Court issued the notorious decision in Shelby County v. Holder, which neutered the preclearance provisions of the Voting Rights Act and adversely affected the ability of hundreds of thousands of persons to cast a ballot and have their vote counted. Also, as is the case this year, where the results in the Electoral College and of the popular vote diverge by the largest and most astounding margin in American history, it is particularly fitting and appropriate to ensure that any uncertainty over the accuracy of the vote determining any state's electoral votes be resolved as fairly and expeditiously as possible. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 180 (Tuesday, December 13, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1716] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REGARDING PRESIDENTIAL VOTE RECOUNTS IN THE SEVERAL STATES ______ HON.

GREG WALDEN of oregon in the house of representatives Tuesday, December 13, 2016 Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the non-profit Bend Heroes Foundation of Bend, Oregon, for its outstanding dedication to Oregon's veterans of the Armed Services. As a member of the National Honor Flight Network, the Foundation has honored over 550 World War II Oregon heroes who helped save the world from tyranny over seven decades ago. It has been my high honor to welcome them to Washington, D.C. and present each World War II veteran with a flag flown over our nation's Capitol in his or her honor. The Foundation created the Bend Heroes Memorial to honor Bend's veterans who served and died during war from World War I to the present. It was my privilege to help dedicate the memorial on Veterans Day back in 2009. The Foundation also inaugurated the Bend Parade of Flags program displaying 300 flags in Bend on eight patriotic days each year. I was again privileged to provide those flags and have them flown over our nation's Capitol. Furthering their efforts, the Foundation worked with the Oregon Legislature to create six war veterans highways across Oregon: World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Persian Gulf/Afghanistan and Iraq and the Purple Heart Trail. Sixty-seven honorific signs have been installed on 1,730 miles of border-to-border highways, in total honoring 500,000 Oregon war veterans. The Bend Heroes Foundation also created the Oregon Medal of Honor Exhibit to celebrate 26 Oregonians who received our nation's highest award for valor above and beyond the call of duty during combat from the Civil War to Vietnam. Mr. Robert ``Bob'' Maxwell of Bend is one of the World War II recipients, and at 96 he is our nation's oldest living recipient. It was a privilege for me to provide him with a large American flag flown over the U.S. Capitol. That flag is now prominently displayed at the Foundation's exhibit in McMinnville. I would also like to honor the members of the Bend Heroes Foundation for their tireless efforts: Chairman Dick Tobiason, President Erik Tobiason, Vice President-Secretary Yvonne Drury, Treasurer Priscilla Reich, Directors Bob Dent, Denny Drury, Joe Gallagher, Mike Genna, Harley Kelley, Bob Maxwell, Darla Rozelle, Rob Walker and Diane Harris, and Volunteers Candace Kelley, Mike Brock, Sid Poe, and John and Jean Frye. All serve without pay and are extremely proud of their efforts.

DAVID E. PRICE of north carolina in the house of representatives Tuesday, December 13, 2016 Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, as the 114th Congress comes to a close, I have introduced the Swine Waste Infrastructure and Natural Environment Act (the SWINE Act, or H.R. 6483). I am hopeful that this bill will provoke constructive discussions and suggestions in the coming weeks from stakeholders in the agricultural and environmental communities, so that I can introduce an improved version early next year. The SWINE Act builds on efforts in North Carolina and elsewhere to develop new technologies to manage and dispose of waste from animal agricultural production, replacing the current ``lagoon and spray- field'' method used by many swine producers. In 1999, the environmental impact of lagoon and spray-field waste disposal systems was made particularly acute by Hurricane Floyd, an unusually large storm which caused poorly-regulated hog lagoons to overflow and discharge untreated animal waste into water systems across Eastern North Carolina. But for years prior to the storm, large animal feeding operations had emitted noxious odor and threatened the air and water quality of small rural communities across the Southeast. In the aftermath of Hurricane Floyd, forward-thinking leaders in North Carolina initiated a process in which industry, academia, and the environmental community worked together to identify waste disposal technologies that would mitigate the worst environmental effects of the lagoon and spray-field system. The effort sparked a vigorous public discussion on issues related to swine waste while fostering a period of technological innovation in waste processing technology. For nearly a decade, I helped secure federal assistance for the research and development of environmentally sound methods of processing swine waste and for technical assistance to producers who sought to adopt such technologies. While this process resulted in significant progress toward a viable alternative to lagoon and spray-fields, the technologies developed thus far fell short of the established threshold for economic feasibility and have thus not been widely adopted by producers. The environmental and social threats posed by the lagoon and spray- field method are not limited to North Carolina, and thus require a national solution. With additional investments in research and development and incentives for technology adoption, the technologies developed in North Carolina and elsewhere--or new technologies yet to be developed--can be made market-ready, producing an affordable and environmentally superior replacement for lagoon and spray-field. We should not be forced to choose between a clean environment and a successful, innovative animal agriculture industry. With this bill, I believe we can improve the environment while remaining the world leader in animal agricultural production. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 180 (Tuesday, December 13, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1717] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF H.R. 6483, THE SWINE WASTE INFRASTRUCTURE AND NATURAL ENVIRONMENT ACT (THE SWINE ACT) ______ HON.

The environmental and social threats posed by the lagoon and spray- field method are not limited to North Carolina, and thus require a national solution.

DAVID E. PRICE of north carolina in the house of representatives Tuesday, December 13, 2016 Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, as the 114th Congress comes to a close, I have introduced the Swine Waste Infrastructure and Natural Environment Act (the SWINE Act, or H.R. 6483). I am hopeful that this bill will provoke constructive discussions and suggestions in the coming weeks from stakeholders in the agricultural and environmental communities, so that I can introduce an improved version early next year. The SWINE Act builds on efforts in North Carolina and elsewhere to develop new technologies to manage and dispose of waste from animal agricultural production, replacing the current ``lagoon and spray- field'' method used by many swine producers. In 1999, the environmental impact of lagoon and spray-field waste disposal systems was made particularly acute by Hurricane Floyd, an unusually large storm which caused poorly-regulated hog lagoons to overflow and discharge untreated animal waste into water systems across Eastern North Carolina. But for years prior to the storm, large animal feeding operations had emitted noxious odor and threatened the air and water quality of small rural communities across the Southeast. In the aftermath of Hurricane Floyd, forward-thinking leaders in North Carolina initiated a process in which industry, academia, and the environmental community worked together to identify waste disposal technologies that would mitigate the worst environmental effects of the lagoon and spray-field system. The effort sparked a vigorous public discussion on issues related to swine waste while fostering a period of technological innovation in waste processing technology. For nearly a decade, I helped secure federal assistance for the research and development of environmentally sound methods of processing swine waste and for technical assistance to producers who sought to adopt such technologies. While this process resulted in significant progress toward a viable alternative to lagoon and spray-fields, the technologies developed thus far fell short of the established threshold for economic feasibility and have thus not been widely adopted by producers.

If the President-Elect takes seriously his Election Night pledge to be a president to ``all Americans,'' he must immediately renounce his intention to appoint Steven Bannon as White House Senior Counselor and Strategist. Steven Bannon has a long history promoting racial and ethnic bigotry, sexism, religious intolerance, and misogyny. He has insinuated that African-Americans are `naturally aggressive and violent,' and under his leadership, Breitbart's publishing strategy turned to one that has made it the media arm of the racist ``Alt- Right'' movement, publishing articles promoting popular white nationalist tropes such as ``black on white crime'' and that ``rape culture'' is inherent in Islam. In selecting Steven Bannon as one of his two most trusted White House advisors, the President-Elect is signaling to the American people that the inflammatory, reckless, and insensitive rhetoric and tactics employed by his campaign can be expected to become part of his Administration's standard operating procedure.

Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Kathy Long upon her retirement from outstanding and invaluable public service to the residents of the Third District on the Ventura County Board of Supervisors. For well over two decades, her steadfast leadership and immeasurable contributions to our community have been held in the highest regard throughout the region. Supervisor Long's commitment to the success of Ventura County is truly commendable. She has been relentless in her efforts to promote Ventura County's economic growth and vitality, protect and strengthen Naval Base Ventura County, prioritize public safety and support the social safety net, conserve our natural resources, preserve our agricultural sector, as well as address the needs of Ventura County's veterans. Moreover, she has ensured a better future for Ventura County and its residents through her remarkable advocacy and tenacity. Supervisor Long's service to Ventura County extends well beyond her role on the Board of Supervisors. She has continually sought and worked to be an agent of change in her community through other undertakings including active participation on the Board of Directors of the Economic Development Collaborative-Ventura County, as Co-Chair of the Regional Defense Partnership for the 21st Century, as Chair of the County of Ventura Medical Oversight Committee, as Commissioner of the First 5 Commission, and through her establishment of the Ventura County Women's Economic Roundtable. In addition, Supervisor Long has served as the Ventura County Board of Supervisor's representative to the California State Association of Counties (CSAC) and served on the Executive Board as Chair of the Urban Counties Caucus. She has also served as Co-Chair of the Women's Leadership Forum, Poverty Working Group, and Coastal Counties Regional Association. In recognition of her tremendous and impactful work, Supervisor Long was recognized as ``Woman of the Year'' in 2015 by the California State Legislature, ``Legislator of the Year'' in 2013 by the Chamber of Commerce Alliance of Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties, awarded the ``Housing Hero Award'' in 2011 by the Cabrillo Economic Development Corporation, received the American Red Cross Clara Barton ``Public Servant of the Year'' award in 2005, and was acknowledged as the ``Public Servant of the Year'' for 2002-2003 by the Camarillo Chamber of Commerce. I humbly applaud Supervisor Kathy Long for her demonstrative dedication and tireless efforts to our community, and Ventura County as a whole. It has been my great honor to work with Supervisor Long throughout the years. I have been fortunate to call her a colleague, an ally, and a friend. Supervisor Long has established a wonderful legacy of hard work and good governance in the public sector, and she has shown that she has a huge heart for Ventura County. As she retires from the Ventura County Board of Supervisors and enters a whole new chapter in her life, I am confident that this is not the end of her endeavors as an advocate on behalf of our community. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 180 (Tuesday, December 13, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1718] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRATULATING KATHY LONG ______ HON.

BARBARA COMSTOCK of virginia in the house of representatives Tuesday, December 13, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to use this time in recognition of Elizabeth Minor, the beloved Mayor of Winchester, Virginia. Mayor Minor is retiring from her office after twelve years of dedicated service to the people of Winchester. During her time as Mayor and as a member of the City Council, Winchester has experienced a renaissance that has transformed the city into an extraordinary place to live, work and study. There is no one who has had a greater impact on creating this transformation than Mayor Elizabeth Minor. Always willing to speak at gatherings of Winchester residents, Mayor Minor was always prepared with the perfect message for each occasion. She has tirelessly used her special position in the community to unify and encourage people of all ages, races and incomes. Elizabeth's tenure as Mayor has been marked by many successes, including significant improvements to the city's education system, improvements to the Jim Barnett Park, the transformation of Old Town Winchester and the beautification of the gateways to the city. Additionally, when cities and states across the country are struggling to develop budgets, her stewardship has helped Winchester to win the Distinguished Budget Presentation Award from the Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada for four years in a row. Elizabeth Minor served as Vice-Mayor of Winchester from 1994 to 2004, and has been a member of the City Council since 1980. Her nearly four decades of selfless service to her community will serve as a benchmark for the [[Page E1718]] future leaders of this great city for years to come. Mr. Speaker, I now ask that my colleagues join me in thanking Mayor Elizabeth Minor for her exemplary service and unwavering dedication to the people of Winchester, Virginia.
